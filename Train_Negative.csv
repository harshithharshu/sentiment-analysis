"I had big expectations because I love English TV, in particular Investigative and detective stuff but this guy is really boring. It didn't appeal to me at all."
he's OK. His humor consists mainly of varying between a Vietnamese accent and a smooth articulate presentation of ironic situations.
"hope they start changing the plot a little faster, never seen so many pole changes in one show in one week"
I used to watch this as a kid. We could only get it when the atmospheric conditions were just right and the tv antenna was turned to just the right direction to get the one station that played this at 10pm. They would show this as a double feature with Dark Shadows. It is fascinating to see how much has changed in how we treat each other and how tv is made.
"The first season of ""The Outer Limits"" was the best. Sure the second season had some classic episodes (among them ""Solider"" and ""Demon with a Glass Hand"" which inspired James Cameron to come up with ""The Terminator"". I'd give the shows here 5 stars but 0 stars to MGM for this reissue. Why? Because these are the exact same digital transfers as last time. They haven't been enhanced with any thing AND there are no extras. I'd average that out to 2 stars for this set.Don't get me wrong--the first season was terrific for the most part. This set (like the first season set) features the moving ""The Man Who Was Never Born"" with Martin Landau as a scarred victim of a viral holocaust who is given the chance to go back in time and prevent the birth of the man who created his sterile world. Featuring a rich score by the late Domninic Frontiere (among his best), this was ""The Outer Limits"" as its best. Also we get ""The Galaxy Being"" with Cliff Roberson who unwittingly brings an alien creature he has been communicating with from a world made of anti-matter into ours causing destruction and death. David McCallum in ""The Sixth Finger"" about the results of an experiment to push humanity to evolve to the next level but how, in the process, we lose the essence of what makes us human.""The Zanti Misfits"" like much of Stefano's work provides a neat allegory about human nature. We also get ""The Borderlands"" and many other classic episodes mixed with claptrap like ""Human Factor"" but almost everything here is terrific even if we're only getting half a season at a higher price than before.Why not include a commentary track from surviving actors or David J. Suchow the author on the definitive book on ""The Outer Limits""? Because MGM is convinced that you'll buy this set and the second one coming out in August AND pay more in the process because they've split them up. Heck, the least they could have done was got rid of those dreadful dual sided discs. Nope. These are dual sided as well.So what do you get? 16 episodes--half the first season of the series. In August you can get the second half of the first season. I'm at a loss here--why release the exact same thing as before only in a different package? The only reason is so that retailers (such as Best Buy) who return things after a limited shelf life will carry this again. If you're going to do this at least give us some extras (a featurette on the visual effects, vintage interviews with the late Joe Stefano or Leslie Stevens, commentary tracks with Suchow discussing the making of the episode.The show deserves 5 stars but Sony/MGM deserves 0 stars for this reissue. Get this instead.The Outer Limits - The Original Series, Season 1"
"Man, things were going great for the most violent prime time TV show ever (less the killing of Curtis - one of those moments where clearly the writers simply wants to shock the audience or need to get rid of the actor for some reason). Things went downhill (in my humble opinion)after the Fayed plot was solved. By ""downhill"" I don't mean disater, because a show of this magnitude, where each episode has so many differnt scenarios, shot on locatiosns cenes, special effects, etc, rarely is mediocre. You get the feel that the everyone involved is giving their best.What I mean by downhil is the above mentioned people (cast, producers, technical guys, writers) giving their best for a flawed premise. The Chinese / Russian plot was so farfetched, so forced, so  unplausible. After all, the advantage of obtaining some secret technologie about your enemy is useful since he does not know that you possess his defense technology! Also, to see Audrey Raines appears only briefly and as a ""zombie"" was a bad call.Well, that's it. Anyway, I think the show still did not jump the shark, but this will happen soon."
Just finished watching season 6 on DVD. (I live in Europe and it has been out a few weeks already) Dumbest ideas ever in 24. Fox should definetely fire the writers! There got to be more qualified people out there?Don`t buy it. Rather buy season 5 (which was great)
"Based on a lot of the reviews that are already posted here, I don't think there are a whole lot of people calling it like it is. So, I will take it upon myself to be the voice of truth about VERONICA MARS season 3. There are 5 star people raving about it because they love the show and are unwilling to accept the truth and there are 1 star people who aren't giving the 3rd season a fair assesment.There is not a single show on TV, not a single one, that my wife and I don't flock to week to week, other than VERONICA MARS and the 3rd season was no exception. As the 3rd season played out, we found ourselves completely involved as we had been the previous 2 season, all the way up to the midseason cliff hanger. A serial rapist. A murder on campus. All the suspense and mystery was in tact and juicy as ever.Then, when the show started back up, all the things that we had gotten involved in were solved in the first handful of episodes. The following episodes were, for lack of better words, UNEVENTFUL. All the way up to the odd and uncomfortable season finale that ended with the yawning cast of a vote.Even my wife was shocked at the abrupt and uneventful ending. What did they do? What happened? Did the writers lose interest? Did the network pull the plug on the show before they wrote the final episodes? This is what I think. Personally, I believe the only thing that explains the weak ending of the 3rd season would be that the writers and producers knew that the CW had given up on them. So, they in turn, gave up on the CW.All speculation aside, VERONICA MARS fell off the table halfway through the 3rd season. The charm and personality of the characters and actors involved was still intact, but the stories being told were in par with a fledgling show instead of a show that has given us some of the best television moments around over it's 2 1/2 prior seasons.The CW just needs to face the facts. The ratings that they're suffering aren't because of quality of show, but because of lack of STATIONS and lack of bribing the NIELSON and ARBITRON companies... like the big boys do... cause we're watching... and unfortunately, we're not watching VERONICA MARS anymore."
"Wait, Veronica is a freshman at imaginary U!  Not being a fan of the original Veronica Mars series, I found this one hard to swallow and even harder to engage in.  Maybe old fanboys and girls will enjoy seeing their favorite characters &#34;aged&#34; for this new series, but as a newcomer I found little to like or engage me."
"You know the plot. Trashy kids being trashy. The &#34;good&#34; ones are the &#34;poor&#34; ones. The rich trashy kids are just &#34;bad&#34;. Another movie to help the retarded careers of this TV show's actors. They are all old and washed out. But they still try to be hip and cool with their texting and foul mouths, sex videos. Sorry if you can't route for the heroine of the movie it clearly isn't worth watching."
"There's a scene in Misery where the author writes what he thinks his nurse/tormentor wants to read and suffers for his presumption. Her main problem is the fact that he cheated when he explained that his heroine was alive, but there was also the fact that he was second guessing his audience. Instead of writing something that he could be proud of, he wrote something that he thought that the audience wanted. In many ways, the decline in quality of Veronica Mars reflected this issue. In the third season of Veronica Mars, Rob Thomas veered away from the season long arc and the feminist context and chose instead to focus on shorter story arcs and one-off episodes that didn't tie into the arcs. Instead of making the show easy for potential new fans, Thomas disappointed the existing fans.There was also the issue of the heroine graduating from high school. The teenage detective angle worked better when the setting was high school and there was a great metaphor about tying in hard boiled mysteries with high school where no one really is what they appear to be. Buffy recovered from the same setback, but just barely.This movie tries to go in the opposite direction of the third season by making a movie that is solely for the fans but retains that same desperate &#34;LOVE ME&#34; vibe that wrecked the last season. A little fan service is nice. It's cool to see Mac and Wallace again. Veronica working to solve the case and manipulating the police force to do it is fine. It's even nice to see Veronica and Logan fall into their old patterns.Ken Marino has established himself in comedic roles in shows like Party Down and Children's Hospital so why not bring back Vinnie Van Lowe.Yet, a little goes a long way and too much just becomes aggravating. Do we really need to get Piz again? Especially when he is still the nice guy that Veronica basically ignores. Does Madison have to be a one-dimensional villain ten years later? Weevil shows up to AGAIN end up on the wrong side of the law. Krysten Ritter appears and then reminds everyone who she was in season 2. The only strange moment of restraint in the movie was not bringing back Adam Scott as the teacher who had sex with a student even though the movie revolves around Carrie Bishop who accused him of rape in the Mars vs. Mars episode from season 1. When the ten year reunion has a tribute to the dead classmates, you almost expect it to take over the movie since there were a lot of dead high school students on the show.With all the fan service, the director and writer forget to tell a compelling story. It's a two hour episode with references that require the Veronica Mars wiki to fully get. Unfortunately, as you are referring to the Wiki, you are getting spoiled for the rather pedestrian mystery - which should already be obvious since it follows the &#34;really popular cult actor shows up in a minor role&#34; pattern.This isn't a bad movie. It just isn't a very good movie."
Once again TV Types get it WRONG Lying is Lying is LYING .... and so the whole premise of a person becoming better TANKS ... watch the rest on the internet for free .... don't support these writers ...
"I found these people to be liars, crooks, backstabbers and cons,yet they are portrayed as heroes, that just does not compute getreal they are crooks plain and simple."
"I tried three times to watch this series, but I cannot get past the first episode, where the main characters (who remember, we are all supposed to be able to relate to)lie, cheat, steal, assault, bilk, pilfer, pickpocket, participate in vehicular homicide and then escape to a life of the super-rich. No, they all should have just been caught, arrested, tried and thrown in prison, end of series.I love Eddie Izzard as a comedian and as an actor, but this series simply crosses my ethical lines; you do not make heroes out of villains, you just don't send that message to the world, unless you make it clear that what you are promoting and supporting and suggesting EVIL as a justified way of life. Just because they are part of an even worse criminal element, that does not forgive them for their actions, which they never have to face, that does not give the producers the right to present an upside-down morality play as if it were OK to just kill someone, take over their life, impersonate them, and go about your business as if nothing evil happened, or that it wasn't your fault.So I'll just prop the soapbox up over here and quietly walk away, while you figure out why you want to watch bad people get away with bad things."
"This programme surprised me as not veryy funny in lots of ways. By trying to be as offending and gross as possible, Sarah Silverman actually achieves the opposite: she bores us to death at times. There is a great lack in consistency in the writing which makes it very difficult to watch any episode in its entirety."
"I love this genre but just could not get into this series.Girl leaves town with no gas in the tank, bar full of people ignoring the firetruck as it blasts out a warning that the radioactive mushroom cloud is coming in 45 minutes, the only two cars on the road within 10 miles and they run head on into each other? Who writes this stuff?"
"I think Jericho has some great actors.  Unfortunately the story really isn't as great or as accurate as the writers want you to believe.All these cities have just been destroyed, and yet, more often than not, the people are remaining extremely calm in the small town, and actually having unrealistic conversations about what their future would be like involved in relationships and whatnot.If over 20 cities had been destroyed, setting my sights on my future would be the *last* thing I would be thinking about- just trying to survive should be important enough.  There should be more confusion and uncertainty going on in that small town more than anything else.  Not these emotional scenes that in real life would never happen.There's some nice twists from some of the main characters, but it is pretty hard keeping up with everything, and understanding what's going on can be a difficult enough task.  Still, it's not a bad show, but it's not the best, and it's kind of overrated."
"Yet another &#34;apocolypse&#34; show written by &#34;big city dwellers&#34; who have a total &#34;city centered&#34; view of EVERYTHING.Let me start by sayiing that the premise of the shows &#34;disaster&#34; is not too bad.  We are drawn in by being left guessing as to the nature of what has happened.This is where it wanders off the path.  The small town of Jericho is nothing more than a minature version of New York or LA from other movies.  with the exception of one or two &#34;farms,&#34; EVERYTHING ceases to exist at the town limits.  A character is either &#34;of the town&#34; or an &#34;outsider&#34; and that is it.It is plainly obvious that the writers have never spent any time in the real world, outside of a big city.  Rural America does not work like this.  Small towns blur.  The town limits rarely really limit the towns themselves and they often sort of blend into nearby communities and they really do encompass surrounding rural areas.  This is not europe and the local twons here are not, and never were, the local strongholds, complete with castle.No, while the initial premise of this series is well thought out, the mechanics of it are way out of touch with the reality of life in rural America.  It lost my interest in the middle of the first season and I can readily see why it died so quickly.  Big city dwellers would have no interest, whatsoever, and real rural citizens are just going to take one look and turn it off.  It could have been done much better."
"The Jericho premise is fresh and interesting. But I just finished watching the pilot and I find that the story line is weighed down by the poorly developed characters and a lot of cliches about small town America. It is entirely peopled by ""aw shucks"" ""salt-of-the-earth"" folks. The kind of people you will never meet in the real world, not even in Kansas. Maybe the writers should visit fly over country to get a better sense of what they're writing about."
"I just do not like the main character.The only person who seems to like him, is his Mother.His ex-girlfriend hates him, his brother is furious with him, his father is dissapointed with him.Nobody (actors, seem to have a clear line on who they're supposed to be).So far, after 7 episodes,for the first Season, I don't know who, or what anyone is either.Is the owner of the general store, just a stone beetch? Is the IRS auditor just a stone beetch?There is so much good TV. I do not have time to try to figure out what the writers of this show were trying to get across. In my opinion, they had a dart board in their office, and threw darts at it, to see which ones stayed.I'm definately, not willing to watch 18 or so hours of this floundering program."
This could have been an interesting series if not for the turgid script and the banal soap operish love triangles.
"I started off liking the show, but it soon lost my interest.  I found much of it to be rather maudlin.  The series is just not very well written."
"I see now why TV is considered a wasteland. This TV show is stupid. These TV producers have a formula, then the produce a TV show, like Jericho. And where do these immature male leading characters come from? The guy is 32. He acts like he is 12. Sad."
"What show are the rest of these reviewers watching? I was excited to see this after reading the reviews, but barely made it through the first two hours. Incredibly boring, like a lavish network soap with all that implies. The history is sketchy; if you're going to twist history, at least make it fun and appealing in some way that the truth does not.This is one of the slowest and most unpleasant tv shows I have seen in some time. Then again, I don't watch tv, only tv shows on dvd that reviewers I usually trust found to be good. Guess that's not the best way either! Oh well, I found The Office (the funny version) and Arrested Development that way, so it can't be all bad. Didn't work this time, though.Pass."
I watched this long after I should have quit hoping it would become redeming in some way but it kept getting worse.  I would not recommend it.
"I don't care for this version of BG. First, Boomer and Starbuck are women they should have made them men. Don't get me wrong their should be women fighter pilots but because they were 2 of the main characters practically every episode was about sexual intrigue, jealousy, and who's sleeping with who this week. Secondly, they use bullets instead of lasers. My guess is the producers did this to save money on special effects. Third, the society of this advanced culture still has people smoking and alcoholics and they haven't even cured cancer. A society enlightend and advanced as this(at least 100-200 years or more advanced than earth) would have cured the addiction of smoking and acoholism and/or outlawed it. Almost every actor was a drinker, smoker or both. I suspect tobacco companies and alcohol beverage companies paid the actors and probably the producers under the table to smoke in the series. They also would have cured cancer and almost every other disease. It looks like they were practicing 1940's medicine."
"Season 2 through the first few episodes of season 3 which I consider part of the season 1-2 story line were great.  Season 3 the writers missed the mark by a large margin.  I just finished forcing myself to watch season 3.  The first two seasons I couldn't believe I had missed this show when it was on, after season 3 I'm speechless at the waste of time it was.  All sorts of character development which should have been woven into the first two seasons, and only warranted being short flashbacks and segments of the better shows to fill in some blanks as to why certain characters where the way they were, but to waste a season on it?  The whole farce of a story around the man who allowed the original attack and became president only to have him walk free?  I've wanted to personally put him out an airlock since episode 2 of season 1 and they finally get his butt on trial and let him walk?  Its not a letdown, it is maddening that I wasted the time.  I understand Season 4 picks up and gets back on track thank god.  Bottom line is except for the freeing from New Caprica the rest of season 3 was not worth watching.  All the background on the Admirals marriage, and the character background should have been boiled down to 10% of the first two seasons, not stretched through an entire season 3.  Oh, and let's just have a season where the enemy just goes away and focus on labor unions and peoples dysfunctional childhoods.  Frak them all."
"so i truly enjoyed the first two seasons of Battlestar...truly awesome, military sci/fi show, insane sets, great plot, good acting and those Cylons. all great....the end of season two had some difficulties. alot ALOT less action and more crying. lots of crying. lots of drama. lots of forgetting the entire purpose of the show.season three is where ive ended my battlestar lust....i truly cant take Starbuck anymore, whiny brat...could care less about her romantic interests nor her false bravado.entire spisodes went by with nary a mention of the Cylons.....which, lets be honest...is the best thing about the show.it seems they lost focus or they changed course to appeal to the more 'dramatic' aspects while shelving the 'sci/fi' alltogether.terrible mistake.... i fear season three is when i say frack off Battlestar....you had a AMAZING thing going."
"We only watched a few of the episodes because though we like what Glenn Close has done in the past, we found this series very difficult to follow with the confusing flashbacks and the subject content was not to our taste."
"Very depressing the entire time, yes it's suspenseful and has a great cast, but there wasn't a silver lining or even the smallest joke."
This show has too much blood and killing!  I don't like the fact that the show is always going back to the past which creates confusion at times.
"I love Damien Lewis; he was awesome in Band of Brothers. But everything else I've seen him in since, has failed to win me over including this new show which I wanted to like. His character (who gets out of prison for a murder he didn't do after 12 years,)is a cop who is quirky and spouts zen phiolosophy to his gorgeous partner all day. Either you like the main characters 'quirky' personality and will get into the show; or you won't which is what I experienced.In addition the flash back storytelling style grew tiresome quickly; Robin Weigert as his Captain and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsome's Wife (Jennifer Siebold)both good actors, play very unlikable characters. In fact only Adam Arkin as Damien's ex-con financial advisor, is 'normal' and enjoyable to watch here. A big disappointment as a summer replacement show; get ""Burn Notice"" instead--it's great!l"
"I felt that the new show &#34;Life&#34; was interesting. The pilot episode offers some background on a cop that was wrongly convicted of a crime. He is released and after negotiating a multi million dollar settlement with the Police Deaprtment goes back to work as a detective in the Police Department. He has a very zen approach to life and is trying to solve the crime for which he was convicted. His partner is a young woman that is a recovering addict. She has little patience for him and is suspect of his methods.Still, I found that the show was not compelling. I think it went over the top and released too much information on the first episode when they should have held back a little. Everyone loves a good mystery!Dani Reese's (the woman agent) emotional responses were confusing. On one hand, she has little patience for her new partner ready to disclose everything he does wrong to her superiors and at the end of the episode, protecting him. She seems overly emotional in some scenes and then stoic in others. She is a recovering addict. I would have disclosed Dani Reese's addiction history maybe a bit later. The show just needs better writing.Damian Lewis played his character well, if he was going for the quirky Zen guy. But, the way he speaks (an attempt by the writers to make him interesting) is not that compelling. He has no censor and that's ok. But, the writer's attempt is so transparent as to make every line that comes out of Crews (the main character played by Lewis) unbelievable.Claudia Black is a good actress, why they would recast her is beyond me."
"If Katie Sackhoff had been hired to play Jamie Summers and if the writers had all been fired and replaced by people capable of actually writing good stories, intelligent characters and compelling stories this might have been a great show.  But she wasn't, they weren't and it most certainly was not.  I also sincerely wish Hollywood would stop casting pretty over talented or even suitable for the part.  Very disappointing."
"All the parts were there for a truly fine series.  Good actors awesome budget...  well ok maybe not all the parts.  The story lines while interesting were executed poorly and the special effects just didn't do justice to the show.  What really stuck out to me as unacceptable were the fight scenes.  Jamie Sommers routinely injured people by accident when she forgot her new ""strength"".  In the fight scenes she couldn't fight here way out of a wet paper bag.  One super punch and the guy gets up not even a bruise, no broken bones nothing.  When she gets hit in her non bionic parts pretty much the same thing.  She can take a punch better than ALI ever could.They say the writers strike condemned this show to one season.  I really doubt that.  I would not purchase a second season."
"With so much real quality television around, I suppose it's inevitable that some just don't quite make the grade.  And in an age when writing on television on TV is reaching such high standards, it's a shame that in the end it's the writing that lets this down.It's also worth remembering that if you plan to purchase this, it is only EIGHT episodes - yes, that includes the pilot.  So Jaime Sommers is in a car accident, gets her limbs, eye and ear replaced with superior bionic parts by a covert group who go around saving the world each week.  Hangers on include her younger sister who lives with her and knows nothing of her secret life, and later, a boyfriend.  And for character development, well, in 8 episodes, that's all we have time for, folks.  Think of it as Alias, with added bionics, minus any of the charisma.Acting is fine - Michelle Ryan hits the required notes of all American woman, and woman who you believe can throw a punch, but somehow never quite convinces of having the superior IQ of the character - again, mostly the writing and not her fault.  Miguel Ferrer is the boss, to add Hollywood clout.  Let's face it though, If Miguel Ferrer is who you turn to to add clout.. well. Need I say more.  One of the highlights is a story arc with Isaiah Washington who turns out to be the most believable character in the series, and a delicious cameo over several episodes with Katee Sackhoff, from Battlestar Galactica.  Since the producer of this series also brought that series to the screen, it is especially disappointing that it is on story and writing that this series stumbles.So we have a fairly hum drum series which relies completely on its high concept, and lacks pazazz.  All the same, it's worth remembering that 10 years ago this would have been a welcome addition to the TV schedule... it's not a bad series - it just has such strong competition these days, that why wade through sloppy scripting and lazy character exposition?"
Where's the humor?  I get this is a popular show and several people told me they liked it but it totally fell flat for me.  I suffered through one episode and then tossed the DVD into a black hole.  HUMOR: D minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus; OVERALL GRADE: D plus to C minus; WHEN WATCHED: 02/08/2011.
"If ""House"" had an actor of lesser talent than Hugh Laurie, it would have been off the air after season 2.  By season 3, the shows were becoming formulaic and themes were being recycled.  Unfortunately, the solution was not to fire the writers but to back-burner the primary actors.If the writers and producers had a bit more imagination and courage, they've got great characters and situations they could mine more deeply; instead, they chicken-out, content to skim the surface.Season 4 pushes the viewer's willing suspension of disbelief past the breaking point.  Chase, an intensivist, becomes a skilled surgeon and Cameron, an immunologist, becomes a senior ER attending?  Really?  And they still want to work at the same hospital as House?  Really?And then there's the ridiculous ""reality TV"" style interviews to replace House's team.  Sure, it fits with House's love of games, but really?And, finally, while House nearly lost his friends, job, and freedom for Vicodin in Season 3, his Vicodin addiction seems to have virtually disappeared in Season 4.  Really?Vote this season of House off the island.  It deserves NO IMMUNITY."
"First off, I've enjoyed most vampire TV shows over the last two decades, and they've all had some things in common, and they've all had some differences. Most of them steal from the original (Bram Stoker) and all of them have liberally stolen from each other and from literary sources (such as Anne Rice) because vampire canon, such as it is, was limited by the original Stoker Dracula and re-invented imaginatively by Anne Rice. I loved, loved, LOVED Buffy The Vampire Slayer (the TV show, not the movie) because it was such an amazing dramatic TV show, as was its spin-off Angel.That said, I disagree with most reviewers who've said Moonlight is a rip-off of Buffy or Angel. It is not. The only supernatural beings on Moonlight are the vampires, not the pantheon of assorted trolls, demons, and other evil beings from other dimensions and portals that Buffy and Angel and the Scooby gang so frequently encountered and defeated. Also, the only evils on Moonlight are committed by humans -- and occasionally vampires.So far the vamp TV show Moonlight most closely resembles is Forever Knight, the short-lived (3 seasons) CBS ""Crime Time After Prime Time"" early 90s late night show set and shot in Toronto. Mick St. John on Moonlight is not unlike Nick Knight on Forever Knight, in terms of his longing to be human and his angst about the ""monster"" he perceives himself to be.Both shows featured the main character in triangulated relationships which provide conveniently built-in emotional tension for character and relationship development, plot devices, and historical flashbacks/backstory. Both shows featured the main male vampire character dancing around his attraction to a beautiful human woman, with both of them knowing that the relationship could never be consummated without danger, death, or some other terrible outcome (the human being ""turned"" vampire and condemned to a life of darkness and undeath); thus the two are therefore locked in a perpetual state of unresolved sexual tension packed with opportunities for jealous interference in each other's lives (plot device), and only half-heartedly able to pursue romantic attachments with truly available partners of the same, er, species (living or undead) (also plot devices). And, like Nick Knight, Mick St. John prefers not to drink (eat) humans -- but where Nick Knight made do with cow blood, Mick St. John subsists on human donor blood. Moonlight, in those respects, is formulaically quite similar to Forever Knight. (After this point, there are SPOILERS, so you may want to stop reading now...)However, there are some clever differences: Forever Knight's big, bad sire vampire LaCroix, who used female vampire protege Janette to lure Nick into accepting his ""gift"" of eternal life (and provided and amplified the delightful homoeroticism of the mentor/protege possessor/possessed relationship) has been replaced by Coraline. Coraline is Mick St. John's ex-wife and sire on Moonlight -- an apparently evil female vampire who'd lived some 500 years, sired Mick (made him a vampire) on their wedding night (in 1952), and enmeshed him in an obsessive, addictive relationship from which he tried to break free many times but usually couldn't. He never wanted to be a vampire -- he didn't even know she was one when they married. She made him a vampire against his will, without asking him or getting his permission. Now, of course, he has ""trust issues."" She, from her perspective, gave him a ""gift"" of eternal life -- freedom from death (sounds familiar -- like LaCroix on Forever Knight!).Coraline crossed a fatal line, however, when she kidnapped a human girl to make their couplehood a little ""family"" (sounds familiar, eh? rather like Lestat, Louis, and Claudia in Anne Rice's Interview With The Vampire). Mick, by this time (1982), was using his vampire skills to do good as a private detective (it is implied, though not directly stated, that he ""does good"" as a PI because he feels guilty about the ""bad"" he's done as a vampire). It was in this capacity that the girl's mother approached him to find her daughter Beth -- only for Mick to discover that it was his wife Coraline who kidnapped the innocent child in a demented ploy to win him back.Another re-invention on Moonlight is that wooden stakes don't kill vampires, they just paralyze them. Only beheading and fire kill vampires in the Moonlight universe. Mick, in his PI role in the first episode, finds the distraught mother's little girl, rescues her, stakes his crazy ex-wife/lover/sire Coraline to paralyze her, and sets the place on fire before locking her in. The little girl he rescues is returned intact to her family. Thus begins Mick's distant ""relationship"" with Beth Turner, who grows up to be a reporter for BuzzWire, a mostly online magazine that's not unlike the tabloid Courtney Cox's character Lucy edits on FX's show Dirt, except it's less celebrity-focused and more local crime story sensationalism. Mick keeps an eye on Beth from afar until a new case in 2007 LA causes their paths to cross again.In the first episode of Moonlight, ""No Such Thing as Vampires,"" Beth, now grown into a beautiful blond with journalistic ambitions (but news-whore tendencies), winds up working with Mick to track down what may or may not be a vampire killer so she can score a big win with her editor and online readers. Mick works with her so he can both protect her and eliminate this threat to the secret existence of vampires in LA (with strong encouragement from his amoral vampire friend Josef, a 400-some year old vamp played by Jason Dohring, formerly on Veronica Mars).I didn't watch this episode on CBS. In fact, I didn't watch the first 6 episodes of Moonlight on TV at all -- I watched them on CBS' web site of full video, Innertube. I was intrigued by Alex O'Loughlin's eye-candy good looks, I've always loved the vampire genre, and I dearly loved Jason Dohring's dysfunctional portrayal of Logan Echolls on Veronica Mars, so I knew I wanted to catch the show. But I wasn't about to be seduced by a show that had already had so many rumors of troubled production and bad writing. The first episode was as predicted: stilted dialogue, cliche-ish plot devices, utterly predictable plot and twists.However, what keeps me watching the show are several things: (1) the show has a beautiful, SoCal corrupt clarity about it, a noir look that is dark, decadent, sexy, and shiny; (2) Alex O'Loughlin just takes over the screen when he's on it because he's got screen presence and, despite the poor material, seems to have a fairly nuanced set of acting skills, including tiny facial movements and slight changes in body position/language, which communicate volumes; (3) Jason Dohring, who provides major competition for O'Loughlin when they share the screen, and plays his amoral, jaded vampire role to the hilt, practically eating up the scenery, and (4) Sophia Myles, who had actual vamp cred prior to Moonlight (in the first Underworld movie) and is herself not a bad piece of eye-candy of the female persuasion, and has some chemistry with O'Loughlin. She also isn't your typical stick-thin, anorexic-looking TV actress; the girl's got a little meat on her bones. So, unlike many of the women on TV, she actually occasionally looks like a ""real"" woman. Finally, (5) the show manages to have a sense of humor and sarcasm about the city it's set in -- LA -- and the surface-obsessed tendencies of the majority of the people and the business that keep it going.The first episode, however, was straight out of B-movie (or is that B-TV) hell. I thought, ""Eh, that was was pretty; I'll watch the next ep on the web and see if it gets any better."" I mainly knew I would come back for Jason Dohring and because O'Loughlin is pretty enough to keep me coming back, too. But I wasn't expecting much from the show based on the first episode. I figured it would be my guilty pleasure, something I'd watch as ""webisodes"" and not much else.Surprisingly, it's getting really good. This has a lot to do with improved writing, developing backstory, intersecting relationship triangles, and the growing role of Shannyn Sossamon as Mick's ex-wife and vampire sire Coraline. It's still eye candy, but I don't feel as guilty about watching it -- and now I actually watch it on TV. I even got suckered into buying it via Amazon Unbox. I credit mostly Alex O'Loughlin and Jason Dohring with this. But the most recent episodes (we're up to episode 9 now) have ratcheted up the tension between Beth and Mick, while also increasing the tension between Mick's happily-amoral and happily-non-human friend Josef (Jason Dohring) and the unhappy, secretly self-hating Mick, who longs for a cure for his vampirism, some way to turn human again.Adding the seductive Coraline (Shannyn Sossamon) in flashbacks to fill out the story of how Mick ""went to bed a happily married man and woke up a monster"" has only improved the show's ""grab"" factor. The chemistry between Alex O'Loughlin and Sophia Myles is a nice slow burn, but it truly sizzles with Shannyn Sossamon. And there's a nice metrosexual homoerotic chemistry with Jason Dohring as well. There are some very sexy (though still network-TV-permissible) scenes on later eps and I'm looking forward to upcoming episodes.Make no mistake: like Angel, Buffy -- and Forever Knight before them, as well as movies like Interview with the Vampire and 30 Days Of Night -- what makes Moonlight, and all vampire TV shows and movies entertaining is not necessarily the vampires. It's that their vampirism allows for extremes of behavior and emotion that dramatize the joys and horrors of being human, and provide a starker backdrop for portraying the sometimes excruciating choices we must make between the lesser of two (or three or four) evils, or when emotion overrules reason in our decision-making. They're still vampire shows, and that will result in some people dismissing them outright -- just as some people dismiss science fiction as not ""serious"" literature. But as Battlestar Galactica fans know, it's not the genre that defines the shows, it's the characters and what they do in the extreme situations they're thrown into that makes for compelling television.From that perspective, this early episode of Moonlight is not compelling at all, and neither is the second. But the show is coming along, it is definitely coming along.Watch this first episode, ""No Such Thing As Vampires,"" and the second Moonlight episode, as the contrived set-ups they are for the seven following (more entertaining and less contrived) episodes."
"While the first two seasons were very successful, the third season is awful. THe idea of changing the format slightly is understandable and the creators were probably aftaid of getting in a rut. The problem is that the show was really very good. Until, at first Earls goes to prison, during which time he stops crossing things off his list and then he goes into a coma and it gets worse, a lot worse. Also, while previously the storylines were funny now the want to shock also slightly and the whole concept does not work anymore really."
"The reboot of Battlestar Galactica was ultimately a failure.  It is most unfortunate because the elements of greatness were there.  The overarching story was a good one and I was interesting in individual plot lines throughout.  The chief problem was characterization.More and more often as the series progressed, characters were written to do things both against their previous nature and against all common sense.  Both of the Adamas became simply laughable with over-acting the norm and erratic -- unbalanced? -- behavior expected.  I wouldn't trust Bill Adama to rearrange my silverware drawer, much less command a ship.  His always-to-excess drinking alone would have disqualified him from command, a trait shared by way too many of his crew.Mary McDonnell was the series best actor and I wanted to like Laura Roslin.  While a better leader than Bill Adama, she was also ultimately unworthy of my trust.  So, too, was I pulling for Kara Thrace and I really came to enjoy her portrayal by Katee Sackhoff.  Ultimately, I have no freaking idea who and what she was and could muster litter care.  And that was the problem in a nutshell with the series.I just ultimately didn't care whether or not they found earth or survived or lost to the Cylons.  The characters on balance were not very likable and were certainly unworthy of my admiration.  I said in another review of the series -- season 3? -- that the humans were so lacking in worthy quality that it might be better for humanity to be wiped away.  Ultimately, I think that the only character I really would have trusted was Athena and overall, I liked the Cylons more than the humans.  I realize that Ron Moore was trying to create a story where the lines were blurred as to which side should have been seen as the heroes and that is admirable.  It sadly just wasn't executed well.  When you simply stop caring about the characters and a need to finish what you started rather than a burning desire to know what happens in the story drives you forward episode-to-episode, you know a story has gone off the rails.I bet -- I even hope -- that the concept of Battlestar Galactic will be picked up again in a couple of decades.  There is a good story to be told.  It just wasn't this one."
"Good title, great cast with a sick story to tell. After reading several of the reviews, decided to watch this and evaluateSPOILER ALERT- If young male rape and its consequences is what you seek - then this is your movie! Perhaps if I read more reviews I may have picked up on that. Shoulda passed on this one."
"I gave this series two stars to be kind.  It has very little if any redeeming value to it.  Those that like to see borderline pornography may enjoy he series but I am not one of those people.  I am surprised that David Ducovny , who has played good roles would even consider this series.  Well if I say any more I would cease to be kind.Knight68"
"This weekend my wife and I tried watching First Season DVDs for 2 shows we missed out on when they first broadcast on TV -----  Californicaton and Mad Men.While Mad Men ended up being very impressive both in style and writing, Californication seemed to be nothing more than an attempt to get laughs and reactions thru shots of nudity, foul language and body function jokes.After 3 episodes it did not seem to get any better from our perspective, so we hit the EJECT button."
To much nudity and sex with a kid involved. Story lines are weak at best. You know he's going to lay the girl as soon as they meet no surprise there. The girls are pretty and built but a woman wouldn't really let her daughter be subjected to such a life. If you want T and A and lots of it watch the series. Other wise there are much better series to watch.
not good for your children to watch too much sex and bad words and bad plot it has no learning of any good habits
"My mom who is 79 years old, loves this show and so does the rest of my family. It makes me depressed. I think the differene is, that my mom has always lived in the cozyness of the middle class so all this is new to her and frankly very far removed from reality as she knows it. I have on the other hand lived in poor neighborhoods most of my adult life. I have seen metheads, crackheads, tweakers, junkies, you name it and dealers on daily basis, the havoc it rages on whole communities. I have lived with this violence and seen it with a completely sober mind.When you live in a place like that, the saying goes ""that these people are quite the characters, but have no character"". When you live with this you develope a strange mixed feeling of empathy and disgust for people in the drug culture. Sometimes you just become num. I remember one time, walking on my way home an involuntary thought struck my mind as I passed some crackheads smoking, to my shame it was ""human garbage"". I was instantly horrified of how desensitized I had become toward my fellow human beings. The hard part is, that you get to know these people personally the longer you live among them so they are not just some strangers anymore. You run into them all the time. The dealers are not without a respect altogether, because when a new one comes around they say ""No she's not like that, leave her alone"".  Sometimes they laugh cuz the new guy mistook a  ""strait"" person for a customer. However you always have to let them know you are cool so it's a better choise to let them know you a little, that you don't judge them, so they will trust you and leave you alone. Neighborhoods like that are very dangerous and you don't want enemies.I know all the scum bags, the little guys that are trying to make a buck selling dope, the corrupt cops, or more like the cops who are so sick of it, they don't want to deal with it. Sometimes they can't do anything because the jails are full. Seriously.  The sadness and ramifications meth brings are horrific. The ignored children. I have seen it all and some of the people in the show are quite real to me. I know all of these characters. I know for example, its supposed to be funny that they are cooking meth in the basement while the realtor is showing the house, but to me it's not funny at all because it's too linked to what I have seen in reality and its anything but funny. I think the 1st season was more than enough addition to my reality. I highly doubt that I will watch any more of it. Sorry mom, you and my niece can keep talking about it, I am not interested.I guess if I was a straight laced and pampered in a way where I've never lived with this kind of reality I would find this funny and interesting. But I haven't and I don't."
I never got into this series. I wasn't sure if this was a parody or a drama so I gave up on it.
"As promised, the acting, cinematography, and general production values are top notch.  But like the Sopranos, I find the content toxic and depressing.  There is already a pattern of a buildup of tension and a narrow escape.  This chemistry teacher is going to have to come up with more complicated strategies to pull off this double life.  But he seems to have a sociopathic disregard for the lives he's destroying even as his own body is wasting away.  I'm simply not up for 40 more hours of covert drug manufacturers."
"In the not too distant future where George Bush has somehow fluked his way into another term as president, a chemo-virus has broken out in a small town. The Z-Squad is sent in to eliminate the problem, but a member of the squad gets infected and flees. He manages to to find refuge in an underground strip club, which has also been deemed illegal by the government of the future. The soldier takes a turn for the worse and finds himself a member of the undead only to take the club's biggest star as his first victim. She continues to dance and the odd thing is...the customers love it. Zombie strippers are the new sex appeal. As the money piles up, so do the victims. Will the chemo-virus continue to spread and if so...how will it be contained?First of all, don't be confused. This is movie is one of the cheesiest films ever. I almost turned it off several times and I honestly can't tell you why I'm reviewing this thing. The sad thing is it's like a trainwreck in slow motion. You can't look away from it once you start watching and you have to see not only how it's going to end, but who's going to make it out alive. Not that you really care, but you wonder whose really deemed worthy of surviving said trainwreck. It is ludicrous, ridiculous, and absurd...but it's amusing as hell.How ridiculous is it? Let's see...strippers being turned into zombies and becoming super strippers, zombies being sexy, having the most stereotypical Mexican janitor...ever, the casts biggest names being Jenna Jameson and Robert Englund, special effects you'd find in Xena: Warrior Princess, a Christian stripping for her nanna, Jenna Jameson shooting ping pong balls and pool balls out her...well...I'll let you see that for yourself, angry dragons, and foamy chewbaccas...the list goes on and on. I'm sure I missed so many more. The sad thing is that despite being the cheesiest of cheese and being as bad as it is, there's still a few good things buried under the cheese. It's kind of like an enchilada made with cheap cheese. All the cheap stuff is on the outside, but there's some good stuff on the inside. The most obvious being that there's a lot of nudity in this, which is good because it'll probably be one of the only things that'll keep anyone watching. Robert Englund's over the top performance as the germophobic strip club owner is pretty memorable. Also, the make-up effects are surprisingly good at times. The special effects are horrid, but the make-up is actually better than you think it'd be.In a film as ridiculously cheesy as this, I can't blame anyone if they turn it off before it reaches the half hour mark. The thing is though if you stick with it, it's actually enjoyable because it's so bad. It's cheesy, it's amusing, the acting is so bad that you'll be quoting it for days, the plot is pointless, and it even has a weak attempt at a twist in the ending! My point is that it's a bad film and I'm not defending it, but if you manage to sit through the whole thing...you may find yourself enjoying parts of it like I did.Rating: 4/10(most people will probably rate it a 1/10...if that)"
"Zombie Strippers(released April/08)stars one of my fave actors,Robert Englund(forever Freddie Krueger in my heart),as the only real star amongst this  company of amateurs and up and comers.It has been my misfortune of late,if you have seen any of my recent reviews,to be watching movies lately with less than stellar value,shall we say.Add yet another one to that list.*sigh* What I thought would be a low budget indie film,with some real kick to it,turns out to just....a low budget indie film.The jokes and situations are totally lame,old and stereotypical.To give you an idea and a good example of the latter,a Mexican janitor is loading up his gun and with each bullet he carefully puts in the chamber he utters""Pancho Villa....Montezuma...Caesar Chavez...Cinco de Mayo...guacamole..."".Yeah,funny,funny stuff,right? Mr.Englund does a fine job as the owner of the strip club,who is deathly afraid of catching ""something"" off of one of his girls and just loves his money.The strippers themselves I thought also did a pretty good job but the ""comic relief"",such as it is,comes in the form of the opening act,the hippest but dumbest and street wise bunch of Marines you have ever seen.None of them had the acting chops to pull off a send up like theirs,even if they had tried...oh yeah,they were trying.Sorry guys.The plot finds a laboratory become infested with zombies.The marines are called in to eradicate them.They do their job,but in the process one gets bitten and flees the building through a basement window(great security).That Marine in turn heads into a nearby strip club and infects one of the dancers.That dancer/stripper infects another dancer/stripper,and so on and so on.Before you know it the ones uninfected WANT to become infected,as the infected ones are getting all the attention from the male patrons.And oh yes,the strippers,after their dances,each take a patron into the back and proceed to eat them.The remains,either heads,bodies without heads,bodies with heads,etc.,usually re-animate and they lock them in jail-like cells in the basement.Doesn't every strip club you know have jail cells?Owner Englund at first is beside himself with what is happening,but before you can say ""bite me"",he sees dollar signs.The strippers are soon competing with one another and Englund is raking in the dough.Somewhere along the line,the Marine major/leader finds out about the zombies at the club(he overhears a convo while reading a newspaper outside!).Meanwhile one of the stripper zombies has gone down into the basement and voluntarily let the incarcerated ones bite and infect her.She also lets all of them out and they go a-wandering around the club.The Marines come to the rescue and exterminate the zombie menace.Poor Englund gets bitten and is to be taken back to the labs for testing.The Marines also find one of the lab personel in the club trying to pick a lock(?).He fesses that it was he who deliberately spread the zombie virus throughout the lab.He said there's alot of money to be had in ""working for the man"".The Marines leave going to do...whatever they usually do,and the lab man has two of his unbitten cohorts come in to clean up the strip club mess.For a low budget film,the special effects(heads being blown off,ripped apart,etc.)are on the whole not too shabby,as opposed to those in Alien Armegeddon,another indie cheapie.The demographic for a film like this would be male,18-25 yrs.,because there is ALOT of T&A; throughout the film,graphic at that(I think they called it nudity,once upon a time).It is this group that would probably love this film,for that alone.Males of ages before,shouldn't be viewing this at all and those after,will,for the most part,see the film for what it is....bad.The only other person to stand out to any extent was Carmit Levit&eacute; as the Russian Blavatski,who was directly in charge of the dancers.At first I thought her portrayal was a bit over the top,but as the movie progressed she seem to settle down and I actually didn't mind her performance at all.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and looks clear and crisp.Extras include two featurettes,deleted scenes & commentary.All in all,despite having star Robert Englund on board for this project,it is an amateurish and lame excuse for a film and it's satire,send ups and laughs fall flat.Mr.Englund does a good job,as do the strippers(for the most part)and their handler Levite',but it is not nearly enough to save this dud.Give it a wide pass."
"Pay close attention to the film's title. It is ""Zombie Strippers,"" not ""Zombies vs. Strippers."" Silly as it is, ""Zombie Strippers"" is the title of the film starring Jenna Jameson and Robert Englund because here strip dancers become zombies and they dance on stage before the crowd of cheering males in a strip club. I mean it. It is a one-joke movie, of which joke could have been turned into something much funnier than as it is, by someone like Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, creator team of ""Shaun of the Dead."" I only wish that they have directed the film.Jenna Jameson plays Kat, a strip dancer. Robert Englund is a greedy owner of the club, who is more than happy to see the audiences excited over the un-dead dancers (whose dancing gets sexier as the film goes on) even though some of the ""lucky"" males haven't returned from the backstage.The situation is absurd, but I think it is exactly the point. Unfortunately we need someone who can turn absurdity into comedy here. ""Zombie Strippers"" suffers slack direction, especially its earlier part where Robert Englund does not appear. Clearly Robert Englund is having a good time, and watching him as the sleazy (and cowardly) owner is fun, but the film is only sporadically funny with too scanty supply of jokes or ideas.""Zombie Strippers"" is a comedy in which Robert Englund's club owner is named ""Ian Essko"" and his club ""Rhino."" I confess I didn't at first get the joke playing on the name of the playwright Ionesco and one of his plays, and I still don't know why it has to be named like that. I was impressed more with ""ping-pong tricks."" I want more of them."
There should have been some indication that the movie is in Spanish. ..very hard to follow. Hate subtitles. It's tough trying to read and watch a movie at the same time. Didn't like it at all.
Mindless show.  Truly wasting your time.  Not funny and nothing to learn from.  Don't let your kids watch this show.
"I am a fan of Tobe Hooper who directed the original ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" and ""Poltergeist"" but this episode does not live up to his reputation.  The story is blurry, unoriginal and not scary at all. It is a tale that has been told many times before.  An angry demon of the earth, this time oil under the earth, enters the body of a father and the son witnesses his father brutally kill his mother.  Now years later it's time for the evil spirit to inhabit the son's body and cause mayhem and destruction throughout the town he lives in. The story has no real clarity, and there is a no suspense or thrills just mass confusion in the film and outside the film as a viewer.  It looks like it was just thrown together at the last minute.  If you want some originality and horror watch Hooper's Season 1 contribution called ""Dance of the Dead"" and save yourself some time and money here."
"Half an hour into the series I was bored out of my mind. The premise of the show revolves around 2 U.S. Marshalls that work for the Witness Protection Program. The dialogue is forced, the voiceover is annoying, the domestic squabbles are comedic at best. Marshall Mann has zero personality. Bobby D (Todd Williams) is probably the best and only good thing in this show."
"honestly the costume is really cook looking for the time period this was made in.The flash is one of my favorite super hero's ever since my nickname was Flash when I did track, so learning a little bit about him was cool but I really couldn't sit for so long through these episodes like 40-60mins each?the only way to watch this and stay sane is to skip threw a lot of parts, there is just too much story, if they re-made this into a tv series now a days and made it like the arrow, I would prolly love it if they made it, if they re-make this now a days I would love to watch it even at 2 hours an episode lolafter seeing how awesome arrow was, I never knew arrow before but once I started watching the tv show wow he is actually awesome, the story behind how he got accuracy and everything is awesome and he's not one of my favorite, im even thinking about buying some green arrow comic books just to see more about how cool he is now. Flash I already got a lot of comics of him lol. but really looking forward to seeing a re-make of this in years to come"
"Season 4 was almost as bad as Season 1 was good.  I could easily write a 10 page review detailing the various issues I took exception with, but I will suffice with a complaint list.1. The plethora of plot twists.  Even M. Night Shayamalan would've said enough's enough.2. Bringing people back to life.  I know that they were never confirmed dead, but they were dead enough.  I thought Prison Break was making a bid to be a soap opera.3. The various coalitions.  How many bad guys can you work with just because ""you need them.""4. The sloppiness of The Company.  Whereas the General wouldn't even say a word in season 2, by season 4 he was a chatty kathy.  He was equally careless with who he killed and how.5. The slipperiness of T-Bag.  T-Bag left almost as many dead bodies in his wake as did The Company but by the end of the show I knew one thing: if a nuclear bomb went off the only survivors would be cockroaches and T-Bag.  He had more lives than a cat and the uncanny ability of always having just enough information to keep himself alive.6. The Scofield boyscout act.  In season 1 and 2 Scofield's reluctance to kill was an endearing quality.  It made you realize that he was no real criminal, he was only in his position due to trying to help his brother.  By season 4 I was sick of the ""I won't kill"" act although he repeatedly faced immenent danger.  Ultimately, that left others to do the killing for him or him accidentally killing people (i.e. the man he hit with a piece of wood then fell and cracked his skull).  The only time Scofield actually pulled a trigger... surprise the gun wasn't loaded.  Heck, Sarah killed more people than Scofield did.7. The resilient bodies.  I finally began to tire of the amazing faces and bodies of the cast.  I don't mean amazing as in stunningly good looking, but as in their abilities to heal so quickly.  Normally I afford a show a lot of leeway when it comes to suspended belief: manhole covers that weigh five pounds, concrete that easily crumbles, abilities to run long distances at top speed, etc.  But, I guess once a show starts to go south every annoyance is amplified.  From the beatings, stabbings, shootings and other abuse Scofield, Burrows, T-Bag, Bellick and Sucre took, they should still be hospitalized.  Scofield didn't even have a visible scar from getting his brain tumor removed.  Their abilities to take beatings and survive and make a full recovery free of any scars or lasting disabilities became unbearable.8. My indifference.  In season 1 I was at the edge of my seat.  I was holding my breath with every close call.  I was exhaling with every escape.  I was enthralled by Scofield's detailed planning.  I was even quite torn up when Lincoln was taken to the electric chair.  All of those emotions and feelings were dulled by season 4.  I was no longer at the edge of my seat, I was no longer exasperated by their capture or thrilled with each triumph.  And that was the single greatest disappointment of season 4.  Each scenario was one that had been played many times before in a different format yet the outcome was always the same.The show lost its umph and lost its luster.  There was a severe lack of imagination and hence a sharp drop in quality.  It seemed like actions of Scofield and The Company were directly proportional to the writing.  As the writing got sloppier, so did Scofield and The Company.  It just sucked to see the show flame out the way it did.  Even the ending was anti-climactic.  The show would have been better off ending at episode 12.  But, being honest about the entire show: how sustainable can a show called ""Prison Break"" be?"
"The third season of ""Heroes"" was a complete mess.  The season started off in a fairly strong manner, with the heroes targeted by the government and having to work together to escape.  However, this compelling idea was abandoned after a few episodes, with the heroes once again scattering all over the globe with separate (and uninspiring) plotlines.  What the producers and writers consistently fail to understand is that the fans of the show enjoy seeing the heroes work together, and not in the same predictable pairings (Ando & Hiro, Peter & Nathan, etc.).  By the end of the season, I really had no idea what the main plotline was and why I should care about any of it.""Heroes"" started as a fresh, clever series filled with interesting characters, and the producers showed a willingness to add new characters to help prevent things from getting stale.  Unfortunately, the producers and writers really lost the thread by the third season, stubbornly sticking with the same cast of heroes, long past their expiration date.  Particularly frustrating was their stubborn insistence on focusing on Sylar as the main villian; I enjoyed Sylar during the first two seasons but having a nearly unbeatable foe makes the rest of the cast look weak.  Instead of introducing new heroes, each week brought new alliances between the heroes that quickly dissolved before they really could be explored.  One week Noah and Sylar are working together, then they're enemies; the next week Nathan and Peter have reunited, then they're enemies; shampoo, rinse, and repeat.  Keeping up with these shifting alliances was dizzying and tiresome.  Likewise, all pretences of continuity have been abandoned in favor of ending each episode with a ""shocking"" conclusion.I'll watch at least the first few episodes of Season 4 of ""Heroes,"" as I feel a certain obligation given the time I've already invested in the series.  Also, I do still care a bit about a few of the characters, despite being jerked around by the inconsistent writing of the series.  However, I find that I can no longer recommend the series as a whole to new watchers, which is something I did prior to this season."
"The life has really gone out of this show by the second season.  Typical cop drama by the second season, even the Zen angle for the main character is gone."
"The stories are all still great, but they added a love interest for the partner and he killed any and all momentum the show had.  He had to have known someone to get the part because he didn't fit in in anyway with the flow of the show or the rest of the cast."
"This could have been a great show. But its not. What we get is a bunch of bikers presented as the defenders of small-town America. They get to be ""bad"" guys, but bad guys within real strict limits. Its another biker fantasy for rich guys in the suburbs. To undermine the premise even further they create real ""bad guys"" in the form of a white sumpremist gang hanging around the edges of things doing everything the ""good"" Bikers can't do.The show is also heavy on disfunctional family stuff taken right from the Sopranos. We have Jax Teller whose murdereded father apparently formed the gang as a utopian hippie experiment and would never have approved of the club running guns to make money. Jax spends half of every episode pouting about something. He just comes across as a total wuss.Ron Perlman has the presence to play the leader of the gang. But whatever presence he has is constantly undermined by Jax and the fact that every idea he has seems to fail or backfire. The show is at its best when Perlman is taking care of business for the club and showing how a small town like Charming works. Its at its worst whenever Jax gets whiny and they bitch at each other.Shows like this are good when everything is in shades of grey. When they show why someone like Clay makes the decisions he does and why idealism usually leads to trouble. But in Sons of Anarchy, Jax is always right and even if he takes a risk, it always pays off.One of the good things in the show are the law enforcement characters. There is far more realism in the show about them than the bikers.I really wanted to like this. And there were some things that I did really like. But the show is too tame and too much into biker fantasy."
"the plot is implausible, the characters unlikable, and the acting terrible. I've tried to watch this show, but it ain't no Breaking Bad nor is it the Sopranos. I think the viewer is supposed to be rooting for the SOA, but actually I just want all of them to go to jail for a very long time and take Gemma, the doctor, and all the other girlfriends and wives with them. Every episode repeats itself. The SOA do something wrong, the police suspect they are involved, it looks they are going to get caught, but then the police do something stupid and the SOA do something clever, and in the end they get away with whatever heinous criminal act they've committed. It is the same for the next episode and the next and the next. Oh and often there is a shoot out between the SOA and another biker group, but every time no one from the SOA gets away unscathed and someone from the other group gets killed. Wow! The police and the FBI/ATF are so incompetent or corrupt that it sometimes feels like I'm watching a comedy. I've made it over halfway through the first season and really questioning whether I should continue. Does this show actually get better? Why all the rave reviews?"
"soap opera... like anyone needs that?  I didnt care for soaps when my sister was glued to them and I had to watch. I dont care what you put the people in, a leather jacket and motorcycles even cant make that cool. Katy is always awesome though so she save me from giving it a one star!"
"Not having any prior knowledge of Watchmen I thought this would be fun to watch.  The ""motion comic"" concept is cool and i liked it all the way up to the part where the women speak.  Apparently they only have one narrator.  Multiple narrators would make this much better."
"I love good caper shows, but the casting is almost a total disaster. Timothy Hutton, the black guy and the blond girl are not terribly engaging, likeable or compelling. The black guy, in particular, is utterly unconvincing as the stereotypical black computer superwhiz, and utterly annoying and bland otherwise, sleepwalking through the series. Timothy Hutton has a grandma vibe. But the tough guy is a good pick.I realize dissenting reviews of TV series are the kiss of death for a reviewer, but I have to be honest."
Actuallly didn't finish watching it. Was not engaging enough. Slow moving and the romantic appeal was not evident well into the movie.
"Buy the first 4 seasons, rent the 5th season.  Not very good -- terrible scripts."
I like Tim Roth as an actor but in this series his character is not as engaging as it should be for someone of his talents. There is nothing to connect on the human level - no warmth or even cold humor.
I've seen a lot of the documentary footage before in other works.  That part plus the fabulous interviews I loved.  But it was impossible to watch because the camera technique is to jerk the camera around so much that it's hard on the eyes.
Stopped 15 minutes into the movie.  This movie wasn't so bad as it was irratating. The quips from the Satellite of Love crew didn't make up for it.  There is a vast differance between a bad movie and a bad movie that is worthy of the MST treatment.
"Mystery Science Theater 3000 is always great for a laugh, but in this case the underlying film &#34;Laserblast&#34; is neither good, nor &#34;so bad it's worth a watch.&#34;"
"Not the worst movie, But it is very slow and boring. Lena Headey is a great actress, too bad the movie was boring and slow.  You figure out the movie way to early. OK video and audio."
"First, Eliza Dushku is not, by any standards, a very good actress (although gorgeous). Her appearances in the Buffy and Angel universe, playing a great character (Fatih), was always a little bit embarassing when she was confronted with the better actors around her (Sarah Michelle, Boreanaz, James Masters, Anthony Stewart Head, Alyson Hannigan).Then, the show itself. Whedon fans will think everything he does is marvellous. But simply it is not. In this first season, there are some episodes that border on unwatchable (my favorite ""worst"" is episode number 7, ""Echoes"". Its 49 minutes seemes like two hours). The concept of the show itself is strange: basically, all characters are despicable. Even Echo's handler is evil. Why? Because everyone in his right mine must be intrinsically evil to work in a comapny like the Dollhouse. Heck, the Dollhouse business makes even Wolfram & Hart seem like children playing...The genius guy, Topher, the handlers, Adelle (who coldly puts people in the Attic), everybody is obnoxious just for working for that kind of corporation. And that's exactly what FBI agent Paul Ballard, theoretically the strongest moral person of the show, believes but, tcham tcham tcham!! For the sake of shocking plot twist, and nothing more than that, he begins to work for the Dollhouse ath the end of the season...Also, we have all the usual Whedon trademark talking, trademark alternative rock songs at the end of each episode, trademark photography, etc.. After some time, this gets boring.How this show survived its first season is a miracle."
"I was extremely disappointed by ""The Great Buck Howard"".The Great Buck Howard (John Malkovich) is a stage performer way past his prime.  A mentalist, he bounds up on stage and proceeds to astound his audience with mind reading, hypnotism and other mental games. The only problem is that he now plays broken down theaters in places like Bakersfield and Fresno and his audience, while still very enthusiastic, is aging and dwindling. In his heyday, he appeared on ""The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson"" sixty three times, a fact he mentions repeatedly, and Carson was so taken by the performer that he called him The Great Buck Howard, a title he has determinedly kept ever since. Preparing for his big comeback, his business manager (Ricky Jay) sets up a meeting with a potential Tour Manager. Troy Gable (Colin Hanks, son of Tom) has just dropped out of Law School and moved to LA to become a writer. But reality quickly settles in and he realizes he needs a job to pay the bills, so he interviews to work with Buck. He gets the job and heads out with the performer, making sure Buck's every request is filled, that the venues have everything set up, stagehands are ready to go, and the like. The problem is that Buck still thinks he is a huge star and expects the venues to treat him as such. Buck is very bitter that Jay Leno has never had him on his new ""The Tonight Show"" and plans a big stunt, guaranteed to kick-start his comeback. He decides Cincinnati is the place and asks his management company to send a publicist. Valerie Brennan (Emily Blunt, ""Sunshine Cleaning"", ""The Devil Wears Prada"") shows up and begins to set everything in place. But she is bemused by Buck and attracted to Troy and her presence causes things to begin to fall apart.Written and directed by Sean McGinly, ""The Great Buck Howard"" misses a very key element to make the film successful and memorable. It lacks the right tone.John Malkovich is interesting as the fading star who feeds on his self-perceived fame and glory. Buck trots out on stage at every venue and shouts, ""I love this town,"" and he really seems to mean it. He plays in aging theaters and is barely able to fill them with his aging audience. But they also seem to genuinely enjoy his show. Buck enjoys performing and seems to eke a living out of it and we can't fault him for this.But Buck Howard is not very funny. We have seen this type of character before. Many times. And many of these performances have been more insightful, more daring and more interesting.For ""Buck Howard"" to work, we need to realize the character knows his career is fading. He doesn't seem to. He enjoys the shows so much, you get the feeling he could perform for one person and he would be having fun. In fact, much of the time, he seems to be trying to make Troy's life more difficult simply to have something to do and maintain his 'great' status.But Malkovich never portrays Howard as being self-aware. If Buck never has any doubt about his ability or standing, are we supposed to either laugh at or with, or feel empathy towards him? He isn't desperate enough and enjoys what he does, even on a smaller scale, too much.Colin Hanks is OK, but he spends most of the time standing to one side, observing everything.Its difficult to tell what Troy is thinking or feeling because Hanks rarely changes his expression. The only clues we seem to get come from his narration. And his narration never seems to stop, rambling on and on. Film is a visual medium, a visual art form, so hearing consistent narration throughout a movie is the equivalent of trying to read a book and having someone consistently shove a DVD player in your face to watch video of what you are reading. Narration is useful and necessary in some instances. It isn't necessary to provide an ongoing commentary about what characters are feeling on screen, when we can't tell this visually. At least it shouldn't be necessary.I can recall two recent examples of narration in film, both bad. In ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"", Woody Allen uses an omniscient (and ever present) narrator to tell us the feelings, thoughts, likes and dislikes of the characters we are watching on screen. It quickly grates on the viewer's nerves. Worse, the narrator isn't even a character in the story. It's like he is reading us a story as we are trying to watch the same fable unfold before our eyes. The narration in ""Buck Howard"" seems designed for a different purpose. In many low budget, independent films, a narrator provides a useful tool. They tell us about things, bridging the gap in the stories, saving the filmmakers some money and allowing the story to proceed. I generally overlook this, because it isn't quite so obtrusive into the experience and it often helps enhance the film. In ""Buck Howard"", I get the sense the narration is designed for the same reasons, to help show things they couldn't afford to film, but Hank's descriptions go beyond this. They start to describe what he and other characters are feeling, thinking, want to do and accomplish. Why aren't we seeing this in the characters themselves? Why do we have to be told this?Hanks is not a very magnetic force in the film. He stands to the side a lot, observing, watching, rarely speaking. When he does, he always seems kind of flat, as though he can't muster up the energy to feel any real emotions. I can't help but think how much different his father's career would have been had he done similar work in the beginning of his career.When Emily Blunt's Valeria shows up, Troy becomes a little more energetic as they begin a romantic relationship. Troy actually smiles a few times and seems to enjoy the companionship.Emily Blunt provides a little bit of fresh air. Valerie arrives in town to help Buck navigate the press corps for his big presentation. From New York, it quickly becomes clear Valerie comes from a different world. She moves faster, registers faster, reacts faster than the people in Cincinnati and seems like a little tornado whirling through the town. As soon as she meets Troy, she begins to flirt with him (she must see something we don't) and he picks up on it, relishing the new relationship. At one point, Valerie can't help but laugh at one of Buck's statements, providing a little ray of sunshine among the group of people who are taking his every word so seriously.Steve Zahn and Debra Monk pop up as a brother and sister designated to be Buck's official hosts in Cincinnati. It is an amusing idea, but the roles don't really go anywhere and they end up simply disappearing.And there is an amusing ongoing joke about a feud between Buck and George Takei (Mr. Sulu on ""Star Trek). But even this leads to what should have been a memorable moment and this moment just falls flat. It almost seems like everyone is playing the scene straight.I suspect ""The Great Buck Howard"" will enjoy a lifetime in obscurity, much like the fictional subject of this forgettable comedy."
"You'll hear the phrase ""Total Package"" so many times that you'll become immune to it.  The fact that it's being used in relation to a child doesn't seem to bother either the parents or the pageant coordinators.From the get go, it's obvious to everyone but the parents that the pageants are a scam.  Everyone ""wins"" or ""places.""  The crowning system is some bizarre set of rules where no one really goes home a loser but where the ""Queen"" of each ""division"" is also not a winner.  There's a set of ""supreme"" crowns and a grouping of ""Ultimate"" crowns which is the ""winner"" of the entire pageant.  Oh, whatever. It sounds like a set of prizes a couple of five year olds made up.You can't really compete in a full ""Glitz"" pageant unless you have a ""cupcake"" dress,  the proper hair pieces, full make up, a fake spray on tan,  glamour and retouched photos and other accouterments but your total prize will more than likely be only $1000.  Never mind that the cost of preparing for a pageant will more than likely run you more than $5000 and lots of prep time.The pageants reward and judge on beauty as it's the only area that cannot be dropped. Beauty is finite and transitory.  The parents are both turning their children into monsters and leaving their children with no usable skills once their children's beauty ages out. The most appalling thing here is hearing the parents justify the waste of time and excuse the emphasis on ""beauty.""Furthermore, the ""modeling"" routines these children are taught are both cartoonish and ghoulish.  It's a sick, incestuous training wherein coaches teach them the same ridiculous poses they used as children that in turn make the children look almost clownish on stage and no one stops it. The judges who I can only assume are idiots reward them for it.  I mean, who puts both their fists under their chin and shakes their head like an idiot and thinks it looks cute? Or worse, draws a heart around their face? No one and yet - every child does it.And then there's the age inappropriate clothing.  The less said here the better but these mothers really need to be hit upside the head with a large batch of common sense.And yet... you keep watching because just when you think you're going to stop watching, something worse comes along..."
Surprisingly enough this show did not hold the attention of my two little ones. If a show is dull they move on within 5 minutes...and that's what they did. I however love this show!
"Up until this episode I had not seen any of season 13 of South Park. To be honest I had kind of changed my perspective of South Park and apart from the odd chuckle, I was beginning to find the show less and less funny. I watched this episode with the hope that it would re-ignite my liking of the show and convince me to check out the full 12th season and what exists currently of season 13. Unfortunately, the episode titled ""Pinewood Derby"" simply didn't allow for that re-ignition of my liking and I'm sad to say I will not be jumping to the chance to watch the other season 13 episodes.The story focuses around what many South Park fans are constantly asking for; an episode that has Randy Marsh as the main protagonist. This episode focuses around Randy's passion for Stan to win the Pinewood Derby which they have yet to do in all the years it's run. In order to win, Randy steals a magnetic piece of the CERN super collider and conceals it in the car. They win the race and inadvertently discover warp speed which is picked up on by an alien criminal who holds earth hostage while Randy struggles to keep his secret while building a new car.I suppose a lot of what let this episode down was the absence of the other 3 boys. I have never really been a fan of the Randy Marsh character. He's good for a part in an episode, but it's been proven in the past that an episode focusing almost entirely on him simply doesn't work. The episode seems to fall flat in a number of ways. The humour didn't really get me and I only really laughed at the news report showing Randy stealing the part of the super collider, dressed as Princess Leia."
"I love southern gothic (like Cormac McCarthy's ""Suttree"") but this film is missing it's only crucial ingredient...truth.  The symbolism is very clumsy and the adults hopelessly stereotyped.  Like Bjork's ""Dancer In The Dark"" it had me and then it lost me in an ocean of self-indulgent bitterness."
"Not since MONSTER'S BALL have I seen a movie that made we want to conduct a nuclear strike on the Deep South and then hang myself.Since I've been to the south, I wonder if anyting coming out of Hollywood (or Sundance) can be trusted.  To filmmakers, the south isn't a region or a people or culture, but a genre that can only be pushed and mutated into exercises in human depravity and despair.  I'm sure there are people who live horrible lives...but that's everywhere.  And I really don't think another film about addictions, poor white trash, and rape is necessary.  Just me.The acting is good.  The film looks very professional.  The writing...well...life really sucks east of Aspen and Hollywood."
"I haven't really watched it very much, just enough to make sure it was appropriate for my 7 year old granddaughter.  She likes it very much and has watched other episodes on her mom's account."
"""The Mutant Chronicles"" plays like a bad SyFy movie original film. In the 28th century the world is ruled by four corporate entities and nations no longer exist. When two warring factions face off and accidently destroy the seal that keeps The Machine a device that ""creates"" mutant soldiers that feel no pain and only live to attack and kill, these mutant soldiers start overrunning the Earth forcing people to flee the planet. Brother Samuel (Ron Perlman)recruits war veterans Major ""Mitch"" Hunter (Thomas Jane)along with a team of other veterans to delivery a explosive device to the heart of The Machine. The only problem is that Hunter and his team must find the key that activates the ancient bomb which is located somewhere within The Machine itself.A low budget for a movie wouldn't matter if it were inspired unfortunately ""The Mutant Chronicles"" written by Philip Eisner and directed by Simon Hunter, the script and direction are amateurish at best. While the cast is fairly solid it's pretty clear to me that John Malkovich took his brief role in the film for the money (as I suspect everyone did along with the idea of shooting almost an entire movie without real sets). It seems like everyone here had good intentions but they were undermined by a poorly written script, direction that focuses on the look and feel of the movie but not the performances or even assembling capable action sequences.Perhaps the element of camp and the stilted dialogue was intentional or this is meant to be a corny backstep to a 1950's style of filmmaking. If that's the case, you might enjoy it. I didn't.The image quality pretty good.I'd suggest renting before buying to see if this appeals to you."
I thought the plots were weak and the &#34;humor&#34; was not very funny.  The actors did a good job but it didn't seem that they had much to work with.
"This is a very strange movie. It is an Independent film shot on a very small budget, the characters are ultra quirky marginals, and there's a sense of wonder if the two will actually get together or not, and what is really wrong with the 'woman', why can't she be in love? But then the whole thing has this strange porn thread that runs throughout the film. And the ending is just plain flat out painful with Tom Arnold as the creep out father of the century. Tom Arnold has now hit a home run in the creep category.The director, writer, and lead female is Marianna Palka. Jason Ritter (John Ritter's son) is the lead male actor. The film meanders back and forth between Marianna's apartment, the video store where Jason works, and Jason's car where he lives. In the opening montage, Marianna walks into the video store and goes sheepishly over to the erotica film section. She quickly chooses four movies. Jason tries to convince her that one choice was a bad one, and she should not take that movie. He leaves off renting her the fourth movie, she leaves with the three films. Jason then stalks her at her apartment building.The film is claustraphobic, the apartment is small, Jason over stays his welcome, the two end up just too close to eachother, the car where he sleeps is tiny. The only place that is somewhat open is the video store. Both of these characters have strange habits. She wears baggies over her hands to open the DVD's, she hates to have her hair washed, she collects trash in her apartment, and likes to act out forcing herself on Jason. Jason likes to tell people what movies to watch, he has a regular job but can't afford a place to live, he is creepy about peeking through windows and shower curtains, and following Marianna around.I had a very hard time believing these two characters. It was as if the director / screen writer was trying so hard to make them both seem strange, like outcasts, outsiders; but yet they were both somehow brilliant and deeply misunderstood. And then there was this annoying constant reference to pornography and Marianna's distaste for genitals, male and female. The fact that the two of them are attracted to eachother, well that was reasonable.Technically, there were some problems. The audio was absolutely awful, the music was way overboosted and the dialog was poorly recorded. This is a film that relys heavily on dialog to build the craziness of the two characters, sadly the dialog was frequently muddy. This was a simple shoot, very few locations or sets; the video store, the car, the apartment complex entrance, and the apartment. The director did not use framing to her advantage at all, Marianne changes fairly dramatically in this story; but yet she ends up in random frame positions. There were many jump cuts that were too abrupt. Moments where incredible detail and slow paced filming, butted up against a jump cut to a much later time. The film had a hard time developing a decent rhythm. One moment the camera is in the apartment, the next in Jason's car the next morning.The DVD includes a few trailers, oddly Confessions of a Porn Addict trailer is included. A gag reel that has the poorest sound recording I've ever heard. This is a not so funny 10 minute reel.At One hour and 25 minutes, the movie is a bit long. The ending beats a dead horse a bit too hard. The film is definately R rated and not at all for younger viewers. Oddly, there is virtually no nudity in the film. Everything that makes this film R is verbal.It just seemed to me that Marianna Palka tried to do too much with this film; write, direct, star in, and over play a not so bad love story. Just not a very well made film."
"We ejected this movie after 30 minutes when we first tried to watch it.Then we saw the mostly favorable reviews here on  AMAZON.comSo we tried to watch it again.We lasted until about 60 minutes the second time trying to watch it and finally gave up.I think my wife's exact words were ... ""OK, enough already. You have to put something else in to watch.  This is stupid and I don't care what happens to these losers""."
"113 people on Amazon rate this show a 5 star,.. people PLEASE !This show is so lame,.. I can't believe it is not on Prime.I am sorry I even paid for one season.Pathetic !"
"I found this series opener full of the usual American empty characters and gratuitous emotion. No substantive plot. Plus, it was constantly interrupted by the Amazon downloading. I did not finish it."
This is one of those shows that needs to grow on you. So far it hasn't found any arable land here. I'm being patient and maybe somebody will sprinkle me with fertilizer in the future.
This series is just alright. The acting is good and the characters are good but it is just alright. It isnt overly funny and it isn't real serious- it is sort of in the middle. I mildly enjoyed to pass the time but I wouldn't pay more than the membership to watch it .
"I don't know quite what I was expecting,but this first episode was ok, but not particularly entertaining. It wasn't really bad, so maybe others will like it more than I did."
"I love the high school kids, I love the music . . . so much I found my eyes misting up. Ya . . . and I want them to win the Glee Club competition sooooo much.I've fallen in love . . .Hey . . . I'm a vet, I love military history, The Alien Trilogy, The Terminator Trilogy and Battlestar Galactica. I want to see the wall pasted with the bad guys.Can this really be happening . . . :)Note: At this moment I am pretty disappointed. I cancelled my subscription to Glee . . . the pilot was definitely a 4 star in my book. But the following series went downhill, IMO. The music changed, the plot seemed to get muddled and uninteresting. But especially the music . . . totally different. Mostly an obscure collection of semi-modern lyrical. Just disappointing"
"I love the Terminator Series. And it is FUN to have a bit more of the story to think about and enjoy.  However, there is so little story, and so much video game action, that you really can never stop thinking that you are in a video game, and not ""watching a movie with a story and a plot.""  To be clear, this is NOT a video game. It is a fan-fiction type of story that was made with animation software that you would see in video gaming software. Everything caries that jerky animation quality common to older video games. Still, this is an actual story of several chapters and it is fun in the respect that you are engaged once again in the Terminator Saga.I would give it a C- for a grade for the story. :(  Slow, boring in places... and it is hard to do that with an action film.  The graphics are really not so good.  Machima is NOT ready for Movie making in my opinion.  The technology isn't there yet.  So, graphic images fall flat.Still, it is fun to see more of the classic Terminator series! (even if there was no real story, and less visual interest.JJ"
Not real impressed with a cartoon that has an udder on a male bovine. Typical uninteresting and dull cartoon: snooze
"I stopped watching Royal Pains; plots predictable, character development not forthcoming and sidekick brother too 'not bright' and smarmy.  It's a pretty and shiny series with not much meat.  Went back to watching ""Law and Order"" reruns and the new ""Chicago Fire"".  I like genuine characters--who risk their lives protecting people, who grapple with serious ethical and moral conflicts.  I like real heroes."
i just could not get into this movie. I wonder why it was  ever made. Do not bother watching it.
"Looking for an edgy TV police show, found a very slick, poorly written and acted show.  Lots of potential, none of it realized."
Not a fun series to watch. Too much heavy drama. I guess there are no good people left in the world and these deeply undercover cops are the only blue line left.
I personally think there are better family and educational cartoon shows out there for young children. This isn't a program that is watched very often at our house.
"I usually love Robin Williams, which is why we started watching it.  But it was so depressing that we turned it off about 15 minutes into the movie.  It may say hilarious, but the whole time we saw it, there was not one funny line."
"I think this is the lowest rating I've ever given a Robin Williams movie. Sorry, but I really did not like much of anything about it except Robin.Lance Clayton (Robin Williams) is a writer who has never been published, and an English teacher at the same school his douchebag of a son attends. The pejorative is Lance's, and it is deserved. Kyle (Daryl Sabara) is a spoiled, foul-mouthed, scheming, brat who is obsessed with all sorts of sexual kinks, among them hanging himself while masturbating. I know there's a technical term for it, and I lost a friend to the thing. It's of course very dangerous, because one can accidentally kill himself.And that's exactly what Kyle did. His father walked in on him doing this almost-hanging thing once, and was shocked, and told him how dangerous it was. Kyle blew off his father's advice just like he blew off everything his father said. But one day he did indeed accidentally kill himself.So Lance arranged the body as if it was a real suicide instead of an accidental one, and wrote a suicide note for Kyle, so that no one would have to know how perverted the kid was. Then one of the students (or was it one of the teachers?) discovered the suicide note in the police records and published it. They had all hated Kyle, but now it turns out he was a gifted writer and a tortured kid. He had only one friend, who was as much afraid of him as everyone else, was not doing well in school, disgusted all the girls, and had a serious case of the hots for his father's girlfriend, the art teacher (Alexie Gilmore).Inspired, Lance wrote an entire journal for Kyle, full of teenage angst, which Claire (the art teacher) encouraged him to publish. They did, and passed it around the school, and made a sensation, and Lance was invited onto a TV show to talk about it, and . . .Oh, I'm giving too much away. It's listed as a comedy, and I suppose it is in a dark sort of way, but I didn't find it all that funny. Robin Williams does his best, but I don't think anyone could have given this film a focus that would hold up to the seriousness of the topics. Yes, troubled teens are a major problem, and everyone wants to try to keep them from committing suicide, but I'm not sure this is the way."
"No, I didn't give this a low rating because I want to see Mork and Mindy.  No, not because it has auto-erotica.  No, not because I don't like dark humor.  I gave it a low score because...well...because it just wasn't &#34;hilarious&#34;, &#34;wonderful&#34;, or &#34;bold&#34;.  I gave it 2 stars because I'm feeling generous, but if I go on much longer I will change my mind."
The son of Williams in this film is so troubled and so rediculous he hates everyone and everything in life including himself. But the anti-homophobic [...] he uses in the first 30 minutes of the film is nearly 30 times. It seemed to me it was a film about hating everyone and a kid so far out of control there was no help... Williams must have needed the paycheck to pay for his heart surgery... this film is a bottomless pit of insult and a whacked out kid who mistreats everyone including his dad... and the dad seems to be caught up in his own selfish rediculous life.... is this the way Americans are?? Sure seems it. What a let down. What an insult for an actor to take a role than try to tell us how genuis it was for a homophobic film to be put out... would we say the same if the word [...] was used instead of the fag word...? As a gay male this is something the Catholics would love to see and bigots are sure to give a great review. For me an open minded free thinker... this is a waste of life and time. I gave it two stars for the acting BUT... (and butts come in all sizes) I doubt Amazon will post it.
"I generally enjoy ""north of the border"" movies and am generally generous with my stars.  The antagonist has potential as an actor so keep going fella.  The movie started well and had a good story going for the most part.  For me, it all took a nose dive during that last third of the movie and never recovered.  It wasn't insulting so give it a rainy day watch and post your comments to calibrate mine one way or another..."
"While overall I found the series to be mostly entertaining there were a few characters who really grated me with their apparent lack of importance to the series story or their characters personalities in the show itself, mostly with the apparent uselessness of Claire and the conniving mother of the Petrelli brothers who you really wished the character Sylar would kill ruthlessly but which never happened. This season like with the third tried to give us a new foil to match the villain Sylar with dubious results but much better then the third season second villain who at the end was pathetically killed off easily,  the fourth season new villain could have been better written but all in all wasn't truly horrible.  If you have the seasons 1-3 I would actually say just stick with those as while you can add on the fourth overall the episodes were pretty bland and though you'll get some more heroes episodes to watch you'll still probably feel a little cheated regardless."
Just continues to go down hill.  I can see why the network did not renew.  A disappointing finish to a show with a great potential.
I ordered this before I realized it is a video comic. I am not a fan of video/digital comics and this is the reason for the low rating.  I did not finish watching it when I realized what it is.
"Welcome to the ADD format.  The ""episodes"" are about three minutes long; two per download.  Just when the story is getting interesting the episode is over.  Not to mention if you want to get really sick of a theme song listen to it forty-eight times more or less in a row.  An interesting story butchered by the desire to squeeze every last penny out of it in this format."
"Other reviewers who have called this series 'Melrose Space' have labeled it exactly as I would. I wanted to like the show; the actors and set production on the space ship are really attractive to look at but...its an empty shell when your all finished with the show. I like Ron Livinston from Band of Brothers and he's fine here as is his narration that accompanies each episode. But these astronauts spend most of their time on earth pursuing the opposite sex and acting like stupid college kids when they go to the 'astronaut bar' every night after work. I'm just an 'average' sci-fi fan so my view is when its good--like Battle Star Galactica, its good. And when its not--like Defying Gravity, its not. And one more thing, in sci-fi above all else, you have to get the ""alien"" whatever that is or looks like, you have to get it 'right', it has to scare you or blow your mind in some way. And in Defying Gravity when we finally get to the 'alien', the threat to the crew, its a 'dud', its about as 'scary' as a piece of almond rocca candy, only in this case the candy is the most powerful thing in the Universe--yawn. Get the first season of ""SGU"" (stargate universe)with Robert Carlyle--I did, and it was WAY better than Defying Gravity and probably why its second season is showing on TV now!"
"Trying to address mental illness is very tough in any context and I applaud the effort.  The shortcomings (in my opinion only) are that not all mental health patients should disregard medications that may make them less stressful on the caretakers. I understand the husband agreeing to the absence of medication but I am not sure I like the idea of the children (who were not asked their opinion before birth) having to find coping mechanisms for dealing with a parent who is so obviously ill; I speak from personal experience on the subject.  If the character wanted children than the price of using moderating medication until they are adults (and able to understand the consequences fully if the choice is offered at that time) should have been paid. It is very complex situation and hardly fair to try to cover it in a one hour tv show but at least it brings the conversation forward and, as I said I applaud the effort.  Thank you."
"Season One of Lie to Me was promising. The premise was interesting, the plots engaging and Tim Roth is a wonderful actor. However, by Season Two, the flaws that are inherent in a show about someone who ALWAYS knows when people are lying started to wreak havoc. (Hey, why bother with a judicial system? Just have Lightman ask, ""Did you do it?"")The main problem with Lie to Me is that Cal Lightman is the only character who is interesting.  I mean, what do the rest of them actually DO? There are twenty or so people running around a fancy office suite that is called the ""Lightman Group"" but where's the group? They've got an intern, Eli Loker, whose job it is to look scruffy.  Although, later he gets promoted to ""vice-president"" after a year of being an UNPAID intern.  (I should only be so lucky.  And who's president anyway?  Who's on first?) Torres is obviously window dressing.  (She doesn't even have any training in psychology--let alone acting.) And Lightman's partner, Foster, is there to say ""I feel your pain"" and stumble around on 6-inch stilettos. (To be fair, all the women in the show wear 6-inch stilettos. And don't get me started on the collagenized lips.) And because Lightman is the only person with brains, the writers had to invent juvenile stuff for the other characters to do (i.e. almost kissing, nearly kissing, finally kissing) which didn't require any. Bo-ring.The other glaring problem is that by the second half of Season Two, it becomes manifestly clear that the writers have no idea what they are doing. First, Lightman has to pay off his ex-wife in order to keep her from taking their daughter to another state. (That NEVER happens in real life. With joint custody, neither parent can move the child out of state. Didn't these people watch Boston Legal?) Having paid off his wife, his business is about to collapse. (What is his business anyway? Why does he need all those people? And if all he has to do is stare at a person to figure out what they're thinking, why does he need all that equipment?) So, he gets involved with Clara, who has scads of money but is dumb as a post. (They eventually get rid of Clara because she really, really can't act. She just has these enormous LIPS, which they figured would distract the audience from the fact that there was NO PLOT.) Then, Lightman does something stupid with some Peruvians (who weren't from Peru, by the way. They were home-grown Latinos. You could tell by the accents, and the fact that the Sendero Luminoso has been defunct for about 30 years, give or take a decade.) Now Lightman's afraid of losing custody of his daughter (When did he get custody? I thought his ex had custody). So the FBI agent who hangs around the Lightman Group (doing what exactly?) breaks the law not just once, but several times, so Lightman can keep his daughter. (Although, frankly, I'd give her up.  She's an airhead, and that ""deer caught in headlights"" look wears thin after awhile. And why is she ALWAYS hanging around her father's office? Doesn't she go to school?) But the agent doesn't get fired, because by now the Lightman Group has broken so many laws it would be ridiculous to fire an FBI agent for impersonating an officer, withholding evidence, obstructing justice...you know, all those little things you'd normally go to jail for.With all the inconsistencies, logic errors and contrivances, the plots got increasingly incoherent, until NOBODY could follow what was going on. Not even the Harvard grad who came up with the idea for the show in the first place. Even if you think you know what the stories are about, you really don't, because nothing the characters do makes any sense...not in this world or the next. (Why get yourself admitted to a mental hospital to have a two-minute conversation with someone.  Why not just go and talk to her?) And when you haven't got a decent story, the obvious thing to do is to keep transmogrifying your main character (all you Buffy fans know what that word means). Now he's a psychologist, now he's a former criminal, now he's Rambo, now he's a gambling addict, now he's an overprotective father, now he's sleeping with that awful Clara with the LIPS god help me ... and then add enough bombs, terrorists, and psychokillers until, you hope, the audience will have completely lost sight of whatever it was the writers thought they were doing when they should have been WRITING.I have to stop, because the more I think about this show the worse it gets . . . and I really like Tim Roth. (sigh)"
This used to be hilarious. Now it is simply obnoxious. The series is no longer funny at all. This is mainly due to Danny De Vito. This is a sad development for a series that was extremely funny.
"We live in Philadelphia and also like Danny DeVito.  We don't watch network t.v. comedies.  SO I don't know if this is what is considered good, funny t.v. these days.  But this just seemed like going through the motions.  There were a few laughs.  But mostly it was just annoying to watch."
Wow... I can't believe I am saying this.. I am a big fan of this series... but the 3rd season.. BORING.Feel like I wasted my $20 and I am not sure I even want to finish the unwatched shows.Just my .02Yawn.
"This is the second time I've started watching this.  I couldn't watch it, too much suffering and sadness.  Nothing that I would recommend."
"Great cast - great acting, but ??????  Maybe after watching it another time it will make more sense and all the jumping around won't bug me as much the first time?"
Movie lasts less than 2 hours.  Seemed like 3 hours.  Characters and script generally not believable.  This is directorial debut of a screenwriter.  Lack of directorial experience shows.  Excellent cast wasted.
Could not figure out what the story line was. Movie hopped around the lives of several different women and different time lines. I could not follow it and turned it and off after about 30 minutes.
"Started out decent. Timothy Hutton really loses his acting ability in this one. He delivers lines like he just read them or someone is holding cue cards off screen. Obviously just made this one for the pay check. Many of the supporting actors seem to have no acting ability either. However, Miguel &Aacute;ngel Silvestre is very good. The dialog lets him down at times but have to give him a well done on his acting. Not familiar with his other movies but will definitely find more of his films."
"We stopped watching after the protagonist, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, and his brother's spiky widow, with whom he had been edgily squabbling for a long time, and to whom he had whinged about feeling rejected, suddenly embraced each other passionately and lunged into bed."
I was looking for more of a sneak peak and not so much of an interview with the actors. Not what I wanted.
"This is clearly a Thai film! You can tell Tony Jaa and crew got alot more money to make this film compared to the others but it leaves alot to be desired! In most martial arts flicks the fighting barely borders on believavble but this movie goes way past that line. Mainly at the end. It's like Rambo without the guns. Other than that the sequences are a bit jarring and the acting was kinda over the top in small doses. The costumes were fantastic though. I know it sounds like im ripping on this movie but im comparing it to Jaa's previous movie ""The Protector""! Now that was amazing. This movie would definately appeal to younger viewers. Perhaps 12-18 years of age? I cant wait for the day when Hollywood gets together with Tony! That's gonna be good!..."
This is about a father who is into substance abuse who seems to think it is ok to pass these traits to his kid. It shows how irresponsible the left coast is. We can say what a wonderful performance. Doesn't anyone look at the substance of the show. If you try to live by the golden rule these folks live by the it's all about me. If this is the real world.God help America.
"This is the soap opera of sci fi.  One reviewer said it was Battlestar Gallactica mixed with Stargate: I think this was supposed to be Deep Space Nine.  The first episodes were somewhat interesting, yet full of pretty speculative assertions and at least one enormous assumption.  Yeah, the Air Force has put some kind of a puzzle into your video game and if you solve it, they just might kidnap you.  Pretty sure that isn't happening, so put the controller down and get out into the sunshine kiddo.  They also put all kinds of tired liberal clich&eacute;s into the writing.  The guy who beats his kid because of his Desert Storm experience?  Well, they don't know much about actual abuse stats, but that is sort of the way an out of touch Hollywood writer type sees the world.  And by the way, not all black soldiers are abusive, unless we're talking Hollywood.  The worst problem was bringing back O'Neill as some kind of serious bureaucratic jerk.  I wish I could just wash this out of my brain."
"I really liked SG-1 and I liked Atlantis even more.  And after watching Atlantis for the second time I decided to go ahead and try to watch universe.  I agree it is somewhat like BG although honestly I loved that series.  This is almost work to watch.  It complicated and annoying and dark.  BG was dark too but it moved right along.  Atlantis was exciting and fun and almost campy.  I could watch it while I did other things and still enjoy it.  SGU demands my attention and when I waste time just watching it it's not fun at all.  I'll try to keep going but if they don't get off that ship soon I'll have to quit.  I'm up to episode ""Life"" and so far overall the series sucks.  Half way through the season, there is no one moment of joy so far.  I'm going to skip to the last episode of season one and then hope season 2 is better."
"Didn't have the fun and quality characters of the original Stargate Series.  These characters were too self-involved, too much unnecessary sex, very little self-discipline.  Overall the characters were not people with whom I would choose to spend time.  the plots didn't resolve themselves satisfactorily.  Was disappointed."
Not worthy of the name stargate.  Mostly a soap about a bunch of petty egos.  very little to do with good  sci fi.....  Got better toward the end of second season but  I had to keep asking &#34;who writes this crap&#34;
"I'm all for change, nothing wrong with changing the format up when it is for the better, but who ever thought this was for the better is crazy. It had a few ok moments at best, but all the will they won't they crap, angst and all that nonsense was just annoying as heck. Plus it was pretty much Battlestar Galactica 2.0, as much as they try to deny it, that is all it was."
"YAWN! that pretty much sums it up. I watched it on DVD after reading the reviews and it was even slower than I expected. No real science because what they presented as science was hogwash. Boring plots, boring characters. The main storyline could have been a really interesting one but they messed that up completely. Not surprised it got cancelled this show is a failure."
"Okay, ""we're not supposed to be here""...  we get it.  Too bad the producers didn't take the advice of their own tag-line and reconsider ever creating this ridiculous show.  I wonder how many devout Stargate fans would have been willing to make a monetary contribution to MGM for an episodic solution to SGU. Specifically, if the Wraith were to ambush the Destiny and life-suck these miserable characters right out of the Stargate franchise. Please be aware, this is not Stargate; it's Stargate trying to be Battlestar Galactica trying to be Lost and ends up being just more mindless drama except that it's in outer-space.I'll give ya a couple of examples how this series differs from the other two.  In SG1 there was an underlying sub-plot through most of the series' 10 years, involving serious emotions between O'Neil and Carter which tragically, they were unable to ever satisfy due to military restrictions against fraternization.  SGU flippantly adds a scene in the first five minutes of the first episode with one of the principal characters shagging a fellow officer in a broom closet.  That's one thing about the two original series, having served in the military myself, they always tried to portray the airforce with dignity and as much realism as sci-fi can afford.  Another example is that SG1 and SG Atlantis never really discuss the matter of religion however neither did the writers feel the need to casually insult it and at one time Teal'c even questions his team whether they'd ever read the christian bible, which he had and apparently found to be rather profound.  SGU, on an early episode, cheerfully shows a catholic priest in the role of an abusive, chronic alcoholic.I wonder if the producers ever considered for one second that just maybe, Stargate fans liked a more positive and upbeat universe and for their characters to be compassionate and kind of heroic while not taking themselves too seriously.  Did they ever think that just maybe some people aren't interested in tuning in week after week to watch a group of angry jerks vying for power in a seemingly hopeless situation while being filmed by an apparently, paranoid camera crew.Gonna be completely honest here and say I only made it about halfway through season one because after watching this show for a few weeks I eventually gave up hoping it would all get better and just sank to the ground (kinda like Charlton Heston at the end of Planet of the Apes) and railed at MGM: ""You maniacs! You blew it up!"" etc."
Interesting concept that suffers from uneven dialogue writing and stupid plots.A certain mad scientist gets annoying with his tantrum throwing. Sci-Fi dumbed down right before your eyes.
"It's one thing to speculate; it's another to make a ridiculous statement: &#34;Moses was the only person to ever see God.&#34; Wow - hubris, move over! a new low in standards of broadcasting. This entire series has been great to watch (the Romans was excellent, and Martin Luther was too) but I stopped dead in my tracks and hit the stop button on the intro to this one - reading the other reviews, there's a lot to be avoided in this episode - I have no idea what they were thinking when they wrote this, but just bad writing ruined it. &#34;One nation conquered over and over was the Israelites; no people in history were more likely to be forgotten.&#34; What? Plain crap. Bad history. Not true, and it doesn't end there, they go on and on, and do very little objective &#34;history.&#34; Don't dump the series, just skip this clunker!"
"Like I said don't bother watching this show at all because the acting is so bad. The only couple good episodes are the Beast of Monteray, Dover Demon, Vampires, and the giant centipede one. Overall still bad but those I think are the best ones."
"I just watched the very beginning and decided that it wasn't something I would like, so I didn't finish it."
I enjoy watching shows with real evidence proof like forensic files. This show is created poorly with subject matter had to believe. Was deceived by the title.
"While ""Sanctuary"" is a clever science-fiction show, it's never especially compelling.  Much of the time, I find myself falling asleep halfway through an episode.  (If, at that point, I happen to switch to some other time-shifted TV show on my DVR or a DVD, there usually isn't any nodding off, so it's not a question of fatigue.)  Every week, a wild not-entirely-half-baked storyline is thrown out, a lot of crazy business ensues and, by the end of the episode, the whole Sanctuary team is sipping tea in Helen Magnus' office.  While the show touches upon interesting topics such as giant abnormals living in the earth in some sort of collective Gaia-like symbiotic relationship, every week this sort of thing is being fired your way en masse.  Sanctuary blends steampunk, religion (Kali, for one), abnormal myth (vampires, werewolves, etc.), historical figures (James Watson, Jack the Ripper, Nikola Tesla, etc.), science and adventure together and then funnels the concoction down your throat.  It's all a little hard to swallow.  **1/2 out of *****.That being said, I was glad to see the loss of one regular character this season (hint: it's the worst actor on the show) and the introduction of a new one.  The whole Cabal storyline is wrapped up entirely too quickly.Despite my issues with the show, I also watched season 3, which introduces hollow earth into the mix and is an improvement over season 2."
Nice idea for this show -- a real comedian (instead of a vanilla entertainer) leading the audience through a clip show.  But the producers spend way too much time on Tosh and not enough on the real content.
"Unfortunately, this show is going in the direction of most of the other fare on tv. It is shaping up to be the evil aliens (who really look awful instead of beautiful) against the good guys (FBI agent, priest, etc., as rebels).  The entire show this time advanced that premise rather than developing other aspects.  I wish the aliens weren't so unrelievedly beautiful on the surface and evil underneath too.  It doesn't leave much room for interesting stories other than good guys vs. bad guys.  The only thing I enjoyed this time was looking at the beautiful alien Anna and the neat way she could try on outfits virtually.  I doubt I will watch this next week.  I think I will stick with FlashForward and Fringe as my sci fi of choice this season.  Save your money."
"I'm going to start off by saying that while I love and adore the original sets of V miniseries (V and V: THE FINAL BATTLE), I absolutely loathed the spin-off weekly series. Waaaaay too soap-opera for me.With the advent of smarter and deeper television over the last decade, I was first in line to give the new V series a chance, especially since it had featured so many actors that I had loved from other shows I loved (Elizabeth Mitchell from LOST, Morena Baccarin AND Alan Tudyk from FIREFLY and Laura Vandervoort from SMALLVILLE), and a modern sensibility brought to a great Sci-Fi concept is usually a good thing (see BATTLESTAR GALACTICA).But where the old V miniseries succeeds is every place that the new V weekly series falls short.First, there's character: After watching the first ten episodes, I found, and not for nostalgia's sake, that I cared more about the original miniseries' characters over the course of 3-4 hours than I ever did about any of the characters on this incarnation. There is just nothing there to connect with. Mitchell's FBI/mom character is the only one that has anything to work with and it's just not enough. Baccarin's Anna has none of the gleeful devilishness of the original series' Diana; Scott Wolf's Chad Decker is so much of a non-entity that I'm surprised that he's even credited.Second, the plot: It's pretty much the same as the original, but the V's seem to be bringing more with them. And certainly their weapons are more high-tech. And they've been here before, developing ""sleeper cells"" which is a change from the original. But in a Post-9/11 America, we sure are awful quick to accept the V's, which just doesn't hold water. And conversely, we're awful quick to determine that there has to be a Resistance against these evil V's... and this is all in the first episode.Third, the action: Where is it? There was never a moment of tension that was more than barely palpable in all the episodes I watched.In the final analysis, I stopped watching not because it doesn't match up to the original, but because it could be smarter and more tense, and it just isn't. I gave it chance after chance, but besides the few moments I thought worked, there were so many that didn't.I never thought that I'd be yearning for the days of Marc Singer, but the new V series does make you more than just nostalgic. It makes you wonder why, when there have been great Sci-Fi shows like LOST, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and FIREFLY, that this is a show that has been successful. It's obvious that ABC is looking for its next LOST, but V is not it. Not by a long shot."
"The story of V does not adapt well. The dialogue is at parts very boring. The teenage love interest is very, well dry and stereotypical of a teenage drama. The teenage drama often detracts from the main story line. It tries to create a 24 sense of urgency at times, but fails. I could explain more, but bottom line there are far better choices out there. Season two barely made it from being canceled. Do not expect a third season."
BOring.  Weak.  Poorly filmed.  Don't waste your time.  BOring.  Weak.  Poorly filmed.  Don't waste your time.  Don't waste your time.
"This account of her life seems quite sanitized, almost like the Hollywood press releases of old; in the days when the studio painted their 'version' of a star.  There were certainly contradictory remarks made by different 'associates' of Crawford, you were never sure if they were friend or foe.  Certainly interesting stories about her early days in Hollywood, but not a lot about her personal life.  Only one of her children commented on Joan as a mother, and she was one of the twins adopted later than Christina and Christopher.  Did the abuse occur?  I think it did.  I've seen and read the accounts of Crawford 'insiders' who were witnesses to what went on behind closed doors.  So, all in all, I guess this isn't a terrible 'Bio', but I would like to have seen something a little more than a fluff piece, but one that really dug in."
I liked Jeff Dunham on his TV appearances but was disappointed in this show.  I guess he thinks he has to have some crude content to be funny.
I have always enjoyed Jeff Dunham on variety shows.  He has created some great characters and is very funny.  Unfortunately the concept just doesn't work.
"This is a comedy that is too slapstick for my taste. It's old and it shows its age with juvenile humor that is past its prime. Shirley Temple is one of the students of the teacher, not a main character. Watch it if you want to see Shirley as a tiny waif, but you've been warned."
"SPOILERS WARNING....J.J. Abrams has a huge slap coming from me. The reason is simple: I swore to my wife years ago that if I should ever discover an actual name behind the 'pioneering' camera shake, I'd slap him (or her). No one needs to see a film that looks like a frightened tourist's film of an erupting volcano while fleeing it.That is perhaps my biggest beef with this film. Abrams is shown in the mini-documentary actually shaking and/or slapping the camera as he is shooting key scenes. This, along with ""the glare"" (from stage lighting) is Abrams' big innovation. This camera quivering and vertigo-inducing swooping is why I have wanted to slap him for so long.As to this film, let us speak as we find: this is not even a remake, much less a homage. It is a highjacking. Though the actors are flawless and talented beyond description for their performances here, it is en evil waste. By starting the film with a history-shifting time traveler, Abrams has cheated everyone who sees this, everyone who retains the love of the original series.Having said that, it is a bloody brilliant move. The so-called Star Trek ""franchise"" was at an apparent end. The TV series ""Enterprise"" had failed miserably; no one seemed to be in control of the intellectual property of Star Trek itself; fans felt a sort of dying era taking place right here, right now. This film saves us from that fate...or does it?In the distant future, an elderly Spock gets embroiled with angry Romulans since he apparently is responsible for their home planet (Romulus) being destroyed. A surviving faction of Romulans--especially nasty leader Nero--go flying backward in time, and Spock is forced along behind them. They appear 25 years before James T. Kirk is born, and they wait.Kirk's father is captain of a starship. The nasty Nero destroys the ship...and James T. Kirk's father. Here is the bloody marvel and the disgrace: this event has offered us a parallel universe-reality, and from thence the film takes off, going boldly where I wished it hadn't. The elderly Spock is now on a mission to see that Nero is destroyed, which task can only fall to Kirk, of course. Meanwhile, the alternate reality trick goes stale rapidly. Vulcan, along with Spock's mother Amanda, is destroyed (and so is the screen time for Wynona Rider); Young Spock is entangled and enamored with Lt. Uhura; Chekov is a little faerie who is damned good at beaming people anywhere; Kirk himself is a rather gay-looking idiot and part-time drunkard; the rest of the clan is essentially ignored.Abrams and all involved are truly innovative and brilliant. But this film cannot pass without further comment. The ghosts of De Kelley and Jimmy Doohan will never rest now. Too many people still remember them with happiness and the pain at the loss of them. Yet here they are, along with the others, being mimicked or parodied or whatever one wishes to call it. I cannot fathom how Nimoy could agree to star in this, but he did. Who else could play ""Spock Prime"" as he is credited?My advice is that if you are a purist, don't see this. If you are a curious, adventurous and sacred-cow-kicking fan, see it. Don't miss it if you are a fan of lunk-head director J.J. If you like cinema for its own sake, see it by all means. I for one felt a bit robbed by it all. I cannot begin to imagine what Rodenberry might have thought of this desecration."
Not much to look at. A straight ad. Some pretty sights but not worth the time it took to watch
"I was disappointed in that it is a travel advertisement dressed up like a movie. The movie is okay, but I would have not downloaded it had I known."
"Too long to get going I did not watch it completely through to long to start up,  these are seals let me see some action"
"Meant to be a tribute to our troops,... I think.  That it does, but it jumps all over the place blink and you will lose the plot. Really,  there are better films out there don't waste your time on this one."
"Seal Team VI is like all other war films supported by the Department Of Defense. The story line is pretentious as is the dialogue created for the characters. There is way too much chest pounding and too little action in Seal Team VI, which relies more on DOD supplied war footage than action scenes created by all involved in making this movie. I was really embarrassed for the producers, the director and the writers, who in their mind's eyes made a homage to the Seal Team program. This film is as bad as &#34;The Green Berets,&#34; starring John Wayne, which was  a homage to the Army's elite unit, the Green Berets. People with service backgrounds should stay away from being creative, and leave it to the professionals. The DOD influence just muddies the creative waters. Only Oliver Stone served up a film depicting his Vietnam experience that proved to be Oscar worthy in his 1986 film,&#34;Platoon.&#34; These other wanna be film makers fell on their face in their attempts and Jeremy Davis, in my opinion, is one of them."
"Just did not work for me.  The action was weak, unbelievable.  Writing was not very strong.  Maybe the actors are very popular over seas and that's what carried the movie.  But I would not recommend it to anyone."
"I was able to see this film in my home as part of a sneak peak preview this month. Luckily I was able to see the original first as if I had watched this disappointing sequel first, I may never have bothered to watch the vastly superior original. The film is bogged down with a tedious plot that only slows the action down. The stunts are still impressive, but it just doesn't deliver like the original film. Too bad! :-("
"I heard about this from my son, he said he just laughs and laughs. I don't. I find the mom character the most amusing, especially when her son said he used to pretend she wasn't his mother, she said &#34;me too&#34;...much like the comedy Arrested Development (I believe she is the same actress). Other than that, I haven't so much as smiled."
How depressing. I'm tired of all these unsolved missing person cases with no resolution. I've seen too many of these sorts of mysteries and want a show about all the people that are found and how the detectives or whoever was involved went about it. The police should bring in a good psychic in some of these seemingly hopeless cases. They might be able to help. I feel terrible for the families and friends who suffer this terrible unsolved loss and it's just too upsetting to watch anymore. My heart goes out to them.
"Not so good. A bunch of &#34;smarmy, look at me&#34; crooks and murderers that want to get a little bit more noteriety by bragging about their despicable deeds. Would not recommend."
"I LOVE the Poirot moves and David Suchet is Poirot embodied. However, since there are many other reviews that give better information on the content of these movies, I am simply commenting on the quality of the video.For some reason, this specific episode is really grainy. I'm not exactly complaining because I'm streaming them at such a little cost through AmazonPrime's annual $79 fee which is a mere pittance. To use the language of Poirot  :DJust saying... I don't know why this one is not very good quality-wise, and I just watched the previous two in this season and no prob.  It almost looks like old fashioned film."
"This series just tries to be witty by playing on tired old stereotypes. Dull, no insight, puerile. There are so many better things to watch these days."
"This work goes into how a free woman could marry and stay with a husband who has life in prison.  To each their own.  I wish the two of them the best.  However, one thing didn't sit well with me.The wife wants to have a biological child with her husband.  If Florida doesn't allow conjugal visits, then why would they allow semen to travel across the prison walls?  I believe the Supreme Court said marriage is a fundamental right; however, the same is not absolute about procreation.  Let's face it: most children raised in a house with one income with a parent that will never be free will likely face lots of poverty.  Further, sexual violations and drugs are common in prisons.  What if the man-goo has a disease in it?  What if a woman like Octomom wants to keep having children with an incarcerated husband.  The money it would take to raise these kids would have to come from our state, aka our tax dollars.  Further, I think criminologists could argue that in the same way that the punishment of prison involves not having contact with the opposite sex; along those lines perhaps prisoners forfeit their ability to reproduce.  There are already far more than 1 million children with incarcerated parents alive; they face circumstances that are not easy.  Further, Mrs. Bailey proves that she has a big heart; a parentless child already alive could greatly benefit from having her as a parent, or foster parent.In short, this woman's wish is just NOT going to happen.  It would set a very dangerous and costly parent.  I identify as a political progressive.  I sympathize with the folk in prison.  But this reproducing is just not going to happen and prison wives need to just accept that."
"boring.  I didn't even watch the whole set.  I relisted it, immediately. could not get into. the movie was so funny, not the tv show."
I don't really love Little Bear because it looks ok that was so very angry and I really hate this show
"Honestly, I generally don't care for romances.  This was a little different from the usual more like &#34;Ghost&#34; was several years back, but more of a wispy ghost than a felt presence guiding events!  Somewhat disappointed by the nuances of the characters feeling their way through loss and unrequited relationships!  The music background was not to my liking, but then we all have different tastes!"
"The Eclipse (Conor McPherson, 2009)After I hit paydirt with Outcast, the wonderful Scots urban fantasy picked up for US distribution by Bloody Disgusting not long ago, I figured I'd see what else the British Isles had in store for me. Ireland has been a solid, if not necessarily prolific, producer of good horror films over the past fifteen years (viz. Isolation or Dead Meat). The Eclipse, which boasts a cast headed up by Ciaran Hinds (There Will Be Blood), Aidan Quinn (Benny and Joon), and Iben Hjejle (Defiance) as the woman they're both in love with, seemed like just the thing with which to pass a gloomy, snowy Friday night. Unfortunately, it fell quite flat.Hinds plays Michael Farr, a volunteer at a literary festival who is still reeling from the recent death of his beloved wife (Hannah Lynch in her only screen appearance to date). He is assigned as a driver for two visiting notables, paranormal researcher Lena Morrell (Hjelje) and horror novelist Nicholas Holden (Quinn). Holden, an American, is married, but the cat is away, and he's got his sights set on bedding Morrell. Michael, on the other hand, initially sees Morrell as a possible gateway to understanding why he sees&#8212;or believes he sees&#8212;the ghost of his wife, but he, too, begins to fall for her.Ultimately, I believe The Eclipse is an attempt at the supernatural-drama subgenre that the Southeast Asian film market has honed to a fine edge, and that most of the rest of the world doesn't really know exists. It is unsuccessful, though I have no way of knowing whether to blame the original story (by Billy Roche) or its adaptation (by McPherson); either is possible. Another rewrite might have made it a bit more coherent and turned a collection of interesting scenes into a full story, but that rewrite never happened, and we got what we got. You can feel free to give this one a miss. **"
"I give two stars here only for the soundtrack and for Ciaran Hinds.As for the rest, it really isn't a ghost story.  It's a narrative mess, muddled and confusing, with the focus taken off of the main character and given to two others whose story is not interesting.Too bad it was so pointless.  It could have been much better."
"No one could fault the production values. But this movie is confusing as hell. Character decisions, conversations and plot points appear incoherently, without enough explanation or exposition or motivation. It's often hard to tell where things are happening, where people are, why they're there, who they're talking about ... All a disjointed mess. Jet Li does a good job playing a confusing character, though."
"I expected like a small prequel or sequel from the original movie but, it was more of  documentary of the actors and their thoughts during the making."
I have now seen the first two dvd's of season three. It's not good. I gave the first two years five stars. It now gets two. Even the music is bad. The theme over the end credits has changed to a fluffy piece.I see the show has been canceled. No wonder.
I'll admit that I only watched a little of this but the violence was beyond my acceptable level so I quit.
Only watched one episode. it was too political for my taste. but i'll give another chance after I finish Game of Thrones.
First program in series was OK but not great. Evaluation will depend on whether we watch other programs in series
"I really looked forward to seeing some of what looked like an epic historical series based on the Roman empire, but what I ended seeing was a lot of violence and sex, and that seems to be the major draw of the series.  Of course, a genuine Roman history buff might appreciate it more, and this series does have a certain epic quality about it.I could even cope with Romans speaking with British accents (what are British actors supposed to speak with?) if I had actually found a character or two to care about.  It seemed like everyone was callous and brutal, and maybe that's the way Rome was, but after sitting through the first episode of this first season, I found myself not wanting to watch any more.I'm sure Rome will go on without me, and my best advice is to find a way to ""try before you buy"" and plunk down a lot of money to find it's not what you expected."
"I could not have been more of the thought that &#34;Well, there's an hour or so that I'll never get back...&#34;"
"PRIDE AND PREJUDICE WITH KEVIN FIRTH WAS OUTSTANDING.. TO MAKE A COMEDY OUT OF A.  SERIOUS DRAMA IN THIS CASE IS UNFORTUNATE. THE LEAD ACTRESS WAS NOT COMPREABLE TO THE ACTRESS IN THE SERIOUS. VERSION.. THE ACTOR PORTRAYING MR BEASLEY WAS EXCELLENT, AND MR BENNETT WAS EXCELLENT. . THE ACTOR PORTRAYING MR DARCY WAS GOOD,  I WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE FILM.."
Slightly annoying...the typical stuff you would expect from this kind of genre. I wish nickelodeon would put out more original shows.
"Fresh water is polluted with drugs we're putting in it, some on purpose and some flushed down.  This movie explores that issue and lets you make the decisions as to how bad it's become."
This movie didn't strike a nerve with me. It seemed to drag. Others may enjoy it tremendously. Suggest you go ahead and watch at least part and make up your own mind.
"MST 3000 is often hilarious.  This episode was slow and tedious with a smart and funny barb coming in at a pace of 1 every 15 minutes.  Dull and boring, I'm sorry to say."
I usually love these type of shows but this one is kinda of boring but it is good if you have nothing else to watch.
"This flick reminded me of 1984 and THX 1138 mixed.  Same kind of story, but with animation, which was really good, but this one just didn't hold my interest and I fast forwarded through much of it.  Maybe it was just the wrong day for me to watch this video, but to me it was boring."
"My son recommended this film but warned me in advance of content.  I should have stopped when I saw JACKASS was involved.  However, I continued.  To think one family terrorizing their own community, living solely on their terms with no consideration for others was glorified in anyway, kind of speaks to the state of our precious home - USA.  If you enjoy JACKASS, you'll like this too."
Neil Jordan's Ondine starring the always dependable Colin Farrell and the enchanting Polish actress.The 1st 3 quarter of the film was captivating with the suitable Irish background and mystery.It fell apart at the final quarter.  It became nothing but a routine eastern mafia smuggling alien to a foreigncountry plot which destroyed all the foregoing mystery and enchantment.A very disappointing recent effort from Neil Jordan.
"I wanted to like this film, we don't always get what we want. The cinematography was just so poor, under lit to the point I couldn't see who was talking or what was happening. Dark bars and night scenes can be shot so that you can still see the action but that requires skill and knowledge that was not evident here. Then there is the audio, it sounds as though the microphones were wrapped in wool. Muffled dialogue in the dark gets real annoying in a very short while, especially when the local accent and colloquialisms are already a challenge to understand. I was beginning to wish for subtitles. So much for the technicalities. The direction was just as poor. the pace of this film went from a fast walk to an agonizing limp then fell to the ground and crawled..slowly, painfully. I really don't care to see another scene in another film where our hero  character announces ""I'm an alcoholic"" at an AA meeting then goes out and sucks down a fifth of booze  straight from the bottle in between lines of anger and self pity! Can you say cliche! The comic relief was..oh that's right there was none. I hate to pick on child actors so I am glad to say there isn't one in this film. The young girl in this film sounded like she was reading and pretending. The woman playing Ondine, Alicja Bachleda, was sublime throughout. She was a living breathing complex creature on many levels. Colin was flat, a character without energy or dimension. I finally decided my evening would be more pleasantly spent trying to breath through a wet towel. Two stars, one for Alicja and one for what might have been."
"I'm sorry, but I found this movie to be incredibly boring. Some friends forced me to watch it. Colin Farrell stars as an Irish fisherman named Syracuse who finds a woman named Ondine in his fishing net. He and his daughter, Annie believe she is a mermaid. I wouldn't recommend ONDINE!!!"
"Reason that I don't like it: the character visuals--there's a robot and a cat, ok. No clue what the other three things are, but the orange one is WAY too much of a ""one-eyed worm"" and screams of inappropriate visual for a child. That said, the songs are fun, simple and repetitious, so my 9-month-old daughter breaks into a smile as soon as she hears them. I played some of the season selection for her one day...because she liked the songs from their ""cameo"" appearances in other shows on Nick Jr. I've since found some other shows with songs that make her smile and laugh that don't have a phallic appearance--such as Go, Diego, Go! and Bubble Guppies.  Edited several months later: I still don't really like Muno's appearance, but I developed the notion that DJ Lance is similar to Ronald McDonald (I met a DC region Ronald...very nice, keeps things friendly and non-threatening and upbeat for little ones), and his odd ""posse"" is akin to Ronald's (Hamburglar, Grimace, Mayor McCheese and Fry Guys roughly = Brobee, Muno, Foofa, Bot), but they aren't promoting eating at a franchise. I still pick other options for my now  toddling child when I see them available, but the messages episodes portray are acceptable. Anyway, that's my ""looking back"" update."
not a fan. daughter didnt sit still long enought to really get a grib on what this is all about
"Boring, bad production values, depressing story. I  couldn't stand to watch these young women's lives being snatched away from them. Way too much blood and guts for me. Just awful."
"This sounded like a great series...but the use of gore and blood in every scene was bordering on the pornographic. It seemed as though the close-up scenes of blood and guts were used to make up for a cliche,lack-luster plot. A waste of my Amazon Instant $$$."
"London Hospital Season 1 [HD] -After watching Selfridges and Call the Midwives, I had high expectations for this series, but after 2 episodes I couldn't become attached to it. To be fair, I should give it another chance, but I'll give it some time between so I can start over with a fresh view. Take a look for yourself. I'd be interested to know what you think. You might change my mind."
"This review has little to do with this mediocre, typical British film.  I rate the video at two stars, max...I lived there for two years, and this is de'javou. (SP?).  This review is about amazon prime streaming video.  I rate that 5 stars.....Anyone having issues with streaming video should look first to their internet connection/provider.  Then, look at your computer system.  I was having difficulty getting a good stream from anyone, (Hulu,WB, and Amazon) and I blamed them all for not providing the stream.  Not true, the stream was there, uninterrupted and in HD.  My provider insisted I was getting 1.5 meg,  I was not, the max I ever got was 664 Kb.  The liar was my internet provider, I should sue them for lying.I bitched about it for 6 mos, and low and behold, a few days ago I started receiving a 2.5 Meg uninterrupted stream.  You can't imagine the difference that made.But that's just part of the story,  I also installed an Nvidia video card, 1GIG, designed for streaming, whoaaa night and day, especially sound quality.  So if you are into streaming, hope this is helpful information.Only negative with Amazon, is they don't encode CC....  That would be a real plus, if they did......"
"The ideal of it is dumb in my opinion. One of those ideals that works for a game but not a series. Sorry, I watched two shows and I just couldn't get into it."
"I'm willing to give this more of a chance, but I don't want to waste too much more time on it.  A boring pilot is all I can claim to have seen thus far, with a simply horrible, irritating sound track.  I hope it picks up."
"Really wanted to like this show; love the 4 gals they brought together; Wendy Malik & Jeane Leves in particular from Frazier, and the amazing Betty White you figure it can't miss right? Well, you can. Its the typical scenerio, bring comedy  'All Stars' together and it SHOULD be awesome/hilarious, and it just isn't. Frazier, Just Shoot Me, and Wings were all 8--10 comedy shows in my book, but this new show rated at best, a '2' for me. So bummed! But just like when Kelsey Grammer went from Frazier to his next show ""Back to You"" (which I thought was hilarious but was a ""1 and done"" season follow up) it takes more than 'Stars' to make a great show. I bought this brand new and wish I hadn't--cause in a short time it will be for sale used on Amazon for less than half price cause its not very funny--that's my take."
"OK. I watched all 4 seasons that are available. This sums them all up for me.This show is about 3 LA women who find themselves in Cleveland, OH, and stay to start a new life. Well . . . that is what we are led to believe. But as the Betty White character states in one of the later seasons the 3 LA women actually are in Cleveland to get ""laid"" because there is too much competition in LA. The first season was fresh, original, and funny. There was the down to earth do gooder character. There were the supportive friend scenes as we learn of each characters' past. There were the funny outrageous comments from the vain shallow character. And there were the laugh out loud tell em like it is comments from Betty White's character. I mean she calls them out for dressing like ""prostitutes"" etc. You see all the actress's former co-workers from other sitcoms appear in each episode which is fun.Then you get to the second season and beyond. These seasons plowed up the foundation laid in the first season. I guess they ran out of steam. Or maybe they wanted to sell out and just stay on the air by appealing to the trashy audience that definitely exists and eats up the garbage this show became. The second, third an dfourth seasons were nothing but people jumping in and out of bed with each other, sexual innuendo about everything, people lying and cheating and stealing, and Betty White's character transforming into some sick person's sick joke of a vision of what an elderly funny character would be. The show could have been set in LA for anyone knew at this point as it was just trashy Californians behaving trashy. The weird thing was there was even an episode to mimic Sex in the City. It was definitely Sex In the City--3 women casually sleeping around and then in the end of the episode whining and commiserating about how they have no sanity tho their lives and wonder why. also the 3 main characters just looked old, fat, and tired in the later seasons. One's hair got so light she was almost blond. The others got so dark that they didn't look like themselves. Valerie Bertinelli looks horrible in season 4. She looks like she is having a really bad pregnancy. Even her hair looks bad . . . . But we are supposed to think that all these young fit youngs want to bed her and stay by her side the next day. Not. They sit Betty Whit eon the sofa with her jacket or shirt riding up in the back like she has been propped up for the scene.The later seasons, to me, appeared to be gay centric in humor. Humor that I have heard from hardcore gays and you see in their tv shows and movies. And while watching the credits I saw who was actually directing it and knew immediately where this influence was coming from. I mean even 3 trashy straight women wouldn't go the direction this influence took them.There are these typical ""behind the scenes"" episodes that appear in each season. They are basically the same and make you think they just want to have a fun-day at work or something. But then again the people who are behind the scenes force their chance to appear in front of the camera. That is VERY obvious. And there are the sickening ""we love each other"" and ""we respect each other"" stock speeches. They are just goofy.Anyway the show is typical American garbage TV that can be skipped. Just a show about animalistic behavior created by trained monkeys."
"We seem to have mostly got past humor that belittles people of color, women, or gay people.  But I guess it's okay to make fun of older people, and to do so by belittling them. 'What's your favorite medication?' says one older person to another.  'Better call him soon, since otherwise he's likely to be dead.'  Etc.Ha ha.  Not."
"Doesn't have all the typical inconsistencies and mediocre dialog as most TV, but this is starting out as a very slow series.  I fear an overly complicated puzzle conspiracy that will only be partially resolved by the end.  That's a big time investment for me."
"First one or two episodes were sort of interesting, but then, the sillies set in. If paranoia is your thing, then you will love this. The usual liberal plot of big bad greedy guys who control world events to make themselves richer. Of course the biggest bad guy is X CIA, who else? The &#34;good guy&#34;, also X CIA, is gay (is that saying something about the writers?). The amount of surveillance portrayed would require an army of people to monitor and maintain all the bugs. Any intelligence agency would love to have the super small devices shown, that somehow seem to function without any visible power source.  All in all, very stupid. Hope I don't get a four leaf clover in the mail over this."
"Great story idea.  Great ensemble of actors.  Terrible script, editing, WAY of telling the story.  Puts one to sleep, no identification with the characters, no backstory to justify hanging in to watch during the long mimic-BBC pauses with the meaningful looks.  Yawn.A Gary Oldman or Alec Guinness or Ian X (really, any of the 'Ian' actors we all know and love), can hold the viewer's interest, during long Brit-like pregnant pauses and silences, which alike baffle the average audience.  Yet actors you rarely see on TV or film, need something more;  they need LINES, or at least meaningful blocking.  Since these long pauses and silences don't seem to add to the plot at all, and since there is no backstory to establish empathy with the characters, one is left waiting waiting waiting for something to be said or done to justify watching further.Some of the reviewers are all happy about the sophistication in the storyline.  Yeah, but if you're watching paint dry for most of each episode, the sophistication doesn't 'pay off'.  We don't need car chases and shoot-em-ups, we need MORE LINES.  Shakespeare knew that.  So why didn't the script writer, here?  Who messed up this good story?So I forced myself to get through the series.  So I don't wonder why AMC pulled the plug.  It's bad scripting and bad film editing; not the acting, and not the plot.  WAY TOO SLOW, people.  WAY TOO LACKING in lines, subplots unexplored, so of course the viewer will be bored.  Were I a potential commercial sponsor, I wouldn't want my commercials playing during this show, due to its snoozy presentation.  Not fair to the actors or the plot, either.  A story which needs to be explored (whether plausible or not) -- just got wasted.  Pity.FIX IT, please, and redo so the audience can follow along, cut all those long meaningless pauses with headshots, substitute meaningful dialog instead, so the audience can connect the dots.  People like whodunits, that's the most popular story format since the Garden of Eden.Then, you'll get a good audience."
This series just drags and drags____ i lost interest and have not watched the rest of the season. I got about 3/4 of the way through the season waiting for a big moment of some sort to happen. It never happened. I may try to finish watching it
"I wasn't sure what to expect when I watched the pilot. The characters and plot appeal, but its so slow. I couldn't help but think &#34;get on with it already.&#34;"
"Potentially this is a great series, but after a few episodes I felt it wasn't getting anywhere. There seems to be a lack of intensity, with story lines that just drift off. I am sure it will all come together in the end, but I don't think I will stick around since I am not enjoying it enough to wait. However, the concept is fascinating and the acting is excellent."
"We like this sort of political/spy drama. We have been enjoying several Scandinavian shows, basically liked the new House of Cards, etc. However, after four eps. we decided to go back to re-watching Justified! We were still curious what the deal with Miranda Richardson was, but otherwise zzzzzz"
I like these kinds of programs. This one disappointed.Confusing and slow. No build of like for any characters except Richardson and ..... Why didn't he pick up the CD? I should stop here.
"I forced myself to sit through 5 episodes just to make sure that I wasn't mistaken in my feelings for this show.  The cinematography of the pilot was brilliant and was the main reason I gave the series more of my time than I ever should have, but even that paled quickly with the lackluster story line and turgid pace of the show.  Five episodes in and there is nothing, absolutely nothing going on, there is so little happening that it makes it hard to point to any one thing that stands out as a problem, it is just so blah that I can't see wasting anymore time on it than it took to write this.Summation, I completely understand why the show was cancelled and support that decision 100%."
"Sorry writers, but this series is a snooze.  I like TV that entertains and provides a mental challenge, but after the second episode I gave up on trying to make sense of the dialog and I was NOT entertained.  I suppose if I had been in the mood to be the fly on the wall in the think tank, I might have appreciated the writing effort.  Late at night I don't want to have to sift through all the information presented."
I loved Kevin Kline in Dave.  It's one of my favorite movies.  I also loved him in the Cole Porter movie.  I writing that to soften my criticism; I feel disloyal when I say he is wasted in this stupid movie.  He is usually wonderful in everything he does.  Just my opinion.
"If you enjoy watching people be odd just for the sake of it - then you might enjoy this, otherwise keep looking for another movie to watch.Good cast - worthless story.Kline plays a prudish bachelor of almost no income, living in a total dump and having fleas - yet he acts like someone with money and sucks up to a wealthy old lady to be included in upper society occasionally. Paul Dano plays an extremely timid loser who rents a cot in Kline's crappy residence. He experiments with cross dressing and has a little crush on Katie Holmes (which goes nowhere). John C Reilly plays a nice but wild and intimidating looking man with a cartoon character type voice.  There really isn't any plot to this story - or any story to this story. Just some odd characters who really aren't interesting at all - especially Dano."
"After enjoying &#34;Wild China&#34; and &#34;Wild Africa&#34; so much, I was expecting so much more, but unfortunately this was extremely disappointing."
"""The Oxford Murders"" is one of the most delightfully bad movies of our time. It's on par with ""Manos,Hands of Fate"",""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" and ""Troll 2."" It has the pretentiousness of The Room combined with the campiness of any Wood (as in Ed) B movie. There are talented actors whose hamminess is redeeming-John Hurt as the professor Arthur Seldom, Anna Massey as a former Enigma codebreaker, and Alex Cox,the director of the superb Sid & Nancy as an obsessed mathematician who suffers hideously from cancer. Hurt saves the movie through overacting--then again,he did voice Aragorn in the Bakshi version of Lord of the Rings.The plot is obvious from the get-go: A grad student, Martin (Elijah Wood) is immediately pounced on by two fangirls-- I mean ladies-- as soon as he arrives in Oxford. There are a series of mathematical murders,not to mention some hilarious dialogue:""I believe in the number pi!""""Beth is not an electron.""""Only this room,you... and the spaghetti."" This movie contains in the notorious spaghetti sex scene. The voluptuous nurse (the singer-songwriter Leonor WatlingPapito) is making spaghetti wearing only an apron, and atop her, Martin slurps it off her bosom. Beth (Julie Cox,who pined for Paul Muad'Dib inFrank Herbert's Dune (Sci-Fi TV Miniseries) (Special Edition Director's Cut) (3-Disc DVD Set)as Princess Irulan) pines for Martin. She doesn't want to be his friend,she wants aBad Romance - The RemixesThe plot is preposterous,and the movie has as much unintentional laughs as---most anything MST3K has tackled. It's a thriller/horror that's been mislabeled. It's a comedy.While it's hilariously,uproariously bad,it gets 3 stars for these reasons-1)Great acting from Hurt (who's been in the great Quentin Crisp biopicAn Englishman in New York),Massey. Even Julie Cox and Leonor Watling channel fangirlishness as they throw themselves at Elijah. They probably read the Frodo's Harem website to prepare themselves.2)The great Bach piece at the end. This movie needed more JS Bach,frankly. Beth's character plays annoying modern music.3)Elijah's frequently shirtless. Elijah spends most of the movie looking concerned,and widening his eyes. *SPOILER ALERT*The movie ends with him giving a blank,bland look. Thank goodness Elijah is frequently shirtless,even has a shower scene--to distract from his bland acting. In a touch of irony,there's a scene set at the Eagle and Child--the pub hangout of JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis.""The Oxford Murders"" is so bad,it's good. As some tripsters listen to Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"" while watching the Wizard of Oz,one could sync the music of the Davis-based psychedelic rock band Oxford CircleLive at the Avalonwith this movie. ""Oxford Murders"" is a magical mystery tour,a camp classic."
Wish I could say the same for the acting. Elijah Wood sounded like he was in a high school production. His lameness colored the entire production.
"THE OXFORD MURDERS (2007, U.S. release 2010, dir. Alex de la Iglesia, based on the Argentinean novelCrimenes Imperceptibles (Spanish Edition), ""Imperceptible Crimes"" by Guillermo Martinez). This cheesy made-for-television murder mystery is one of those all-too-arrogant, in-your-face, fall-down-silly errors that usually make audiences laugh in all the wrong places. Mission accomplished.Elijah Wood plays Martin, a mathematical prodigy (you couldn't tell from seeing this) who travels to study at Oxford under the great Professor Seldom (a brilliant, diabolical John Hurt). With some compelling music and cinematography that is a direct nod to Alfred Hitchcock - NOT to Brian De Palma as is commonly misstated - this is more like bad American 1980s TV than anything else.Aside from the endlessly stupid intellectual goofs in the mathematics and physics theorems referenced in the script (Fermat's Theorem is called ""Bormat"" or ""Doormat"" or something; the number pi is confused with the lesser-known number phi), there is little to commend this thing. The usual gross-out sex scene (even worse as half of 'the team' is Elijah) angered me as per usual. Eurotrash at its finest: with the help of a once-admired American falling star.What is saddest of all is the story is quite compelling, the villains are actually numerous - and not entirely evil. The real villain(s) will never be quite whom you suspect. One villain is idiotically exposed at the beginning of the film, but it doesn't end with her. What I think is wonderful is the question this movie puts to us: is crime and villainy a driven act of desperation on the part of an otherwise innocent person?As a murder mystery and as Anglophile-bait, it's mediocre. As a general film it is all too reminiscent of shows such as ""Foyle's War"" (believe it or not), ""NCIS"" and ""NUMB3RS"". It takes too many cues from other silly things such as THE DAVINCI CODE. The London Police cooperating fully with, even relying on, a weirdo student and a math professor in a major crime series? An American nobody kid allowed free run and access to crime scene photos? Are they kidding me??Michael Caine and Jeremy Irons were both offered the role of Professor Seldom, and wisely refused. John Hurt can always afford to dumpster-dive in a thing like this and take it in his stride; Elijah Wood cannot, and this is one of a string of proofs that Wood's career is finished. A solid ten minutes of absolute yuck sex between Elijah and a buxom beauty (just to remind us how straight he is) - that is the red flag of the ages. It's all part of the ultimate sadness of bad film and lost careers.Cry for this, Argentina! - the rest of the world may join in as desired."
I did not enjoy this movie at all.  It was boring from beginning to end.  Not worth watching.  Pass it up.
Did not care for the story line.  The series was too far out to be realistic.  Just not my kind of movie.
"I thought I was really going to like this movie and was very disappointed.  Right away in the beginning there were so many things that were just unbelievable.  Very shallow, just plain not good."
"THE OXFORD MURDERS is typical British cinema--cerebral, pondering and tedious.  While BBC's WAKING THE DEAD is excellent, this movie doesn't compare on any level.An interesting mystery is shrouded with mathematical mumbo jumbo which rises above the average viewer's knowledge or interest (like TV's NUMB3RS).LOTR's Elijah Wood uses his soulful eyes and little else in his wooden performance; John Hurt is excellent as always, and Julie Cox chews up the scenery.The movie's twist ending is surprising but gets anti-climactic execution.Primarily, it's just all rather boring."
"Given the caliber of actors in this, I am so very surprised at how bad the acting actually is. I cant say if it's bad directing or what, but truly unfortunate performances all around."
"None of the characters appealed to me, and the mystery was more drama than anything else.  I think the writer was trying to be &#34;deep&#34; but it ended up just dark..."
"It's a snobbish clich&eacute; to pronounce the book on which any film material was based as being much better than the film. But in this case, I'm not trying to demonstrate my literacy with the recommendation. It's my sincere opinion.This movie just doesn't make the grade. It graduates from the merely pedantic to the completely far-fetched. Like the book, it posits a serial killer who is playing abstruse mathematical games with Professor Seldom and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; at Oxford's Mathematical Institute. However, the film throws in all sorts of extra glancing mathematical references - to Fermat's Last Theorem, to Fibonacci's series, and to chaos theory. A lot of these references don't exist in the book or else are more integral aspects of the book. So the movie is like a Koosh ball, sprouting all sorts of alien little rubbery protrusions that make it briefly tantalizing, but that ultimately just cause it to come off as silly.The movie reminds me of Tom Stoppard's play ""Arcadia."" While that play was acclaimed, when you thought about it logically, you realized that all its talk about chaos theory was completely adventitious and unnecessary.There are other problems with this movie. Scenes that were treated more realistically in the book become grotesqueries in the movie. The film tries to combine the most garish elements of ""The DaVinci Code,"" a CSI episode, and ""The Zodiac Killer.""Whereas in the book, the protagonist's Russian roommate is just a normal person, in the movie he is portrayed by an actor who inexplicably chews up the scenery like a rabid dog. In the book, Seldom's former eccentric, obsessed colleague is indeed a hopeless case in the extended care ward of a hospital; but in the movie the man is presented as a shocking mutilation of a figure. In the book, Seldom is an average-looking 50-year-old professor; in the movie he is played by John Hurt whose already world-weary face is photographed as ravaged superannuation. The book's brief, innocent sex scenes become rawly carnal in the film. In the book, inappropriate romances that are barely suggested or suspected are made explicit and decisive in the film. The film also adds a further twist ending to the solution of the murders that is sort of interesting and integrating, but that ultimately makes a triangle with 190 degrees of all the antecedent action.Not that the book is perfect. Author Guillermo Martinez failed to adequately explain a key puzzle and carelessly leaves some dangling plot points. But the book is more satisfyingly grounded than this hodgepodge of a film. This is one class you should definitely cut."
Very pedestrian. Not very interesting. Gave it up after first two episodes. Don't recommend it. Watch something else. Not very good.
"Premise not totally believable but I'll go with the fantasy but silly, tired, NCIS cute crap, turned me off. Seems the Brits make better spy TV shows."
"Listened to the authors, directors, etc., and from what they were saying they wanted to achieve - well, perhaps they over intellectualized it.  Clearly a farce - caught in a trap?  no problem, just fade out to a new scene.  Get in a fight, get thrown around?  no problem, you arise without a scratch or your hair out of shape.  C, mon, get real!"
"I found the lead character insufferably cliched, as were most of the others.  The only thing I liked was the plot twist, but I figured it out just before it was revealed in the show.  Won't be going back to this one.  Your mileage may vary, as they say."
Sometimes a little slow on the stroy-- cant always &#34;like&#34; the charactersThe story lines are sometime slow & then predictable
"This is a light weight but pleasant way too spend some down time. The thing I like most was that the episodes don't end with a car chase or a gun battle, just the killer being knapped.  Kind of nice to see Florida scenery."
"I really would like to watch at least one episode of this, but in my haste to get it, I forgot to check to see if it was closed-captioned. It's not.  So I can't give a review of it."
I could only some much stand the commentary and then decided to turn it off. The cast of Mystery Science Fiction Theatre is good to a point but then ruined the movie.
"Very humerous as expected, but a little flat at times.  Dawn French's character was way too over the top as usual.  that's the main reason I couldn't make it through all of the episodes."
"I did watch all six episodes, and I probably will watch more if they make more. That main scientist shown in the picture is very annoying, I must say. As viewers we are somehow expected to believe that he knows more than he's revealing, but he just seems to be too contrived. The show reminds me somewhat of Flash Forward, but it doesn't come close in quality or scope."
"The premise of this program is simplistic and the writers don't do much with it.  A bunch of cops are given a few fragmentary, confusing clues about a crime, or something, in advance, and they have to figure out what the clues mean and stop the bad thing from happening.  Only instead of getting these clues from a medium or a psychic of some kind, these images get downloaded mysteriously from outer space.  The writer's don't do much of anything interesting with this idea.The characters are also poorly developed. The dialogue is mediocre at best. Bad British writers love to have their characters yell and scream and browbeat and insult each other and behave like incredibly annoying jerks.  There is a fair amount of that in this series.I had high hopes initially and looked forward to watching the episodes I bought. But after wading through four episodes, I am not at all surprised that the series was canceled after only 5 episodes. I would have canceled it myself."
"I wanted this show to work..it has a good premise for some nail-biting moments, but the characters are all a bit ordinary. No one compelling role that drives you back to watch the next show.Quite disappointed actually. Acting not up to the usual standards of British TV and although the lead guy is decent, he is a little too low-key to work the &#34;drama&#34; in the show"
"This show has one interesting character. The rest are freaking boring, which is a shame because the premise is pretty cool. Why cast such uninteresting actors? And why are the characters so poorly written? The plot line is quality work, but for what is basically supposed to be a police procedural the &#34;cops&#34; spend half of every episode complaining, and the other half fighting and sulking. The  lead cop brings her ex onto the team, who sits through most of the pilot. (Sulking.) Then in a later episode they have a fight about her keeping things from him and for the rest of that episode he sulks and ignores her calls.(The calls of the lead investigator during a case involving the possible murder of a woman.) Because he is her ex she does not have him removed from the team, but tries to make up. So very irritating. I keep wanting to shout at the characters to grow the f up."
"The concept is engaging--a scientist receives warnings from somewhere in space that catastrophic events are going to occur and a team of police and scientists set about attempting to divert these catastrophes from happening--with varying success.  The series would be more compelling if there were a gradual unravelling of the mystery behind the signals.  This is a single, plot-line show where a dual plot line--one that reveals an alternate reality beyond what is happening in real time--would have provided depth and thought-provoking meaning for audiences.  The female protagonist is excellent.  The brooding male scientist comes off a bit creepy instead of troubled as he is meant to be, I believe.  If you want something border-line sci-fi and still engaging, try Warehouse 13, Touched, or 666 Park Avenue."
"I love Sci-Fi and this is not it.  Silly not campy, and not nearly enough science.  Ugh!  I sure hope they're not making a season 2."
Just a little too dark to continue to watch.  The first one was okay but then the 2nd and 3rd one were just too depressing.  Too much psycho babble and know why it's called touching evil
"It's said the director insisted on shooting this on site and away from any green screens. He should have been more concerned about realism. First, no legion general would go down a narrow road in the mist (or otherwise) without thoroughly scouting it out beforehand. Rome didn't become the military power it did by being ambushed so easily. In the days of Agustus, three legions were ambushed along a narrow, wooded trail in Britain, but there was no way to scout it out beforehand. In fact, the general leading these legions reached a clearing and was on his way back, knowing he had made a grave tactical error and that he couldn't reverse it. The Romans were a fearsome fighting force and small numbers of them routinely decimated much larger armies. The Brits loved to rush in and scare opposing armies by fearful shrieks, which didn't work against highly disciplined soldiers who had fought in many different campaigns from Parthia to Africa and even Germany. Look what happened to Boudica, with an army of 100,000 men when they threw themselves against just one trained legion which waited in a narrow detente uphill and situated between two treelines. Governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus was actually criticized for taking too many lives -- but it saved Nero from having to retreat from Britain altogether. It's true that Rome caused most of its own problems by its brutality, and they did suffer losses, but not by waltzing down narrow roads in thick fog with no trained scouts to precede them. And BTW, if &#34;the witch&#34; knew about Etan's identity, reputation and the reason for not being able to speak, chaces are the Romans would have known.Finally, the Romans didn't have to kill the Centurion if they wanted to keep the 9th Legion's fate secret. If so, they would have had to kill all the soldiers in the room, as well as the slaves. And if they did want him dead, all they would have had to do was order him to report to the govenor and arrest him. Or, they could have always poisoned his wine. Attacked from behind in a relaxed and physically drained state, and having him kill both...I want my money back! Save this one for the five-dollar bin, then don't buy it. I'll never get the time I wasted on this nonsense.If you want to see a good Roman flick, see GLADIATOR again. Still not very plausible, but well done. Plus there were tigers. And green screens. Thank God for green screens, tigers and New Zealand!  And my recommendation to the Romans is, if you cut someone's tongue out, don't hire them as your primary scout!"
"This review contains MINOR SPOILERS. The biggest problem in the logic with this movie is that it asks you to empathize with the Romans, after establishing that they are the imperialist invaders, crushing the native Picts by any means necessary, and delighting in their torment. At one point, they even murder a child, and you're STILL supposed to empathize with them. One of the primary ""villains"" of this movie is a woman who was brutalized, had her tongue cut out, and watched her family get murdered before her. Yet, she's not the character that the filmmaker chooses to create empathy with- nope, he chooses the Roman who's trying to escape her justice.It's also hard to lose yourself in the movie when there are jarring inconsistencies that were included either as an appeal to juvenile sensibilities, or as the result of some writing that's so lazy it borders on the incomprehensible. As an example of the former problem, every woman who appears in ""Centurion"" looks like a supermodel who just waltzed out of a dressing room where she was pampered by professional hair dressers and makeup artists. I don't know about you, but I find this pretty amusing, when the women in question are barbarian-hunters riding around on horseback, or an exiled witch living out in the middle of the woods. This glaring contrast takes me out of the fiction that has been created on screen, and makes me consider what was going on in the director's head as he issued his orders to the wardrobe department.As an example of the latter problem (lazy writing), there is one scene that is so absurd, it completely takes you out of the movie. It is established that the Pict tracker has such advanced abilities that she can detect the presence of her quarry a quarter mile away, simply because she's downwind from them. That's a bit silly, but I'm okay with that. What makes it absurd is that just a few minutes later, she walks into a small hut where all three of the men she is tracking are hiding. Yet, despite the fact that they are only a few feet away, she cannot detect them. Never mind the fact that they had only a couple of minutes to hide, and they're sweating profusely and bleeding all over the place- nope, our superhuman tracker is completely baffled. What's the explanation? It's simple- the producers painted themselves into a corner and they were too lazy to create a feasible solution.On the positive side, this movie does contain some great geography, striking cinematography, and good choreography (although the gore is over the top, and again directed at juvenile sensibilites)."
"couldn't hold my attention, overuse of graphic violence killed the storyline which might have been good given the era of the story"
"Weak story line.  Cinematography was poor.  Sets,make up costumes none were well done.  It was a cheaply made movie.  And I love a good show that tells stories of times long ago.  This is no &#34;Rome&#34; by HBO"
After watching the preview for this film I thought it looked promising.  It turns out to be rather typical and generally disappointing.  It's really just a bunch of fight scenes broken up by A LOT of running.  There's really not much of a plot.  If you're interested in watching this movie I would just save yourself the $7 and read one or two of the favorable reviews; you will get at least as much storyline as the movie gives.  This is one of those movies that looks like it could have been good but it just fell short.  Don't waste your money.
"I watched perhaps 20 minutes of this movie because I like Michael Fassbender as an actor. Surely he wouldn't choose a second rate role in a second rate movie I thought. I was wrong. Though if you like a movie full of sword swinging but very little artistic irony and a predictable plot line you may like this one. For me however, after watching a little bit if this celluloid disappointment I gave up and clicked remove from list."
I watched it to the end. Who ever wrote this had no insite into human behavior. The blond was good looking had a presence. And beat Hilary in acting but that was not saying much. the story line was extremely weak. The blond should have knowin his big mouth friend was talking. there was no other way they would know about him. I mean there are a hell of a lot of blond men with pony tails. lol And he had a big mouth. I also noticed that he had no gun shot wound in the pool scean > Bad writing Bad directing. And the minute a bad guy came on the scean you knew he was bad. The only knowen people where the bad guys as usual in a bad movie.
"To be honest the show is not half bad, I only watch because it's free with my prime and it is not like I am not doing something also just to catch up with episodes. I started watching on a very early Sunday morning when the house still quiet and since I am a sucker for cop and medical shows I gave it a shot. The acting is ok, the story lines are ok and the cast is also ok. Nothing to write home about but entertaining for a free, no suspence, easy going cop show and the main charachter is good to look at. :)"
"But I'm not among them, especially.  The acting was very creditable, and I enjoy dramas that play out in small spaces with few characters.  But in this case, none of the characters was likeable enough for me to care what happened to him or her.  There is no way to say anything more about this movie without massive spoilers, so be warned.The suspense of the story depends largely on the rate of revelation attached to our learning the interrelationships among key characters.  Throughout the course of the story, we find out that not only is Alice romantically attached to one of the kidnappers, but that the two (male) kidnappers are romantically attached to each other.  That puts one kidnapper as a pretty interesting corner of a triangle, and makes him pivotal to how the story eventually unfolds.There is a relatively high ""ick"" factor with a not-unrealistic (but not terribly welcome) focus on toilet functions, vomit, and awkward sex (and no, I don't mean the men kissing, although I'm sure some would include that on an ""ick factor list"" as well).  All the action that takes place within the kidnapper's hideout seem completely realistic and natural, but once the locations start changing, it becomes hard to believe that events play out as they do.  People do not seem to die, for example, until their full dramatic potential has been reached, which might make for all right entertainment, but in a story set apart by its attention to verisimilitude, it does strain credulity to the snapping point.I feel compelled to mention one aspect of the movie that was well, well above the standards for most thrillers of this type (even the artier thrillers), and that's the music, which was perfectly complementary, unobtrusive, but powerfully effective in evoking the appropriate feelings of excitement, stress, dread, and relief.If you like Hitchcock-style suspense and stories that turn very much of characters and relationships, there is much to like in ""Alice Creed.""  For my part, I did not find the ultimate destination much worth the travel...but then, I never found Alice a very sympathetic character."
"Before deeming this review as unhelpful, I just want you to listen to what I have to say regarding this television program. And it is not COMPLETELY bad; it is more tolerable than a lot of the other stupid children's series out nowadays, so that is why I gave it an extra star. However, the humor is not the best.This is one of those programs featuring characters (particularly Otis more than anyone else) who are quite dim with bouts of cockiness and conceit that are very irritating. Sometimes that can be a good thing, but this series doesn't do a good job of portraying that in a funny way. And he does get his comeuppances frequently after having someone else top him, but often through predictable but ridiculous changes or circumstances or idiotic plot twists. The characters are either dimwitted, cocky, saucy, or all of the above either simultaneously or during certain situations, and in a way that is intended to tickle viewers' funny bones but is so dumb that it fails. Many characters are so moronically-obnoxious that it's infuriating rather than entertaining. A shining example of one of these characters is Snotty Boy, who the writers try so hard to depict as obnoxious and bratty that they overdo it on his personality, and he comes off as so annoying and idiotic that it's really not that funny. That is the thing about this show: when they try to portray particular characters a certain way, they over-dramatize the qualities that make them appear that way (i.e. charitable, sweet, feminine) to such a degree that it's just downright stupid rather than laughable, like how they're intending. (for example, a character with an overly- sweet personality would sound like this: ""I'll go pick flowers and frolic through the meadows riding on a unicorn's back"" in those exact words. No character has used those exact lines, I believe, but often very similar ones. It's supposed to be humorous, but it is so stupid that it is not). There's a good degree to over-dramatize things and a bad one in comedy. If you go to the bad one, then it makes things seem stupid.Sorry that this review is so long. It is just difficult to describe what makes this program so moronic, in my opinion. If you are unfamiliar with the series and have not ever really seen an episode before, go online and watch a few for yourself and you'll see what I mean. It is tough to explain things without far too many exact quotations. And take the words of my review to heart while watching an episode, too. Then you will be able to understand things better. But please do not deem me as unhelpful right away without very good reason."
the show is to noisey and each episode is really the same if you have seen one show you have basicly seen them all
While a  pretty period piece the pace is so slow interest fades fast. Can't figure out how this could have run for two seasons.
This series follows the tradition of off-setting the less appealing consequences of the modernization of rural towns and villages with copious drafts of traditional &#34;wisdom&#34; and &#34;old-fashioned common sense.&#34; And there is no villager more &#34;saintly&#34; in imparting both the latter than the yeoman played by Brendan Coyle. Unfortunately the tensions created by modernity are all too familiar to most viewers hence the series struggles to maintain sufficient tension for us to care about the outcomes.
"couldn't watch it for long.  Bad acting does not do it for me.  I like good direction and really good acting.  I do not really like method acting -being oneself just saying the words.  This is not acting.  however, even with method acting this episode failed miserably."
I thought this was a series and didn't realize it was a reality show.  For some this might be entertainment but not for me.
"There is a big difference when you watch masterpieces like The Walking Dead, Sons of Anarchy, etc., and this below par, Hollywood Formula, that from the script to the acting, to the editing of the already mediocre series, all it spells for the watcher is: ""I have no life at all, I rather watch the crappy premise of the show, than to participate in more meaningful activities.""2 Not so shinning stars."
"This episode is incredibly ludicrous.  The showdown features 1 Apache helicopter that takes about ten minutes to destroy two out of three bus's , get real...  There would have been half a dozen Apache's, and the game would have been over in seconds....  I can't believe anyone writing this would seriously believe that's the way it works, lol!!!!!  If you are going to use the military as part of your show, you need to hire a military adviser.  This is a cartoon.  The only reason I gave it three stars is because the acting was, for the most part good, effects not too bad, and the storyline could have been great, but really fell short."
there wasn't anything that made me have any empathy for the victims. just a bunch of whiny people mad because their less than stellar behavior reaped bad results. welcome to the real world---oh and it does rain in southern California.
"you are led to think you will be seeing the movie instead yousee some people sitting around talking about the move, whocares."
"The movie was half done before I ever saw one of the &#34;creatures&#34; they'd referred to only about twice by then.  Very boring.  The ending left me wondering, what was the point of the whole movie.  I didn't get it at all."
"This movie is clearly intended to be a commentary on American's fear of Mexicans, with a particular slant arguing for the irrationality of this position.  I'm tired of having movies and media tell me how I should feel about this issue.  I'm even more tired of the attempt to cloak social and political commentary within a movie that's seemingly about conventional aliens.  District 9 was at least a highly engaging film.  I know Americans as a lot tend to expect fast paced, action-filled films, but we do and so what? Right wrong or indifferent, Americans' general preferences align to these core values, with some exceptions here and there.  This film, unfortunately, doesn't fulfill.  While I appreciate its attempt to allegorically demonstrate the irrationality of Americans' core xenophobia, I'm sick of the message. Further, good satire, ironic or otherwise, derives its value from being a compelling story on multiple levels, including the simplistic, face-value story presented, through its underlying messages.  This movie is just not that interesting on its face value/level. It does a good job of making the key actors interesting and relatable to the audience, but their journey is much more matter of fact and devoid of conflict, that is just drags on without eliciting the emotional response the film clearly thinks it should drag out.  This is my principal complaint - the actual on-screen action is widely disconnected from the message the story seems to be trying to convey.  I must say, however, that if you're renting this film, you'll likely not regret your decision, but if you buy, this will either end up on your ebay to sell list, or collect dust."
"For a film with so much buzz, especially for its director and his bag of tricks, `Monsters' is disturbingly ineffective.  I should have listened to my Ammy buddy MKIA, but then again, even he said I may like this.  I wanted to.  While heavily clich&eacute;d, I just wanted this to scare the pants off of me, and we all know that atmosphere is the scariest thing of all; and this film supposedly had a lot of that.It doesn't.Okay, so the film takes place at a time when alien life forms are terrorizing humans.  These gigantic squid like things have been contained in Mexico by a gigantic wall that runs along the Mexican border.  A young photographer is in Mexico chasing after his big break when his plans are derailed by a sudden attack and the need to escort a young woman back to the States (that young woman happens to be the daughter of the photographer's boss).  Their journey back to the States is littered with oddly placed emotional connections and a few scattered attempts to scare us with brief glimpses of alien creatures.Take away the fact that this monster film hardly showcases the actual monsters; the film itself had major promise.  I mean, I'm all for a film about emotional growth and human bonding in the times of trial.  The script itself, while heavily clich&eacute;d, could have really proven deeply arresting, and the final scene is expertly handled (and by final scene I mean just that; the split second before the credits begin to roll).  Still, there are two things that really prohibited this movie from being any good; Scoot McNairy and Whitney Able.  These two actors are atrocious.  I mean, they probably put in the worst performances of the year; period.  There is no chemistry, and the dialog they have to suffer through is horrendous.  I know that this film was done on a small budget, which actually says a lot for the crispness of the scenes (the cinematography is especially marvelous) but you can feel an air of `cheapness' in a lot of the voice over work (I don't know if the sound wasn't good on the original shoot and so they basically dubbed all the dialog, but there are many scenes where the crispness of the vocals is distracting and phony sounding).The `scary' moments are few and far in between, but they are effective to a degree.  The opening scene is pretty great and got my hopes up very high, but in the end `Monsters' barely registers with the viewer save for some beautiful cinematic shots and a shivery score."
"I have issues with monster movies where the female lead is always dressed and looking sexy tousled, her hair and face just so, even as she sweats her way from one near-death to another. That was the funny part for me. I laughed. There is no chemistry between these two as they try to make their way home to the US from the alien-infected jungles of Mexico. Yes, the movie tries to make a social commentary about immigration and keeping the Mexicans out. Here, a huge wall is there to keep the aliens out, unsuccessfully, it turns out. I'll credit the film with not overdoing the scares. There is more threat of scare than actual scare. The aliens looks like giant shrimp, and while not entirely believable, they look okay for cheap special effects. The other effects are better, such as the wreckage left behind where the aliens have been rampaging. The script stinks, and the two lead actors are bad. Should you watch? Maybe. Just don't expect much."
"Realistic characters, understated dialog, good cinematography and special effects all come up short in what appears to be an off-hand statement on current American Immigration Policies and the demographic shift in the southwest. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the best parts. Disappointed not only with the money spent to rent it but the lost opportunity to make a genuine monster movie.  Watch Cloverfield or Alien Raiders instead."
The storyline & premise had the potential to be really interesting but to me it was a rambling movie that was hard to track the intent of the characters and the bordering countries. Also the monster's seemed to have their own agenda but that wasn't clearly defined. Not a fan of the production values or editing either.
"i watched this because the director is behind the new Godzilla movie. This movie has a lot going for it: nice directing, it's beautifully filmed, great cinematography, creative settings/backgrounds, excellent use of the aliens  - goes to show that 100+ million dollars is not necessary. BUT, it just plods along. it is not about smash and destroy aliens - they serve as the push for the interactions of the 2 lead characters and that is fine - i had no trouble with that. what i did have trouble with was it moved so slowly with little if any character development - i never really learned anything more about these people. and 80 minutes into it i just didnt care, then poof 5 minutes of intrigue and THE END. as a prime member, try it, but don;t pay for it."
"I watched this because I was in the mood for an alien movie. This is 95% about a man and a woman who gradually fall in love, amid a journey from Central America to the US border, made difficult because of travel restrictions due to an alien invasion.  I'm making it sound better than it is.  For one thing, a lot of Spanish is spoken, with very little translation. For another, this felt more like a three-hour movie, with the man and woman gazing at each other, alternating with looking out for the monsters, who conveniently only appear in the dark. There's about five minutes of monster activity, not counting the ending.  There's even a &#34;War of the Worlds&#34; (the one with Tom Cruise) ripoff scene with monster tentacles investigating a building while the woman tries to be quiet. Things happen with no explanation or purpose for the story.  What a waste of time and what a misleading title."
Story had no suspense.  Direction was not entertaining.  A dud.  Don't waste your time.  I couldn't watch it.  A dud.
THE MOVIE WAS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. TO ME IT WAS MORE  A LOVE STORY.  THERE WAS SOME INTERSTING SIGHTS. BUT ALL IN ALL NOT MY KNID OF A MOVIE.
"I gave it 2 stars because I liked the concept -- alien life purposely brought back to Earth, accidentally let loose -- so I decided to give it a go.  So not worth it. Nothing happens.  Nothing.  It is boring.  No, let me correct that.  It is BOOOOOORING!!!!  Way too many areas of the plot left unexplored; way too much meaningless conversation that does nothing to advance the plot; way too little character development; way too many unanswered questions; and the &#34;plot twist&#34; at the end was incomplete."
"So, the monsters are giant, walking, glowing, octopus, from outer space, and towards the end of the film you get to see them have sex. Oh no, I am not kidding. Despite its original title and awful special effects, Monsters, is not a bad story. It is however another example of a writer, using science fiction, to promote his own agenda and bigotry. The infected zone is Mexico and you're safe once you get to America. How about the largest man made structure in the world? A wall to keep the aliens out of the USA. As for the acting, it was two newcomers who actually were pretty good, but whom are easily overlooked. It's because Monsters is one of those movies, where you keep waiting for something to happen and it never does. It had good potential, but was just painfully boring...unless of course you enjoy octopus sex."
"When this TV series keeps the action where it should be, i.e. on the Destiny, and in space it is a 4 or 5 star showUnfortunately, this episode spent half the time on earth showing the domestic issues that a couple people had."
"If your used to SG1 you'll find this really slow moving, it just doesn't have that adventure spirit it had."
I don't like that Amazon charges me a monthly charge and yet I am not able to watch streamed shows that I expected to be able to watch with the my monthly subscription.
"This gives procedural dramas a bad name. If you're expecting something akin to Law and Order, you aren't going to get it here. Basically it is mundane and repetitive in the worst way. The way the storylines are annoying because it goes back and forth showing the prosecutor's side of the story and the defense's side. Plus there is no police investigation of the crimes.Bad formatting, storylines have been done to death on other shows, predictable endings. All around it could have been so much better but whoever came up with the scripts and format is an idiot. I only gave it a chance and watched a bit because I like Maura Tierney."
excellent acting but do not like such fast moving dialogue and switching back and forth between different scenarios.  looked like excellent story line though.
"This is for the Episode One Night.This entire series just barely holds my interest. it has just the bare minimum of explanatory material to take it to a high school mentality level, for those in high school,  instead of a 6th grade mentality. However, episodes like this one are lazy writing, inane, and intellectually annoying.So, Will and his new girlfriend (Abby) are accosted by gang members in order to save their leader's life. The writers of the episode couldn't think of anything else, so they wrote in the leverage that if Will didn't save the gang leader, the second in command would kill both of them. Really?So let me get this straight. The second in command, wanting the leader to be saved by Will, threatens to kill Will, if Will doesn't save the leader? I mean it looks like she doesn't have any leverage at all. Will could simply say he wants this or that (safe passage after the fact, for instance) or she might as well shoot the leader herself, since that's the logical outcome. (The second in command wanted Will to kill the leader by making it look like an accident, but she still had to make it look that way. Killing Will remains an illogical way to achieve that end., and so the evaluation I offer is valid.)What's more, the gang will probably kill them anyway (Will and Abby deduce this). So, in fact, the second in command has no leverage at all.In the mean time, Will concocts  a plan whereby Abby gets free, and while free the first thing Will instructs her to do is call Sanctuary. Abby does get free, and runs back to Will. Her explanation is that she didn't want them to kill Will because she escaped. Again, if they kill Will, their leader dies. Two things here: (1) Why can't she make a simple 20 second call to Sanctuary before coming back and (2) Killing Will is the same as killing the leader, so until all avenues of Will saving the leader's life are exhausted, Will is safe.Very poor deductive thinking and thus poor writing. Of course if you're a sixth grader with limited mental capability, you probably won't notice the fallacy. For the rest of us, we do, and I won't be purchasing the next season. I purchased the entire 3rd season, so I will probably finish it. But then is see ya to bad writing and an insult to average intelligence."
"Criminals able to talk about their crimes is not interesting. I enjoy the forensic part of the ID shows, not the emotional story of a criminal."
I often have to watch what my child is watching and usually its entertaining but this was like torture.  It was so boring I was very glad it stopped after 4 episodes.
"Not a great film by any means. It is, in fact, the same old cliche' based on true events story. It doesn't really go anywhere. The characters, all of them, except the dog were flat and boring. Actually, the dog was pretty flat too. Based on the film, the marriage was doomed from the beginning and only got worse, but I didn't feel anything for any of the characters. The story and it's depiction was just sad and pathetic. But maybe that was the point."
"Swamp People was an ok show. I chose to watch this show after seeing it pop up as a recommendation here on Amazon. I love the show Mountain Men and I love the show Duck Dynasty and Swamp people seems to try to capture some of the same feelings from these shows. You have the &#34;redneck&#34; feel from Duck Dynasty and the &#34;tough guy&#34; feeling from Mountain Men. While it was definitely interesting to get a peek into the unique lives of the people on this show, I didnt feel like any of the characters really had that appeal or charm that a reality show needs to keep viewers interested. Plus, there are really only so many times one can watch people catch crocodiles in a swamp. &#34;Meh&#34; is my overall opinion of this show. I wouldn't recommend it or choose it again."
"What a disappointment! I was an avid Nova viewer 10 years ago so thought I'd give it a try. It has changed from a serious program for intellectually curious adults into a program for school-aged children. Even the narration has changed from a serious, deep, masculine voice to a metrosexual male with a non-threatening, elementary school teacher's speaking style."
"Watched this expecting some decent acting and some decent action, not because of the user reviews but because of the stock Amazon review, but all I got were some pointless brutal killings over small potatoes. The so-called &#34;great reviews&#34; are also misleading. You probably might watch it anyway, to see for yourself, but believe me, you'll wish you had that time back. This film is boring, has a convoluted storyline and seems pretty disjointed. All in all, a waste of time. Really, just a story of different mobsters jockeying for position and pointlessly and carelessly beating and killing everyone and each other along the way. But don't expect any martial arts, there isn't any. There's some bitch-slapping, some beatings (that you don't really see all that well), too many point-blank gunshots, stilted dialog. In this film, everyone is corrupt, even the cops. Predictably boring finale as well. Just a bunch of grown men acting like punks. Pass this one by."
"A fair amount of well executed (so to speak) violence in a well made but routine yakuza film. Takeshi Kitano makes so many movies they can't all be great. This one isn't - but it's not terribly bad, either."
"This is your typical organized crime film where competing families play &#34;King of the Hill.&#34; You get the feeling of deja vu when you watch it.It includes, paid off cops, hits, drugs, prostitution, betrayals and an odd scene where they force the ambassador of Ghana to open a casino in his embassy. This film doesn't bring anything new to the table, except the Japanese &#34;honorably&#34; cut off their own finger rather than have someone else do it to them. With the film being run of the mill crime action, the English subtitles was a big negative as it was apparent they were lazy and didn't translate everything.Parental Guide: F-bomb, token sex and nude scene."
It's been a while since I viewed the program but it is deceptive in that a family was supposed to have found these documents in an attic and there is no info on what they thought or who they gave the docs to except for a very short mention somewhere in the program. I think the story was with this family; did they lose any family members to the death camps?  A repeat of what went on in the death camps is really getting to be old stuff.  The story needs to be redefined so the young generation of people we have now on the planet know what really happened.
"Story made no sense, the writing was terrible, the dialog was wooden, and the monsters(Snowmen) were silly. I do like Clara, interesting character, and I like the new TARDIS.  I wish Steven Moffit would explain more about the Lizard woman, their are too many questions about her character. I mean really a Lizard woman walking around 1892 London and no one says anything or is trying to hunt her down, the only one who was realistic was the Maid who fainted."
"Boy meets girl.  Each is on the wrong side of the tracks for the other.  Things get passionate though a number of details seem out of character for each.  Enough it kept this from seeming plausible really.  Plot is too thin, and story is too choppy.  The middle and ending seem very poorly worked out.  Like someone just gave up rather than finish the story.  I have seen worse, but this one ends up moving too slowly and tepidly.  This could have been a riveting, moving, and important story.  It unfortunately just was not."
I don't think this film is worth the cost.  It moved too slowly and never captured my attention or interest.  Something was lacking in this film.  I don't think it is worth the cost.  See more at vyctoryab dot wix dot com slash xplr.
i love anjelina jolie- she is a great actress and she was in the movie- i didnt read the whole description and its not the movie salt so really disappointed
that it was the movie it was only a clip an run for only a few seconds and ended quick
"There was a lot of action, as well as twist and turns. Angelina Jolie is a tough ass, as usual, but while salt was definitely entertaining to watch, the storyline was a dry, done, and out-dated. I mean Russian spies in 2010?!? Come on... It left a lot to be desired."
I feel compelled to watch it because it is so bad. The theories have more holes than swiss cheese and the &#34;authorities&#34; have no credentials whatsoever. It is like the campiest thing ever filmed.
"This is quite a departure for what we used to know as History Channel programming.  I am open to new ideas, but this series often goes so far off the deep end as to be unwatchable."
"I love Dr. Who and I really am an avid anime fan, I tried this on a whim but the stop motion choppiness and the audio matching was just too horrible.  If someone were to fix the animation it might be fine but the hole is too big as it is now. Now to mention the quick wrap up of the plot line, it was extremely rough holding it together in parts and the ending was just too rushed. Perhaps this is a nice experiment? I say keep experimenting, this could have some potential, but you need to get better from here, just a quick point or no-one is going to watch further episodes."
"I may sound harsh during this brief review, but I feel that this show does not deserve praise in any way.  I watched the first 2 episodes and was bored the entire time.  Well, I wasn't bored, because I was laughing at the terrible dialogue.  Kids shouldn't even watch this.  It would rot their brains.  It is that stupid.That said, the show has some funny moments and a few good characters.  I question why someone would act the way they do in this show, but if you overlook the bad acting and terrible writing, it has some small hint of merit.  It has an interesting theme, which is a British private school with lots of mysterious disappearances.  They could have explored the disappearances from a more scary or eerie perspective, but the writers apparently do not want to freak out the kids.  Give kids more credit!  My 13-year-old brother has watched horror flicks all his life.  He would never watch this show.Now, I must admit that I was tempted to just skip a few episodes and go straight to the end of the first season.  It may be one of those shows that gets better in later seasons.  I honestly have no idea, because I lost interest after 2 horrible episodes."
I just cannot get into this! I thought it would be as funny as the Simpsons and Family Guy but I just couldn't get into it.
"I SAW this lame movie in  pre-screen in HD-MOVIESBah, where to begin? The film starts off strong with a good scary set up, but the story of mass disappearances of people when they are in darkness goes nowhere. We waited all 90 minutes for some explanation; even some guesses by the remaining few who have found one another, but none came. The characters are completely uninspired and even when they learn that they will die if it goes dark, they dont take even the most basic steps to survive (candles? gas lamps?). Frustrating, as this could have been an interesting movie, even scary, but its as if the writer & director had an idea for a piece of a movie, but never developed the plot. Its ninety minutes of whispers I exist and dark shadow creeping up on people to take them away and pretty much nothing else.  i recommend as just STUPID & WASTED MY TIME!!!!!  D"
"I initially watched this movie because the general storyline seemed to hold some promise. Once started I continued to watch the movie hoping that eventually something would happen that would pull it all together; I was, however, doomed to disappointment as nothing ever came to its rescue. The movie just plods along with darkness threatening and people disappearing with no effort at an explanation or resolution.It has an interesting premise where people disappear and leave clothes, shoes, glasses, jewelry and false teeth behind but the implementation of that premise is a sorry disappointment, the devil is in the details. One keeps hoping that some sort of reason will be revealed but that never happens. The problem, whatever it might be, involves not only 7th Street but all of Detroit.As a Christian I see the resemblance to the Christian doctrine of the Rapture of the Church but whereas this doctrine has a cause and an explanation and is fundamentally good; the disappearance of those in the movie is never explained and is represented as fearful, threatening and evil.When the movie stops the story is continuing but the movie isn't; that's sort of a relief really, one has the feeling whew, it's finally over. This is definitely one I suggest watching before you buy; I'm quite sure I'll never watch it again."
"I tried to like this movie but I just could not totally get into it. It had a nice premise for a story but 99.99% of all of the people vanish at the start of the movie. You are left with 4 or 5 characters that typically do stupid things to protect themselves and the one who is the most on the ball is a little girl who appears in the movie for 5 minutes.This post-apocalyptic movie could be more scary but is totally filmed in the dark they saved a lot on special effects and actors. No electricity worked, batteries failed, no cars worked, and the remaining characters do the typical dumb stuff like not seeking out a more viable light source to protect them.The plot is weak and doesn't develop as the characters have no idea what has caused this mass ending of the human race. There is no sense of possible rescue and the movie just ends strangely. It could have been scarier with a better sound track and some more shocking flashes that make people jump, but they were not there.I almost gave this movie a 3 until the ending and then my opinion faded like the lights in the movie."
"VANISHING ON 7TH STREET is a dark, dreary look at what transpires after an enigmatic catastophic event that has unexplicably resulted in the vanishing of all forms of life--and not just on 7th street.As expected, there are five survivors:  a young TV anchorman, a distraught mother, a teenage boy whose vanished mom runs the cafe where most of the action occurs, a lonely movie projectionist and a mysterious little girl.  And lots of menacing shadows and whispering voices.  Early on, we're given hints of the lost colony of Roanoke; ""dark matter"" and the approach of a strange storm.  Are any of these responsible for the vanishing?  We don't really find out--that lack of resolution annoys me--I'd like SOME kind of resolution.Director Brad Anderson (THE MACHINIST, SESSION 9) evinces some minor atmospheric chills but not much true terror.  The cast is adequate:  Hayden Christensen is a stalwart hero; Thandie Newton is strong as the mother; Jacob Latimore is a fresh change from the usual badass streetwise teen, but John Leguizamo's surprisingly good in his low-level performance.  Similar territory is covered in the lamentable THE HAPPENING, but at least they offered ""SOMETHING"" as a reason for the occurrences, albeit pretty lame.Ultimately, the movie never catches fire and seems longer than it is."
"This movie is take of the Roanoke Colony disappearance from American colonial history.  Meant to be a horror movie, I did not find this movie scary in the least bit.  In fact, the essence of the story; i.e. shadows stealing people away, is quite ridiculous.  Add to that is a lot of bad acting from all the adult actors and actresses and we have a movie that flopped at both the theaters and on DVD.  Stay away viewers."
This movie could have been great if they had more production money. The actors probably took 80 % of the budget. They kind of set the movie up in the first few minutes with a book title about Dark Matter and the disappearance of the Lost Colony then it was like the Energizer Bunny it just kept going and going with no real plot development after that. Was it extraterrestrials controlling dark matter? Was it a supernatural force like vampires or aliens that are sensitive to all forms of light and discovered how to make it dark so they could swoop down and take their prey? Was the dark sentient and literally consumed people to survive? Was this the end or the beginning of the end? Was this just a way for the producer to make a quick buck(it bombed worldwide) without much substance? Was this a waste of 92 minutes? Tune in for the sequel. OK folks you can breathe now there is no sequel planned..at least not yet!!!
"Vanishing On 7th Street had a lot of possibilities, but it was done so narrow-mindedly, that the film just becomes a complete waste of time. First, we are rushed into the heart of the story, without any background or character development. Then, within twenty minutes, we're thrown ahead three days, leaving us with many questions that are never answered. Finally, after an hour of typical frantic people stuck in an impossible situation, we get an ending that just doesn't fit. I was attracted to this film by its clever title and by Hayden Christensen, who I believe to be a very underrated actor, but I was highly disappointed. Vanishing On 7th Street is rushed, sloppy, predictable, and full of plot holes. To me this seemed more like a rough draft than a full length feature film, it really just wasn't very good."
"How can you run from the dark?  After waking up to an empty city Luke (Christensen) and a small group of survivors try to find a way to escape.  When they realize the darkness is what is causing the vanishings can they find enough light to survive?  Based on the previews I had pretty high expectations for this movie, it was very slow moving.  The idea was pretty creepy, and it is tons better then ""The Happening"", although the story line was pretty similar.  This movie seems like a really good ""Twilight Zone"" episode, but it doesn't really work as a full length movie.  It gets repeatitive pretty quick.  It begins as a pretty scary movie, but runs out of steam quick and begins to drag.  This is not a bad movie at all, but after the ""last man on earth"" type movies like ""I Am Legend"" this one doesn't really compare.  Much, much better then ""The Happening"", but not one to rush out and see.  I give it a C.Would I watch again? - Probebly not.*Also try - Skyline & The Happening"
"This is a review for Video on Demand. This, in no way, is meant to say that the service is lacking. It is a great one. this is reviewing the movie.In the city, strange things are taking place. At first it seems like nothing more than some shadow play and a bit of urban migration, but that turns to panick as the numbers go up. Overnight, people literally leave their homes and vanish, taking nothing. As the mystery here deepens, so too do the reasons to why this is taking place.When I first saw this advertised in the pages fof Fangoria, I was immediately shopping for a venue to watch it. That was a couple of weeks ago and I should have written a review then, perhaps saving some people money. I apologize for that but I normally do not do the negative route. Still, this is a terrible way to fleece peolple with a good idea and terrible execution.What you have here is a tale of two proverbial cities, with one going off greatly in the storyline department and then taking a sudden turn and going down boring Street. I know - I have been there before and recognized the signs. I watched it with two other people as well, and they concurred. A lot of things went wrong and made this awful.You start with people going away in a weird way and people asking why. The main actors hang in there through this, and it all seems good. Then you have some of the scenes that try to keep people out of the shadows, some that made it seem as though the world is really hard to understand, and even when the vanishings start to make sense it hurts to watch it progress. The writers are at fault in a lot of this, and the direction hurts as well. What you have is an "" o no, avoid that shadow"" story mingling with a really boring output from the actors. Overacting is a theme as well as trying to make you scared of the nothing that is really not menacing, and it gets old fast. Really fast.I wish I could say something better but, in the end, I don't know how. What I do know is that you should not et this and, for 10 bucks, you should heed all the warnings out there. This is about a 1.5, with the .5 coming from the beginning. Hopefully that says something aobut it, and hopefully you feel safe and avoid it.It isn't the dark you should be afraid of, after all. It is a movie about it."
"[The review contains minor spoilers.]""Vanishing on 7th Street"" starts with a bang and slowly descends into something dull and formulaic. The thriller drama (directed by Brad Anderson, much better ""The Machinist"") begins with a great premise, building up the tension in the first fifteen minutes until it suddenly loses steam, having nothing new or interesting to add to the thin story that goes nowhere.The opening sequence is just brilliant. Paul (understated and effective John Leguizamo) is a projectionist working at a packed Detroit theater. Then, suddenly the light fails. The next moment Paul finds himself alone (well, almost) in the silent theater - everyone is gone, perhaps everyone in the entire city. The fact is, Paul - and a news reporter Luke (Hayden Christensen), a therapist Rosemary (Thandie Newton) and a young boy named James (Jacob Latimore) - are among the ""survivors"" of the mysterious blackout.In this kind of suspense (like ""The Birds"") you don't have to explain everything, as long as you can keep the viewers interested in what is going on. Unfortunately this does not happen in ""Vanishing on 7th Street."" Information is given bit by bit - long nights, a man in Chicago, the Roanoke Colony, and most importantly, rules for survival - but they add up to nothing. Characters attempt to theorize about the meaning of total ""wipeout,"" but what they talk about is just dull. Some ideas are directly borrowed from other apocalyptic horror movies. An airplane scene from Kiyoshi Kurosawa's ""Pulse,"" one of possible inspiration, is just one of them.""Vanishing on 7th Street"" starts well, but fails to live up to its initial promise."
"The other reviewer of this show said it perfect; Sarah Shahi gets to 'shine' in this show as opposed to her rather 'dour' character presentation in her cop show ""Life"". And her 'shine' is awesome--she is gorgeous, sexy and has a spunky character to work with, but...the show seems to say ""Mediation"" is the second coming and that just didn't 'win' me over. Sarah's relationship with her ex-husband the DA is ok and I like how she interacts with the other characters in her short skirts but the 'meat' of the program that Mediation results in a 'win,win' situation for folks headed to Court with lawyers is just not that interesting or believeable. So I found Sarah a '10' and hope she finds another series that matches her dazzling beauty and personality, but I found this show just too 'dumb' and 'light' to continue watching after about 6 episodes. And for some reason, I got this show at Target a month ago 6 weeks before you could buy it on Amazon."
"The premis sounded great but after a couple of episodes, I found that I did not care for the main character.  She was too pushy and manipulative. I found all of the family drama a bit overboard."
"I am a Drop Dead Diva fan.  I also enjoyed Legally Blonde.  This however, I could have slept through.  Even at free, it wasn't really worth the time."
"The American Being Human isn't nearly as good as the British version. The writing is similar, but ""cheesier"". The acting is not as good. The British actors were more authentic and fit their parts better.This is not just because I saw the British version first--the American version is lame."
"we laughed, a little, at first, but it just isnt Danny DeVito, rolling in your seat funny. it is a little funny and thats it."
The egg and I would have done better. here is a nerd who obviously wants to be a murder dog. ( give me a break) With his ingrating voice and his nerdy ways giving us a blow by blow of his own mother? How sick can you get??? A voice man might have made this fly. Did this man view this before putting it out? Did anyone advice him to hire an actor with a good voice to do the narration? Guess not or he thought he was this sexy detective type . Grand elushions an't the word.
"My two year old daughter really likes this show, but I find it hard to watch with her. There are plenty of better options out there that are both entertaining and educational. (Sesame Street, Curious George, Caillou, the Leapfrog series)"
I think there may be some value here.  I didn't watch it to the end because of the strength of the tension in the show.... not for me.
"I really tried to get into this one but it just wasn't for me.  I didn't think the writing or acting was bad or anything like that, but it just wasn't for me."
"While I liked the show, I didn't like the people in it and that made it uncomfortable to watch it."
"Its like in the 70's when short movies by unknown homedirectors started to come out... all associated with the films think their movieis great caused its so different but i always saw them as wanna be home movies.this is a quality wanna be ....some will love it cause its different and more willlike it cause it does'nt follow the same protocol as most movies today.The only good thing about the version i bought is the 3d cover on the dvd.Instead of CGI to give the Tire better life, all we get is good angles at rollingaround and the tire shakes when it gets mad...and...Bottom Line...Boring. Eventhe exploding heads cant save this DVD.Use as coaster after view."
"this was an odd movie, it was okay not one of the best films i've seen magnet did better with Black Death. when i saw the trailer to this i thought what the hell i'll try it. and it was horrible. i did not understand the motive to this film at all. except that there is a killer tire. it was weird i'll give you that if the director was aiming for that he did a good job. but all in all i won't see it again. if you have not seen this movie i recommend that you don't"
"On one hand, the editing and the cinematography (by Quentin Dupieux) are fabulous.  On the other hand, the screenplay and the direction (by Quentin Dupieux) are dreadful.  Someone should have been fired.This is a movie about a gimmick, played as a gimmick, that doesn't succeed because it is a gimmick that's stretched to its limits and beyond.  Once the premise is set down there's nowhere for this movie to go.  It's a joke that tells you it's a joke.  In fact, it informs you of this straight off and just in case you ""didn't get it,"" they repeat the explanation during the closing credits.  It's been my experience that if something has to be identified as a joke and you don't laugh, repeating it as such isn't going to help.The best parts of this movie involve the tire (Robert) on its own.  The worst parts are when they involve people through a faux audience watching the proceedings and commenting on what they're watching, and a squad of police trying to stop the tire from its reign of terror.  It's sad to say, but the tire gives the best and most realistic performance."
"If you're going to parody American horror films there are only three requirements: be funny, cover a variety of situations, and keep the pace up.  This mostly fails on every count.  The ""audience"" gorging themselves on poison is too literal.  The main characters are far too bland.  Insomniacs should buy it: watching this tire roll is very sleep-inducing."
"RUBBER tells the story of an abandoned tire that abruptly comes to life.  Not only that, but this tire has the ability to kill with the power of its ""mind.""  There is NO reason that this tire comes to life, nor is there a reason it has homicidal tendencies.  It just does.  In fact, the conceit of this movie is so random that we are told (literally told) that the movie is an ""homage to no reason.""  And it certainly is.The idea of the film is undeniably amusing.  That someone even came up with the idea is worth applauding.  And the method in which the story is told and the film is crafted is undeniably amusing.  Writer/director Quentin Dupieux has made a film that is bit more theatre-of-the-absurd than it is a horror movie.  The main character (a sheriff played by Stephen Spinella, a great stage actor who looks just a little surprised to be in this film) frequently talks to the audience, and the ""audience"" is a character too.  Randomness is the order of the day, thus virtually no character behaves in predictable ways.RUBBER is a terrific 40 minute movie.  Sadly, the movie is actually 80+ minutes, so it is a shaggy dog joke that quickly wears out its welcome.  The natural lengthy of this amusing but slight concept is stretched past the breaking point by either a) too much effort to be clever, which finally comes off as just TOO random or b) endless shots of the tire rolling across the desert.  Not surprisingly, the tire has little personality and little it can do beyond roll or stand still...and watching it do these 2 things is not terribly exciting (I was amused when the tire took a deliberate dip in a swimming pool).The film, which I watched on blu-ray, has some lovely desert scenery.  But other than Spinella, it has a Grade-Z cast, which might be okay in a straight horror movie, but here it just adds to the level of oddness.  The film is a joke on the audience, but with this cast, it also appears to be a joke on the performers, who have no sense of motivation or purpose.  ""Just say the oh-so-clever lines...don't worry about why.""If you're in the mood for a strange but exciting, bloody, gory or scary movie...RUBBER is NOT it.  If you are in the mood for one of the flat-out oddest films around, you might want to check it out.  But I warned you...it's a fun idea in search of far better pace and execution and just a bit more logic."
I usual enjoy movies with Uma Thurman but Ceremony tried to be  a romantic comedy yet failed. The tempo was slow and the actors mediocre. Ceremony is simply a movie not worth watching. I'm glad I didn't spend the extra money to purchase this movie. I wouldn't watch it again and wouldn't recommend to anyone.
"This indi-film opened recently with a thud, and is now available on disc.  I'm not sure what has happened to Uma Thurman's career but this adds to a list of her clunkers.  The set up isn't a creative one.  Twenty three year old geeky children's book author Sam Davis (Michael Angarano) isn't having much success and he's recently dumped by the statuesque Zoe (Thurman).  Now right there we have a problem.  Sam is about 5 foot nothing and Zoe is about a foot taller, not to mention well on her way to 40.  Don't get me wrong, the problem isn't there physical differences, it's that there is no chemistry or attraction for the audience.  Sam and his best friend Marshall (Reece Daniel Thompson) decide to get away to rekindle their bromance (strictly hetero).  They run into Zoe who is about to get married on the beach.  Foolishness ensues. The film's not sexy or funny so what's the point?"
This program is ridiculous! Are employees and CEOs really that stupid? I am sure the employees are hand picked to insure they tow the company line. How can that many employees have such sad sob story lives? This program is just an infomercial for businesses that treat their employees poorly.
I didn't watch very much as the subject of someone drowning in a trunk of a car made my claustrophobia scream. If that does not bother you it would be a good show...
"I won't ""spoil"" the series for anyone who hasn't watched, but it promised a lot, and delivered only a little. Very disappointed. It's going to take a lot for me to watch next season, especially if I have to pay for some of the episodes."
"Be aware, when you start watching the first season, you will not find out who did it. There is an episode of padding thrown in, instead of a resolution. I understand that season 2 will not show a resolution until the end of the season. I resent this type of manipulation of the audience. Starting a new mystery, before the end of the first one, would have been acceptable to me, but not drawing out the ending for so long. I will not be watching season 2."
"2012: Apocalypse of the Dead (a.k.a. Zone of the Dead) is one of those flicks that is so horribly bad, it's good. In a way, you almost have to laud the commitment and conviction presented by the filmmakers because it takes those traits to follow thru with (let's just call it) their ""vision."" Anyway, a good time was had at the movies by me and my snarky homies.But it's not a good time to be in Pancevo, Serbia, not tonight. Pancevo is reputed to be the most toxic city in all of Europe. Legendary Interpol Agent Mortimer Reyes (Ken Foree) and rookie agent Mina Milius (Kristina Klebe) are the principals in overseeing a prisoner transfer of which route will take them to Belgrave and then London. Did your eyes roll, like mine did, when Reyes reassured a nervous Mina: ""If ever there was an easy assignment, this is it."" Oboy.But before they get to easy street, they have to pass thru Pancevo, just in time for that unnatural chemical leak  at the railroad track and the resulting zombie outbreak. Cornered by zombie hordes, desperate to survive, the agents join forces with their enigmatic prisoner (Emilio Roso) who seems to be more in the loop about what the ef is going on with the walking dead.Later, the group crosses paths with a sniveling reporter and a berserker soldier (fresh out the nunnery) who spouts doomsday propaganda. Weird? Surreal? Creepy? Offputting? Yes. This crazed warrior would go on to say (with gusto) things like: ""Smells like the end of days.""Oh, where to start, where to start? I'm tempted to give this a higher rating, only because I had ba11s of fun. But I won't. This is the first ever Serbian zombie movie, so congratulations, but it's crap. The production is so low budget I suspect my 6-year-old niece was the money behind it. The acting - I'm not sure if the English was dubbed for the Serbs or if the Serbian actors spoke their lines phonetically. Theirs is some of the worst delivery of dialogue I'd ever heard. The intonations, the inflections, are weird. The body language is off. But I don't want to cut slack on the other cast members who flaunts English as their native tongue. They're also ridiculous. The entire cast is so wooden no one had better light a match. My main reason for tuning in was to watch Ken Foree, who was so badass in Romero's seminal Dawn of the Dead (and maybe the best zombie film of all time). Here - and, given, it's some thirty years later - Foree seems comparatively subdued and worn down.The gorehound elements? Are weak. The zombie make-up is passable. But there's not much in the way of authentic scares. The zombie feastings are executed so cheesily. Neither are there memorable zombie kills. What's more, the zeds can't make up their minds whether they're slow shufflers or fast, hyperactive runners.The film isn't well served by its characters making moronic decisions (given, most are there to engorge the body count). Or by that horrid shaky cam.The positives? Yes, there are some, other than the happy accident of the film's sucking so hard, it gets good. Three good things. The Serbian setting is appropriately moody. I liked the nod to Assault on Precinct 13. The prisoner here is no Napoleon Wilson but he affects some of Napoleon's cool under pressure and shaky allegiance. The other neat thing is the meta-reference to Dawn of the Dead:- Jan the d0uche reporter: ""Wait, maybe we should find some shopping mall or something.""- Agent Reyes: ""It'd be too hard to secure. And believe me, they would get in anyway.""Best moment in the movie.Parting observations off the top of my head (and, I guess, a SPOILERS alert):- In the midst of fleeing the zeds, folks will insist on having meaningful discussions- snapping necks shouldn't kill zombies because the brain isn't affected (but it works in this movie)- Yes, absolutely, a desk with some chairs on it shoved against the door will keep out the zeds- Until a girl has a panic attack and starts dismantling that desk and chairs because, quote, ""I need to get out!""- Lovin' the prisoner's dramatic but absolutely unnecessary midair leap while gunning down zeds (who are still blocked by that desk)- Living legend, ex-CIA, 20-years-in-the-field, Interpol Agent Mortimer Reyes needs to work on his stance when holding a firearm. Also someone needs to teach him the proper technique for holding a gun and flashlight together.- When the group encounters a bunch of zombies lying prone on the ground (sunbathing?) in almost perfectly spaced order, Agent Reyes opts to walk thru them instead of, say, around them.- A professor decides to check if the area is finally clear of poison gas. How? By removing his gas mask.- So what happened to that girl who was abandoned at the dock by the creepy reporter? She gets saved by the prophecy warrior but then we don't see her anymore.- Stick around for a mid-credits scene to see what happens to the reporter. It's a lazy nod to the opening sequence of Lucio Fulci's classic Zombi 2 (1979)."
"Poor original Dawn of the Dead alumni Ken Foree, he deserves so much better than this Z grade zombie flick..complete with old slow style and new fast running style zombies.. I like the genre, but it's flims like this one that make me never want to watch another. It's as good as the eastern Europeans trying to fake American English accents.. I would recommend it for a good laugh, but there's other things to laugh at out there, this was just boring. Here's just a sample of the type of dialogue that you will get:&#34;This is probably the worst thing that has happened since.. the beginning of civilized world.. and I'm a part of it, and I don't have a care..Isn't that sh!+ just great?.. What is it now, are you angry??&#34;As for the special effects, eh... ((((YAWN))))"
I didn't like the movie.  The acting was lame as was the script.  It felt like a wannabe grindhouse gone wrong.  There are some one liners said in the movie that were suppose to be funny but fell flat.  The plot is that of a simple revenge movie with no surprises....spoiler alert........if you haven't watched it and want to you may not want to read further...hobo dies taking out final bad guy.  I gave it two stars just for the amount of gore although most is blood splatters but not all.
"Another nod to the grindhouse movies and based on a trailer in one of Robert Rodriguez's grindhouse films.  This action exploitation film has over the top horrible people doing above and beyond what you would normally expect.  There's a pedophiliac Santa Claus taking screaming children away in his car while nobody does anything, a corrupt police force that is in on the evil, an evil overlord with two violent sons who murder people wherever they go (including using a flamethrower on children on a school bus).  If you can handle the extreme violence there's a lot of tongue and cheek references and moments that take some of the edge off.  Naturally these evil people have it coming when the hobo pulls out his shotgun and goes to town on them all and we're glad to see it.  At times it feels like the scenes are more about the violence and very little about the story.  I like to think you can blend both but this doesn't always do it.  Dialogue is bad in certain place and I am not certain if that was done on purpose as a homage to the old films of the past.  Regardless I've seen better films of said genre and this was way over the top for my tastes. STORY/PLOTTING: C; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C minus to C; VIOLENCE/EXPLOITATION: B; WHEN WATCHED: end of of July 2011; OVERALL GRADE: C plus."
"I was pretty disappointed with what I thought was going to be a fun episode of Robert Rodriguez or Quinton Tarantino style retro-flick.  I think that was the idea as this movie was hinted at in one of the ""Grindhouse"" trailers.  While it's nice to see Rutger Hauer again especially with the in-your-face title in hand, the film never gets past the raw carnage and bloody gore of the premise.  Hauer is a railcar hopping hobo who stumbles upon a nasty town that for some reason nobody leaves.  The population stays in spite of the fact that the police and politicians are controlled by the evil Drake and his 2 equally evil sons. They stay in spite of the fact that it's acceptable to board a school bus and kill all the kiddies with a flame thrower...and of course, for no reason.  I found the movie pretty stupid without much to recommend."
"I have read extensively about the Kennedys and there was no new information in this series. It only consisted of the general info that is available anywhere. The acting was a bit stale. I am a big Greg Kinear fan, but he wasn't impressive either, so all in all, I couldn't recommend this series to anyone. And, Katie Holmes was very forgettable as Jackie Kennedy. So, disappointing all the way around. Don't waste your time."
Kids like it. From a parents perspective I don't think it teaches anything positive  and is very crude. I actually wish there was a way to block certain shows from the Amazon app is not certain devices. If there were I'd block this one.
"I may have chuckled once during this episode (Amazon Prime only includes the first episode).Basically, the episode relies on juvenile bathroom humor.  Character development is poor and unless you're a stoner I doubt you'll find much redeeming social value in the situation or the characters' approach to it."
"I thought this would be so funny, but I'd just fall asleep and let my boyfriend watch it.  He didn't think it was funny, either.  The timing just wasn't right, but the premises seemed like they SHOULD have been hilarious."
Don't care for it but see how many people could like it.  Just not into this type of show.they just don't do anything and keep the stereotype going of the people not striving for anything.
"The show had a good premise, but it was unnecessarily vulgar. I thought it might be a good substitute for the IT Crowd, but I was wrong."
"This show should have been ONE Season only. The writing has become stupid whereas the producers think the public is gulable. For instance, they try to add drama to the scene when they have caught a gator and the hunter puts his hand into the water to pull up the rope. It is supposed to make you uneasy since a gator could bite him. Yet the camera is below his hand (in the water) shooting up.When they are wrestling with the caught gator, the people on the boat are yelling out different things to each other, such as:&#34;Watch him!&#34; OR &#34;Shoot him!&#34; OR &#34;Oh...he's a big one!&#34;. But when you watch these people, their mouths are NEVER moving. It's as if these comments are added in later for effect.Personally, I root for the gator."
"My Ghost Story is supposed to be a collection of true stories told by the people they happened to. There is nothing very exciting about the filming, special effects, atmosphere. Nothing impressive about the series in my opinion."
I don't want to say that this movie is snobbish but I'm having a difficult time trying to see it any other way.Here's the scoop. It's set in Manhattan and all involved are upper crust professionals. Knightley is married to Worthington. She's a freelance writer for magazines and  he's in commercial real estate development. She finds out he has a real hot co-worker (Eva Mendez) and is upset because he's never mentioned her. Sam heads off on a business trip with Eva and another co-worker and while he's gone Kiera runs into an old flame. Both are tempted and this deals with how they deal with the temptation.I couldn't muster any real sympathy for these people. It's not that I didn't like them but it seemed that there was too little at stake for any of them. All could make a living in their own right. There are no kids involved. None of the relationships have a lot of years attached and none of the relationships are without their blemishes. What if this were set in some blue collar town and the husband and wife were just scraping by and had a lot of concerns in their day to day and some number of young kids in tow? This I think who mean more to the average viewer. And what is the writer/director saying here in that Worthington crosses the line in a big way where Knightley just tip-toes over the line. She was the one with unfounded fears and jealousies where he never doubted her for a moment? Is she less guilty than he?!This is all very professional. All the acting and production values are top shelf. It's just that there seemed to be too little gravity to it. Even when Mendez spills her guts it didn't want to hit home. Sorry. I can't recommend this.
"""Last Night"" stars four gifted players Guillaume Canet, Keira Knightley, Eva Mendes and Sam Worthington. It also has Peter Deming's nice, atmospheric photography and Clint Mansell's mesmerizing score. Largely set in New York, the film has everything that would make a witty and insightful drama about loyalty in marriage, with a realistic look on married life, told in a romantic but not sentimental fashion. Sadly, well-acted as it is, the film lacks something emotional that would draw the viewers into the characters' world.""Last Night"" follows the story of married couple Joanna (Keira Knightley) and Michael (Sam Worthington) living in New York. While Michael is in Philadelphia for a business trip, Alex (Guillaume Canet) Joanna's ex-boyfriend arrives from Paris to meet her. In the meanwhile, Michael in Philadelphia is alone with his co-worker Laura (Eva Mendes), and he is clearly attracted to her.What will they do? The unpredictable story has some touching moments, but after all, it is very hard for us to care about these characters, especially Sam Worthington's Michael. His uninteresting character works against the film's attempt at creating suspenseful romance. Knightley and Canet fare much better, but with barely enough chemistry to make us believe the flimsy back story of the characters they play, their romantic relationship is not very involving.""Last Night"" is a drama that is sometimes pretentious (see the ending) but overall watchable, thanks to the compelling performance from Keira Knightley."
"I enjoyed The Sopranos so decided to give this a whirl in order to see if fiction and ""reality"" overlap much. It turns out that this is not only comparing apples to oranges; it is also like comparing the Mona Lisa (The Sopranos) to an avant-garde exhibit that consists of a pile of poop (Mob Wives). I am loathe to review an available season without having watched it in its entirety, but I just couldn't get thru many eps of this... there is only so much dim-witted posturing, backstabbing, lying, and general ugliness that I can handle in any given month (when not balanced out by creativity and other redeeming qualities, as in a work of fiction).From a purely anthropological viewpoint, however, this show has some worth. It provides a small bit of insight into what a blue collar criminal lifestyle can lead to: material wealth, broken families, and a mindset of coming at problems shouting and predisposed to violence. Since Mob Wives is not without context, it also offers perspective on a broader (societal) scale. It is, more often than not, a sickening serial to watch, even if you are prone to being entertained by low culture. I estimate that two of the women are of very low intelligence, one is of low intelligence, and one is of low to moderate intelligence. Aside from needing the money, I can't imagine why these 4 would have agreed to do this show (although if I remember correctly, one of them wanted to write a book, so this is obviously good publicity). They either are clueless about how pathetic they appear to the rest of us, or they don't care (laughing all the way to the bank).I skipped ahead to an episode titled ""Dumb or Stupid?"" (the producers probably would have liked this to be the name of the show, rather than just one episode) because I wanted to see how far these women would go against their ""friends"" at a dinner gathering. Unfortunately, a guy on the set intervened before any blood was spilled. Mobsters just aren't what they used to be."
no story line.  not enlightening about life within the &#34;family.&#34;  presenttion of women who probably as street as their husbands.
"It is okay.  Same thing over and over.  When you have seen one wives reality show, you've seen them all."
"I watched ""Burn Notice: The Fall of Sam Axe"" with a fair amount of expectation and anticipation. I have watched the ""Burn Notice"" series from its inception with my spouse and I think that it's fair to say that it is one of our favorite weekly programs. Add to that, I have been a tireless devotee to the brilliant Bruce Campbell for more years than I care to recognize in print (decades!). So, this made-for TV movie seemed like a can't miss proposition. And, indeed, it begins on a decidedly whimsical note as Campbell faces a military tribunal for an escapade gone wrong. With his trademark bluster, Campbell challenges authority like no one else! His character has become a fan favorite over the years due to his verbal interplay with his series's co-stars Gabrielle Anwar and, most notably, Jeffrey Donovan. Donovan directs this tepid prequel and puts in a cameo, but its just long enough to highlight what's missing from this incarnation of the Burn Notice saga.As much as I liked the comedic stylings of the present day military sequences, one would expect a terrific, funny and larger than life episode to showcase Sam's outrageousness. In fact, the jungle exploits between a corrupt military junta and a ragtag band of rebel fighters just seems far too easy and conventional. In a set-up used in countless other films, Sam is sent as an observer to a third world nationality and discovers that all is not as it seems in their plight with rebel forces. Soon Sam is in the thick of things protecting an altruistic hospital (sweet) and its strong and dedicated American/Canadian doctors (no language barriers here!). But it is a sassy rebel orphan who really seals the deal in this film. Painfully unreal and contrived, the girl exists to personalize the story--but is just one more example of a character construct as opposed to a real person. That's right, the great Campbell's principle foil is a precocious teen--uggh!The strength of Burn Notice, as I mentioned above, is in its verbal pyrotechnics. The characters play off one another with rapid fire dexterity, and Campbell is an integral part of that success. Here, the script lacks the savvy and the smarts necessary to make this must-see entertainment and Campbell's big persona fails to have a match in the likable, if forgettable, ensemble of the film. Another part of the series' charm comes from stylish adventure and a palpable sense of danger. Here, the action is straightforward and lacking the visual flair we'd expect from the show. And as for danger, there's never a doubt as to the outcome of this fairly generic tale. As a Campbell enthusiast, I prefer his campier film forays and as a Burn Notice fan--this only hinted at the elements which distinguish the show. I watched it, it was pleasnat enough, but I can't imagine a second viewing. If you don't watch Burn Notice, though--you're missing out. I suggest you start there! KGHarris, 4/11."
"Meh.A made-for-tv story with low(ish) budget values... attempts were made to make Sam Axe appear younger but all this aside, the story was very weak and added zero IMHO to the overall series.If you enjoy the show then you *might* like this episode... but Michael Westen barely appears and to me there's little to elaborate on the Sam persona that might add value to the tv show itself.It all feels a little pandering and derivative. If you're hungry for a meal, just take note that this is a light snack. And not tasty-popcorn-indulgence type snack either... more like chip shards and leftover guacamole dip from last night."
I think Matt Smith will successfully kill this franchise after 50 years. Too bad old chap! You just don't emote the complexities of the Doctor.
"Explanation For Lower Rating:I'm not sure what the History Channel is doing with their DVD releases this year, but it is certainly a step in the wrong direction.  When they released ""Pawn Stars: Volume Three,"" many people assumed that the show would be Season Three as the other two seasons of the program had been released in their entirety.  It was, in fact, only sixteen episodes.  When they released ""American Pickers: Volume Two,"" it was the same thing.  Season One had been released with all episodes, but this Volume Two was only eight episodes of Season Two.  I know some people that preordered sight unseen, or just weren't paying attention, felt a little shortchanged by these smaller portions as opposed to what they had assumed were full season DVD releases.  Personally, I didn't agree with the decision--but, at least, the DVD packaging was very clear about what was included.  Anyone who read the box knew what to expect--how many episodes and which ones, so it wasn't a blind investment!Not so for ""American Restoration, Volume One!""  I am sitting here with the DVD in hand and nowhere does it say how many episodes are inside.  Never mind that it doesn't list them (which in my opinion it should if it is not a Complete Season package)--it doesn't even tell you how many episodes you are getting.  I suppose I'm supposed to look at the running time and do some estimated mathematics?  I know this may seem trivial to some or that I'm overreacting, but I think the company owes potential buyers this information.  My lower rating, therefore, reflects the History Channel's (or A&E; Networks distributing) apparent disregard for its own fan base.  I don't like to make purchases without knowing exactly what I'm paying for!I, however, will tell you what is inside.  The 2 DVD set has sixteen episodes:  all four from the abbreviated Season One and the first twelve from Season Two.  Really, how hard would it have been to include the fact that there were sixteen episodes on the DVD box?Season One: (1) Hopalong Rock, (2) Ice Cold, (3) Lights Out, and (4) Buttered Up.Season Two: (1) Cooler Kings, (2) Knockout, (3) Duck and Cover, (4)Pumped Up, (5) Space Kowboy, (6) Jackpot, (7) Safe Keeping, (8) Suck Up, (9) Rev'd Up, (10) Apples and X-Rays, (11) Hot & Cold, and (12) Secret Fan.Actual Review:I will be brief in my actual review since I already went on a tirade.  ""American Restoration"" is an offshoot of the popular ""Pawn Stars,"" and fits comfortably into the History Channel's stable of reality based programming.  Its star (Rick Dale) made semi-regular appearances on that program, but now we get a closer look at what he does.  Based in Las Vegas, Dale and team locate objects that might be of value (or represent lost bits of Americana) and figure out ways to restore the item to its former glory.  It's an easy show to like and fascinating especially if you enjoy antiquing or modern day treasure hunting shows (Pawn Stars, Storage Wars and others).  I found it very interesting to see the different techniques of this unusual art form--and I do think Dale is an artist!  The program itself merits four stars.  KGHarris, 11/11."
"It seems since season 10 or 11, each season has had really mediocre/bad episodes and one or two exceptional ones, rinse and repeat. I love all of Trey Parker's works, ranging from Cannibal the Musical to the Book of Mormon, but south park is frankly getting lazy. Stop me if you've seen this before: Cartman takes something to a whacky extreme, and when people see how depraved/whacky he is, they just stare at him with their mouths agape while he keeps doing his song and dance. Rinse, REPEAT. It seems like in each episode all of the characters serve as nothing more than the backdrop to the whacky shenanigans of Eric Cartman. Same applies to whichever other character decides to go apesh** in each South Park episode, everyone just mutely stares at whatever's going on.It's this predictability that's made South Park stale and boring. In the first couple seasons it was less slanted at being a parody of the world now and more focused on the boys being boys, as well as having a sly commentary on the side, now it's just all political commentary. After seeing Team America and hell even Your Studio & You south park just seems like a lazy crutch, where's their punk rock attitude from the 90's?"
"It's amazing to see how many people recommended this movie and give it a five star vote. Maybe it's because I went into it after reading reviewers comments and they hyped the movie up more then it was, but I went in expecting something mind blowing, and all I found was disappointment in what I would hardly call anything more then a science fiction movie re-inventing what you think about Trolls. It's definitely not a horror movie, nor a thriller.. it's not scary, unless you are a complete wuss that is afraid of your own shadow, and the re-invention of Trolls as large monsters that the Norwegian Government don't want people to know about is just plain silly.::Plot::3 College kids are out and about looking for something to film, as they haven't got much else better to do. They find a town where there is a dead bear that has supposedly been shot, but some of the people they interview beleive it was not shot, as no one has laid claim to the kill, and tracks around the bear look suspicious. The trio end up following a man who they think may be a suspect to the bear shooting. They follow him into the woods and end up running away from a strange sound caused by something big that is chasing them. They team up with the man who they where following, who just happens to be the #1 and only Troll hunter in Norway who explains to them that he doesn't mind them filming what he does, as long as they do exactly what he says. He also explains that the government know about the trolls and that he is paid to hunt them down if they go outside their territories nearer to human populated areas. He also explains that he doesn't care if they film this secret, because the government pays him very little, which I found hard to swallow, but OK. The Norway leaders only need one guy to hunt these things... sure. Okie Dokey then. Anyway...The 4 of them go on a hunt of trolls, learn how trolls are tracked, their species, and how to get a blood sample of one for a veterinarian.::End Plot::With everyone saying this is a must see movie, and how scary it is, It makes me wonder what other movies those people have been exposed to so far? Because this movie, it's not all as great as it's being hyped up to be. It's kind of like Blair Witch style but they are on the hunt of large mammals that either explode or turn to stone when they are exposed to ultraviolet UV rays.Sure they CGI is not bad, but that does not make a movie brilliant. I was drifting in and out of consciousness by the end of the movie. I dunno, maybe I prefer my scary movies to make sense or have a more interesting plot going on, but I didn't find this movie as gripping or compelling as some others have been saying it is. I'm not saying don't see it, I know people have different tastes, and although this didn't appeal to me, I'm sure other will. Like many of my reviews, it's more here as a reminder to myself why I didn't enjoy it all that much."
The concept of this show is good. The people in this show are not. It seems to me like they blame all of these &#34;hauntings&#34; on objects that would look cool in their museum.'I believe this object is the reason why your home is haunted. What would you like to do? I can take it to my museum for you and rid you of the haunting.'Tools.
"I like paranormal shows, but this one seems a little more hard to swallow than some of the rest of them."
I'm only watching this series because I've run out of other things to watch. I'm so tired of seeing women who chase bad guys in 3&#34; heels! The intro to the show with the motorcycle is just silly. It's ok but not great.
I watched about 30  minutes and realized it's not for me.  It is a good show but it's on the line of White Collar.  Their good but the acting is fair and the writing is C+.
This was not my favorite.  Too much fowl language and degrading others.
"I really don't understand why this show was brought back. There are too many characters every one of them irritating, and none of them are sympathetic. There's constantly too much uproar and turmoil among them and around them as the plots are confusing and uninspiring. The leader, a doctor, is a pompous and inept person with an agenda to promote specially gifted people he calls ""alphas"" but who are generally antisocial and even dangerous unless he alone can get them to behave civily for a few moments per episode.  The special gifts are already boring--example: the close up of the ""strong man's"" arteries as he pumps up. I can't stand ""Gary"" the human fiber optic reader. He's neither engaging nor cute, never funny, just a thorn in the side of all because he's special but wait, they are all special! He don't care. He's more specialer.  Just that character alone is so annoying I don't plan to spend any more time ""with him"" watching this. This show should have vanished along with ""3 inches"", a show about a guy with telekinetic powers but could only do it as far as 3 inches. At least that had some humorous potential. This show is as interesting as some car ads. By the time it's over you've forgotten what was being advertised. I don't own this but I was requested to review the show."
"Great idea for a series but the plot soon evolved into the typical crazed murderer (this one with an Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) motif and I lost all interest about two-thirds through--and stopped watching.  Character development was weak and stereotypic, acting was competent but not spectacular, and the script was clich&eacute;-ridden and shallow."
"I guess this was the Olivia show, with mom as her whipping post.  I'm nearly 60 and I don't believe I've ever heard a mother actually utter the phrase: &#34;She's still at the age where hitting is the cutesy phase&#34;.  Really?!!  I would love to see a show of hands as to how many adults think it's cute when you see a child slap an adult? This is one of the most extreme cases I've seen watching this program, but 80 percent of these 'parents'  allow back-talk, snarky attitudes, tantrums, etc.  Not all, mind you, buy enough that should concern us. These are the 'entitled' ones who believe it all needs to be handed to them on a silver platter.  It makes me ill to see how catered these children are, how foolish the adults are.  I'm not sure who needs a spanking more the kids or some of the moms.On the other hand, some of these young ladies show fabulous poise, good manners, and upbringing.  I do think that pageants, when viewed and done correctly can benefit those involved.  Maybe they need to test the mothers for maturity levels before allowing their children to enter,I like watching the older kids more, but it's something only tolerable in small doses,  Watch at your own risk! lol"
"Roy looks like a mountain man.  He's earned a bunch of patents, but his property in the Redwoods has all kinds of beat up cars on it.  He's accrued 20 MILLION in local fees.  Now clearly no one would be able to pay that.  ""Hoarders"" tries to clear his cars and their equipment gets stuck in the mud!  If this guy is such the genius, why doesn't he have a lab, rather than a heap of junk!?  The show never says if his hoarding hurt the redwoods or was in some way anti-green.Now Loretta was a trip!  She looked like Marla Gibbs on crack!  She was pregnant and the show concludes by saying she had a healthy baby girl.  Still, I'm seriously worried that the mother's nuttiness may hurt the child eventually.  Loretta didn't wanna throw away nothin'!  It was funny, and exhilarating, to see her sistah-gurl relative snap on her and walk off in disgust.  Her husband stood by her side, regardless.  He must have loved her strong, or just had extreme passive tendencies.  Many of the non-hoarding husbands on this show threaten to leave, but this guy never once indicates that he'd abandon his nutty wife.  Good for him, well, in a way!"
"Peggy Lee lives in Hawaii.  She has four children and a second husband.  She is an alcoholic.Peggy's first husband abandoned her two sons, but they chose to live with him when he returned.  This propelled her drinking, and her own mother was an alcoholic.  This reminded of Toni Morrison's ""Beloved,"" a book which begins by the main character's two sons leaving her house.I related to Peggy Lee because she often talks and yells to herself, with no actual audience.  Although I've never been diagnosed with alcoholism, I do that stuff too.  [Place embarrassment emoticon here.]  Peggy Lee babysits her grandson and it's a total accident waiting to happen.  I think more than Peggy could be punished by Children & Family Services if something bad did occur.Peggy Lee calls herself a fifth-generation Hawaiian.  I kinda wish she had stated what her ethnicity was.  I kept asking myself, ""I wonder if they're entirely Asian or a mix of Asian and Polynesian.""  Then again, Hawaiians of all kinds of backgrounds sometimes call themselves ""just Hawaiian.""I thought the show would end on a down note, but it ended positively, surprisingly."
"All pretty much the same after you've seen one.  I feel for these families, but I cannot believe they don't know they are about to be intervened! So much unreality to this reality show"
Leverage is getting to be a gamble to watch.  This one is slow and boring and I'm sorry I spent money on it. I hope they figure out that when people are paying per show they at least need to hold the viewer's interest.
"I've enjoyed watching this show for three seasons but this third season is problematic. Hank and his cohorts are all over the map. Also, the medical conditions are getting more and more bizarre.  This episode of the man passing out every time he gets in front of his new painting is a case in point.  The answer became so complicated that I began to lose interest.  This is also what is happening with the characters' lives. Plus there are now way too many characters and plotlines. Someone needs to put on the brakes with this series before it implodes,"
"The movie never developed a ""feeling"" for the characters, wasnt very scary, wasnt a well made movie in any manner and is so forgetable I had to click on it to remember the basic plotline....what little there was of it.I dont recommend this movie......at all"
"The movie is about a girl who has the ability to see the evil side of the person (they half-heartedly appear like those in Sixth Sense). After her mother is murdered, the girl and her father move from their apartment from L.A. to a  house in a quaint size town.  From there there the plot starts.  She ends up making a mischievous friend and befriends her elementary teacher.  She then begins to see a dead girl appear every once in a while and the mystery ensues.I was expecting a lot more out of this movie.  At the very least I was hoping for a small amount of build up or a bit of creepiness.  Both were lacking.  The suspense and climax is thin in this movie.  The story line is semi-obvious along w/ the prime suspect (villain).  I will rate this as a back-shelved Lifetime Network suspense movie.pjt."
"Season 1 was very entertaining, Season 2 was pretty good, but Season 3 demonstrates that Warehouse 13 has lost an indefinable something. Something has changed in the running/writing of the show that has lost some kind of synergy. Save your money, Amazon will have this on sale for 20 bucks soon enough."
"I watched one episode of Zen. The storyline and production value were high. The plot was interesting, and scenery great. But I won't be watching the other episodes. It didn't hold my attention very well."
"We see it over and over again with Horror, a film with a decent storyline, starts out great, and quickly descends into a pointless mess of blood and guts. The Shrine was a film I really wanted to like. I was intrigued by the Netflix description, and had they stuck with that story, maybe this one would have been a winner, unfortunately they didn't. The Shrine starts out by telling us of a student backpacking through Europe, who goes missing in the small town of Alvania, Poland. Some reporters from his hometown get a whiff of the story and start poking around, only to find out that no one in the town is particularly interested in trying to find this kid, that's when the reports decide the only thing they can do is go there and look for him themselves. With films like Saw and The Offspring, the gore was absolutely necessary and added to the story, in The Shrine, it takes away from what was already a pretty good story. The small town was creepy and the story really played to peoples fear of disappearing without a trace, while on vacation. The film may have been a little bit slow moving, but it was very intense and interesting until the last forty-five minutes. That's when it goes demonic and becomes nothing but one bloody body after another. For me, films like the Shrine are the most disappointing of all, because the writers didn't believe in their story and ultimately destroy it in order to get more viewers. The demonic slaughterhouse may have appealed to a larger audience, but it certainly didn't make this a better film."
"I thought it was going to be funny, but it was just inapropriate. The very first episode and I was like really?"
"OK, I admit it. Some of the episodes of this season were pretty interesting, including ""Aliens and the Old West"", ""Aliens and Evil Places"" and ""Aliens and the Founding Fathers"". But why do the producers blame everything on aliens??? Do they really believe that every paranormal happening on the face of the planet (our planet, that is) are caused by little green men from the Dog Star?Egyptian zoomorph gods, the bizarre ""suicide forest"" in Japan, Thunderbirds, Joseph Smith's meeting with Moroni, Serpent Mound in Ohio, the mysterious disappearance of a 19th century science fiction writer, even the founding of the United States (!)...everything is caused by literal aliens in literal, mechanical space ships. Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Walt Whitman are squeezed into the scenario, since they apparently believed in extraterrestrial life, while poor George Washington supposedly encountered aliens at Valley Forge?!A series *seriously* investigating the real or perceived paranormal events touched upon in ""Ancient Aliens"" might have been interesting, even if some of the stories would prove to be tall tales. Instead, we are forced to endure Erich von D&auml;niken's super-silly ""theories"" (yes, the old veteran is featured in several episodes), or watch long-debunked ""mysteries"" such as the Montauk monster (clue: it was a dog, but not from the Dog Star).I'm sure the sceptics reel every time they feel themselves forced to watch the ""History"" Channel, but why aren't the true believers up in arms against this pseudo-euhemeristic rubbish? Talk about killing a real mystery! Just blame it on the aliens..."
"This is quite a departure for what we used to know as History Channel programming.  I am open to new ideas, but this series often goes so far off the deep end as to be unwatchable.  This is season 3.  There are now into season 5.  5 SEASONS of this."
"Somewhat overstated and it becomes trite if you watch a few episodes.  A bit of this goes a long way.  Perhaps there was contact with aliens; perhaps not, but not everything can be explained with the theory that it has happened.  I quit watching as it got rather boring."
"Wanted to like this show about multinational Doctors working in a 'MASH' type hospital in the war zone of Afghanistan; but didn't. The premise has tons of potential and the Actors are all fine, but it just didn't 'grab me' and I'm a fan of most medical shows (House, Nurse Jackie). Sometimes its easy to think the networks are 'idiots' cause they cancel shows after 1 season that are really, really good and I love finding 'gems' like that on Amazon for purchase. And sometimes, they cancel a show like this--and I can see why. Its not horrible, its just not that compelling to spend time watching in my view and somebody else might love it!"
"At first glance, MAIN ST. would seem to have all the ingredients for an absorbing piece - a top-notch cast (with two Brits doing very creditable Southern accents), a strong sense of place (Raleigh, North Carolina), and a taut, spare script by veteran Horton Foote.  Then why is the movie such a disappointment?  Its subject-matter is a pertinent one: the decline of American urban life and the schemes hatched by entrepreneurs to regenerate it, which might not necessarily please the existing residents.  However John Doyle's production is particularly slow-moving: the camera spends a long time focusing on tight close-ups of the protagonists, especially Ellen Burstyn as Georgiana Carr.  This would be a perfectly acceptable strategy, were it not for the consciously showy nature of the performances: the actors are allowed to get away with the kind of theatrical gestures and facial movements that would not seem out of place in Victorian melodrama.  As a result, we end up not really caring about the characters at all.  Matters are not helped by the treacly soundtrack (from the normally reliable Patrick Doyle) that obtrudes itself on several occasions.  Perhaps the material might have been better if another director had handled it."
"Despite the superb acting this movie just did not cut it.Here are some of my random thoughts after watching it.Is it just me or is that the most miserable and unhappy town in America?Midway through the movie I was ready to stick my head into one of those toxic drums.The fact that a warehouse full of deadly toxic waste was being guarded by a couple of beer drinking Mexicans in lawn chairs was laughable.The scene where Auntie was suddenly overjoyed to move out of the only house she ever lived in was a mystery in itself.The weirdest part of the movie though, was when the toxic waste boss suddenly realizes that toxic waste is.......toxic.At the end when the guy announces he was quitting, Auntie is overjoyed to be moving out and everyone is in love, I was expecting a giant Wizard of Oz rainbow to be there when she opened the door and announced ""What a beautiful day!"""
"wow, great casthorrible scriptactors seemed lost trying to make sense of where to go with the scriptB movie, a shamecolin firth, god love him, great actor, but HORRIBLE southern accent..... geesh!!!and then the ending.... total deus ex-machina... all the sudden all is great and forgiven... PATHETIC...i hate blatant moral tale movies.... it's like the milagro bean field war on steriods.THUMBS DOWN"
"Horton Foote (1916 - 2009) ) was an American playwright and screenwriter, perhaps best known for his Academy Award-winning screenplays for the 1962 film To Kill a Mockingbird and the 1983 film Tender Mercies, and his notable live television dramas during the Golden Age of Television. He received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1995 for his play The Young Man From Atlanta. His last original screenplay as MAIN STREET: it is fortunate that he didn't live to see it produced.  MAIN STREET seems to have something to say - that the economic crisis has devastated small towns to the point of making questionable decisions out of desperation about improving their near ghost town status; that lessons from around the world (Chernobyl and Fukushima, etc) about toxic waste too often go unheeded; that flight of youth from small towns merely to seek change is not always emotionally convincing a decision: that family history and the accoutrements of same don't necessarily guarantee survival for descendants. And out of these plausible concerns could come a decent story, but here the result is flatline. In his film debut as a director John Doyle (known for fine productions of the operas Peter Grimes, The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, and the musical comedy Company) he fails to show a grasp of the use of film to tell a story and we are left with a stew of separate ingredients that seem almost immiscible.Durham, North Carolina is the setting - a town shrinking by the year because of lack of jobs and crumbling businesses - and the major (Isiah Whitlock Jr.) is desperate, deciding whether to schedule or move or cancel the annual parade from Thanksgiving to Christmas due to the town's lack of interest and depression.  Enter Gus Leroy (Colin Firth) who has rented a defunct tobacco warehouse from a town widow Georgiana Carr (Ellen Burstyn) to store canisters of Hazardous Waste awaiting transport to Vernon, Texas for burying: Leroy's apparent Ecology informed company offers the Durham city council the opportunity for economic resurrection.  Georgiana has misgivings about the rental and is faced with the fact that her trust fund form her wealthy father is depleted and she must consider selling the mansion in which she has lived since her birth.  She seeks advice form her niece Willa (Patricia Clarkson) who at first objects but on meeting Leroy falls for the man and the project.  As a sidebar another family faces changes: young Mary Saunders (Amber Tamblyn) is under the spell of her boss (Andrew McCarthy) but still loves her high school sweetheart Harris (Orlando Bloom), a young cop who is studying law at night and living with his depressed mother (Margo Martindale), urging Harris to 'go steady' with Mary and forget law school to stay in Durham.  The human factor enters: there is an accident of one truck hauling canisters (and event that changes the outlook of the wannabe entrepreneur Leroy), Mary's boss is married, and the concept of 'progress' in the decaying town of Durham changes along with the changes in the folk involved in the story.Aside from failing to involve the audience in the story or the characters, the conundrum is why would such a stellar cast of brilliant actors (Colin Firth, Patricia Clarkson, Ellen Burstyn, Orlando Bloom) sign on for such an obvious box office disaster (it is yet to be released)?  One can only assume that it was an homage to the memory of the brilliant writer Horton Foote.  It is a shame this screenplay is the last note of the legacy he left us. Grady Harp, August 11"
"Boring....slow to start, enjoy the main actor...Q from James Bond.  But the plot relies on fashion, music, kitsch....Don't think it will be around for long."
"taking too long to get into for my taste. did not watch the full first episode. but that said, could just be my taste. exceptional characters and acting and fabulous period set design and costuming."
I'm a big fan of a lot of British TV shows and I like Dominic West.  But I couldn't get into this show at all.  I really wanted to like it but it seemed to be dropping breadcrumbs all over the place and never picking them up.  I suppose I had the wrong expectations going into it.
"Honestly, I was confused by this episode and never figured out the point. It shows a mirror universe and that's it... nothing to tie it to the other universe or nothing to show how it ties to the rest of the episodes. I thought it would be like when DS9 had episodes for an alternate universe and they tied together but this wasn't like that at all. It seems like there should have been a Part III to make it all come together and make sense."
"Basically, an android figuring out her place in the world, and if she can have emotions. In the end, she becomes quite possessive of her human male friend.Strictly low budget. The special effects are not that great, but then, not many are needed. For the most part, this is an android story that's been told before (think Galaxina, all the way up the new Galactica Cylons). The acting is not that bad, only a couple of sets are even needed (a lot of the film takes place outside on an alien world).The female android is attractive in a simple way, wearing a bland black jumpsuit. Maybe by altering her outfit, the producer could have made the movie a bit more spicy. LOLAnyway, this film might be worth watching once, but that's about it."
"This movie was worse than a B movie.  The acting was terrible and it was mostly boring, boring, boring, boring."
"I started watching but quickly turned it off.  A laugh track, really?  The 80's called and they want their tv shows back.  The jokes weren't all that funny."
"Oh, NBC. We'll spare you the interrogation (that one could last for weeks). Instead, we'll let Whitney Cummings be your scapegoat, since she was bold enough to plaster her name and face all over your new series, Whitney.  At best, a cross between Fran Drescher and Audrey Hepburn, Cummings isn't without charm. Her raunchy antics elicit the occasional laugh in the show's pilot episode. Known for her recurring appearances on E!'s Chelsea Lately, she is the least likely choice of Handler's panel to helm her own series. This is especially so given a low concept like the one Whitney offers.It takes a whole lot of cool to rest solely on a personality for material. Unfortunately for Whitney, the cool points are obliterated by the laugh track that makes the show feel stale and dated. The episode begins with the disclaimer, ""Whitney is taped in front of a live studio audience,"" which feels like a desperate apology for the awkward format. Giving it the benefit of the doubt, the live audience might be present to poke fun at the traditional sitcom, or to capture the magic of Whitney Cummings's stand-up skills. The intent is far from clear or successful, and we are left wondering if we are laughing with or at Whitney.Whitney is flanked by a horde of stereotypical female friends that don't help her cause. However, the men in the ensemble redeem the show--counterintuitive, given the women's empowerment potential of a female-driven program. Maulik Pancholy (Weeds, 30 Rock) portrays a straight guy for a change, and he breathes fresh life into the show. As does the leading man, Chris D'Elia, who plays Whitney's quirky-cool boyfriend, Alex. D'Elia steals every scene, exercising a quiet and unconventional magnetism. We vote the show be renamed Alex; ""it all begins when Alex ditches his insufferable girlfriend, Whitney..."" Now, there's a hit show, NBC. Maybe Whitney will get better with age, but until she does, we're tuning her out.For more reviews, check out enter-detainment on blogspot!"
"Whitney Pilot [HD]copy of "" Friends"" ,  is not so bad, but many years watch shows like this , i need a break , ok!"
"I think Dick Wolf is spreading his talents too thin, both with CSI and this new season of SVU.  He is a genius at writing all these tales based on real issues, but the end of Season 12 (""Wet""} re: soda companies stealing/buying rights to limited water aquifers is too close to the idiocy going on now in NYC and elsewhere. Season 13, Episode 1 did not entice me at all to watch the next episode, although I probably will try again."
I only caught a few episodes of this while my girlfriend was watching it.  It's just not my thing.  Weird spur of the moment singing with awful pseudo-adult drama.
"Zooey Deschanel is a real talent and the ""awkward schtick"" that she does in this series is funny. A show built around her would definitely have promise, but this falls way short. The writing is flaccid and the comedy is often too broad. And the co-stars are nowhere near as talented as she and it ruins what could have been a great vehicle. But that's what happens when you choose a cast based on who's Jewish rather than who's the most talented.  I'm referring here to actor Jake Johnson (Jewish despite the Anglo name) and then most especially Max Greenfield who is not only awful and a total amateur, but is so homely it's genuinely painful to look at his face."
"not for me , not my type of show , try to sell this for the 18 years old females."
"This is like sci-fi without the sci or fi. Few sci-fi shows that I know of really last on TV when the characters involve children IMO. Perhaps Lost in Space worked but not Earth2, V or V2, etc. It ends up always being the same....kids do something stupid or silly and the parents come to the rescue. It may work for a two hour movie like Jurasic Park, but not a weekly series. I predict this will last less than half a season.It happened in the pilot (episode 1) and it will continue to happen. I couldn't even watch the last half of the show. Next episode I'm sure will be one of the kids takes in a friendly baby dino and the mother/father dino attacks the compound then the parents or kids hands over the baby and all is fine. kAnother episode, the kids get lost and have to deal with menacing dino's until the parents rescue them. Another episode and a parent gets hurt and the kid must tempt fate by venturing alone back to the compound to look for help. Another episode, the kids find friendly dino's who are being harassed by big bad dino's and parents help rescue the cute, friendly dino's. Blah, Blah, Blah.Heck, I was more interested in the world that they left rather than the world that they moved to in the time rift."
"OMG, this is almost un-watchable. I don't understand. Big name folks involved. $$ spent on effects and sets. You've begun with an interesting premise. But the story is garbage. Recycled garbage at that. Pushed along by hopelessly cliched dialogue. How sad. Who is the target market? Why is the leader doing an ""Aw shucks ma'am""/Marshall Dillon impression? There is no chemistry between the husband and wife. The sullen misunderstood teenager plot line has been done to death. Let it rest in peace! I guess I answered my own question. The target market are kids who are too young to recognize the cliches. To them it's new stuff. Okay... Well, I'm going to watch a Firefly episode to cleanse my pallet."
"Production values are good.  I love even okay westerns.  Struggled to finish this one.  Rather slow, completely pointless, and the direction of some quite capable actors is either non-existent or awful.  Real shame.  Underlying it all is a terrible script.  I do wonder what the makers of the film though was worth making about this movie.  Don't waste your time."
"The pilot was good, but it was downhill from then on. It has turned into a soap opera what with the mediocre acting on the part of most of the actors. It's a great plot, but well....too bad about everything else."
Another full year of Nikita and Percy playing cat and mouse. The ongoing chase becomes boring and predictable. If these folks are so highly trained and skilled how is it they cannot finish a job? This becomes laughable and greatly annoying.
"Ingredients: many swoshy sounds, light flashes between scenes, many raised eyebrows when someone says something ordinary, over acting, staged meetings with the boss man calling in via telephone, incredible leaps of logic, ill-logic.  Remember kids, it's not what you say, it's how enthusiastic you say it that makes something true!  Yaaaay!"
"This could be a really good show but it's too Hollywood with loud music, zip by photography and they drag everything out.  I stopped watching it after a few shows."
"Once again frontline takes a topic, that's been handled in 60 different ways and tries to convince you that they're doing something unique heroine is bad you will get addicted to it very easily and ruin your life. So now frontline tries to insert stories of collateral damage from Mr. brownstone my heart goes out to that girl and her family but couldn't you say using her stories entertainment is somewhat depressing I would not recommend this documentary for someone withdrawling from opium or any opium derivatives it will only make you feel worse and you don't need that at this juncture after two with three of these documentaries you've seen them all respectfully Johnny Irish"
"The movie reminded me a little of ""Paranormal Activity"" in that it has some hand held camera shots as well as using things like ""DAY NINE."" It reminded me of the classic ""House"" as there was a huge hole in the closet that apparently ""things"" were coming through.Danny Hill's grandmother dies in the opening scene. Danny (Van Hansis) becomes a squatter in her apartment on the advice of Joe, the Doorman (Thorsten Kaye) and Joe's lawyer friend. He wants the apartment for the same rent control price his grandmother had it. The landlord wants Danny out so he can rent the 3500 square foot, downtown NYC apartment for big bucks. Joe gets Danny everything he needs to stay there, unfortunately there are weird things going on in the apartment and Danny quickly develops cabin fever.The movie doesn't have a lot of characters and is practically a one man play. The movie plays you along to the end.F-bomb, brief night time sex, no nudity. 2 1/2 stars at best."
"What is it with so many incoherent screenplays these days?  This guy tries to survive slowly going insane in a creepy apartment because if he lasts long enough, he can have it to live in.  Okay...and it ends ironically and rather predictably. What is the point?"
"A young couple (Thandie Newton and Cillian Murphy) take a retreat to a remote island off the coast of England to rekindle the flame in their marriage.  There is a deafening silence between them and allusions to a stillbirth in the air.  All is going unswimmingly until an injured British soldier(Jamie Bell) washes up on their shore.  When he comes out of his unconscious state he relates a tale of an epidemic racing through Britain.  He heeds the couple to take the necessary precautions or face the consequences.  Is he angel or devil?  What do you think? An eight year old could have written a better script.  This thriller is totally bereft of suspense.  It telegraphs most of it's shocks(Look, Dear. I found a rifle.) rendering them meaningless.  Completely wasted is a genuinely menacing turn by Bell.  Just goes to show that the Brits can make formula garbage just like their American compatriots."
"Martin (Cillian Murphy) and Kate (Thandie Newton) are a married couple who go off and live on an island. She had a stillborn and the day after she came out of the hospital her husband was at work. In her blog she has a secret of her own she can't tell Martin (one that isn't worth waiting for). The house is huge and they have plenty of food and even electricity from a finicky basement generator and Internet access. Kate is distant and aloof from the start as Martin is the more likeable of the characters.Kate retreats to the bath and doesn't allow her husband to see her naked, as she appears extremely disturbed, blaming Martin for everything. Then suddenly a man in military fatigues, sinisterly armed with a pistol shows up on the island and passes out from his head trauma. Jack (Jamie Bell) the injured man recovers and informs Martin there is a deadly airborne virus killing off the world's population and is headed ""our way."" He wants to seal up the house which is on a cold remote island.The couple doubts Jack's story but have no way to verify it or leave the island. They are prisoners in their own house in a slow developing home invasion film. Twist at the end makes the whole film a waste of time.F-bomb, no sex or nudity."
"The acting was great but the movie felt like it was dragging on.  The drug use took away from character development and the plot was lacking.  With such a great cast, I was expecting something better.The sound track was good though."
"There are two questions one has to propose after watching an overwrought parable of a film like ""I Melt With You."" Is the movie any good? And is it worth watching? I know some who feel these answers are always the same, but I don't. If someone asked me if Mark Pellington's outrageous examination of middle-aged regret was good, I'd have to say no. So over-the-top and patently ridiculous, the movie is an absolute mess tonally and thematically (even to the point of morphing into a thriller for its conclusion). But is it worth watching? There's something to be said about the absolute madness of it all that makes ""I Melt With You"" sickly fascinating. Even as I was laughing at how inept the story line felt, the movie kept pushing into greater and greater outrageousness. And I must admit, there is an odd entertainment factor to be gleaned from this unpredictability. While it may not be a ""good"" movie, it patently refuses to back down and play it safe. I respect that as well. My rating, therefore, is divided. I give it one star on merit and three stars for its bold commitment to lunacy. Overall, I'll make it two stars and predict that this is the love-it or hate-it proposition of the season.The movie introduces four childhood friends who get together once a year for a week of insane debauchery. Without much preamble or development, we meet the guys briefly in their everyday lives before they assemble at an isolated chalet. Thomas Jane, Jeremy Piven, Rob Lowe, and Christian McKay play the quartet and it's clear that, as a whole, they've been a pretty privileged bunch. But looks can be deceiving, or so the screenplay would have you believe. Each man is haunted by regret and the life not chosen. Despite being successful professionals (some with families), the trip instantly devolves into a drug-fueled music video of bad acts and excess. The movie, in these early scenes, has so little plot momentum that it seems a repetitive (and rather silly) glorification of poor choices and a complete disconnection with recognizable humanity. As each man faces his supposed demons and idealizes a more innocent time, the movie slows down to hear their hard luck stories. But one tragedy and a childhood promise will forever change these men. I won't reveal any more than that, other than to say that the movie just gets systematically more loony as it progresses.With pulsing music, disjointed camera work, and absolute hysterics, the movie becomes a preposterous thriller. To their credit, the actors never waver and all serve up deliciously over-the-top interpretations of ""real"" people. I know some will consider the subject matter provocative and thought-provoking, but it's so far out there--you can't take any of it seriously. But by the time the film enters its final 45 minutes (and the great Carla Gugino shows up), the movie has jumped a school of sharks (not just one) to enter bad movie nirvana. It's so bad, it's good! I'm not sure how anyone would get deep meaning out of ""I Melt With You,"" although its central premise is sound enough. If you do, however, good on you! For me, it's a master class of excess that takes itself way too seriously and thus becomes an absolute treat for lovers of bad movie mayhem. Without the slow start, maybe I'd have rated this higher for the delirium! As is, though, I hated it AND loved it (but for all the wrong reasons), yet am hard pressed to actually recommend it. Despite those that will proclaim it some sort of modern masterpiece, there's a reason its critical consensus on Metacritic is 26 out of 100. KGHarris, 8/12."
"Mark Pellington's Sundance disaster, titled 'I Melt With You', is one of the strangest, incredibly maddening and tonally challenged films that I have seen all year. There are pros and cons - more of the latter than the former - and it is easy to see why so many critics have slashed it to bits. With that being said, it is certainly not as bad as everyone thinks it is, but it could have been a whole hell of a lot better.The film focuses on the yearly reunion of four friends who went to college together in the eighties. Every one of these individuals somehow failed to live the dream, and as a result, they have taken questionable paths in life. Over the course of a drug-filled week, the men reminisce on the past, proceed to wax philosophical on the present, listen to the music of their youth, party with girls, drink obscene amounts of hard liquor, snort mountains of coke, and pop every pill known to mankind. Between this foursome, moments of sobriety are extremely rare - the main characters remain intoxicated for at least two thirds of the running time.The 'Big Chill' meets 'Scarface' vibe comes to a screeching halt when one of the men, racked with guilt over the death of his lover, commits suicide - a tragic occurrence which is partially linked to a pact the four men made twenty five years ago, which all of them, save for one, managed to forget. You read that correctly. Twenty five years prior to this particular reunion, these boys made a binding promise to one another - a contract, signed in blood. When the film reveals exactly what the promise entails, it is a shocking discovery.This begins a downward spiral that neither one of them can escape. It is here that the tone of the film changes for the worse, and as a result, becomes more than a bit preposterous. The cast includes Thomas Jane, Jeremy Piven, Rob Lowe, and Christian McKay. The performances are hit (Christian McKay) and miss (just about everyone else, especially Thomas Jane).The first half of the film is pretty decent, and I was disappointed to see it devolve so quickly. What could have been an extremely provocative study of broken dreams and arrested development becomes a hopelessly melodramatic pile of drivel.Rated R, 122 minutes, directed by Mark Pellington, released by Magnolia Pictures. Available on Blu-ray and DVD on February 28th from Magnolia Home Entertainment."
"This is definitely a weak series. It's an interesting premise but I just found so much of it cliched and PC'd out it's hard to swallow. First of all the very silly idea that some ex-rebel soldier would chase various people, even be able to do that much after a chaotic war, in order to get revenge for his wifes death-GAG. The main character has such wooden acting it's hard to care much about anything he does, even cold blooded murder in revenge. Some ex-slave owner part of the despotic South is hard to have much sympathy for. Oh and he's a saint too he just pays the ladies of the evening for services not rendered because of his noble nature-GAG. This is all just blather.This IS a ripoff of Deadwood down to the 2 friends looking to make an enterprise in a dangerous place, the Irish film projectionists(see Deadwood if you don't know who I'm comparing them to). I could care less about them too. Ugh the PC cliches just abound here. Everyone's represented, the blacks, the Indians, the British heroin, the evil bossman and yes the wronged rebel so sad-GAG. Everyone gets their small piece of heaven in each episode here so we can all get our pre-ordained PC helping.For anyone used to watching the HBO/Showtime stuff this is just too weak and shallow. Now I'm sure all you people who bought this will disagree, of course if you bought it you disagree! Ever notice how that works? It's hard to be critical of your own choices or yourself isn't it?This review is not for those who have bought this(or are paid to give good reviews) it's for those looking for an honest opinion of this series who are thinking of watching it or buying it."
"I am a fan of historical fiction when it is done WITHOUT a political agenda. Good historical fiction sticks as close to the truth as possible to educate as well as entertain. Sometimes the writer needs to improvise to keep the storyline flowing--but it also should be as close to the truth as possible.The writers REPLACED the Irish immigrants who were the majority immigrant population who built the eastern portion of the railroad (along with Poles, Italians, Swedes and Germans) with arrogant &#34;in-your-face&#34; Farrakhan blacks. The Chinese who built the western portion are barely mentioned. I am an advocate of giving credit where credit is due and to write a series given blacks credit for what others have done I find insulting.I will not buy the politically correct Hollywood formula &#34;White/Black/Female&#34; second season."
"As much as Cullen Bohannon's adventures are interesting, and Colm Meaney's character is compelling, and Tom Noonan is just... wacko, sadly the show doesn't work as well as it should.The show, as another reviewer here pointed out, is DEADWOOD Light. It even uses many of the same tropes as that program did (mysterious and violent yet forthright man; naive yet beautiful recent widow; SOB boss who runs everything in the surrounding area; unconventional and troubled preacher), but that's nothing revolutionary to a Western. These are pretty common all around.The story of the building and connecting of the Transcontinental Railroad is pretty darned compelling, but obviously, that needs to be dressed up a little more: The Black and Irish workers, the side-businesses in the camp, the little pieces of subterfuge and manipulation; this is apparently the drama driving the show forward. Again, sadly, it's just not compelling enough to maintain interest for those who have seen this show before and seen it better cough*DEADWOOD*cough.While freshman showrunners Tony and Joe Gayton (who also wrote the somewhat-entertaining Dwayne Johnson/Billy Bob Thornton B-movie FASTER) deserve props for doing their very best to make this look and feel authentic, the characters and the story are just too bland and too stock (much like FASTER) and the performances, with a few exceptions, don't flesh them out further. I really wanted to like this show, too, since AMC has a few of the very best shows on TV right now. I DVR'd every episode and watched the first four, but everytime I thought about watching a new episode, I just felt like it was a chore, and that is not the feeling you want when you sit down to watch TV. Oh, well."
"Five mountaineers in the Scottish Highlands inadvertently get involved in a crime when they rescue a kidnapped Serbian girl in the woods. Following the tradition of thriller genre that is best represented by John Boorman classic ""Deliverance,"" Julian Gilbey's movie ""A Lonely Place to Die"" starts out promisingly, but rapidly descends into a series of nonsense.I can generally ignore plot holes as long as a film is good enough to entertain us. Unfortunately, ""A Lonely Place to Die"" is not good in most aspects. Action is mostly derivative with cardboard characters that cannot make a sensible decision even when ""villains"" are not around. Melissa George plays Alison, a seasoned mountain climber who should have known that climbing down a cliff is not a very good idea when some criminals responsible for the girl's imprisonment might be back in any minute.The film ditches its original idea of the cat-and-mouse thriller in the Scottish mountains in its third act, where things get even more ridiculous and confusing. Without spoiling much, all I can say is that a third party arrives in the climax that is padded out with drawn-out dialogues and unexciting action sequences involving guns.Obviously there is the potential for an intense thriller, which seems buried somewhere in ""A Lonely Place to Die."""
A really boring soft-core porn film rather than a French art film.  As best I can tell there was no plot.  if you're looking for a god foreign film pass this one up!!
"Just what we need.  Another deeply depressing downer about dealing with the death of a child.  This time we have Ethan (Thomas Dekker from TV's ""Terminator: The Sarah Conner Chronicles""), a 20 something dad who has custody of his 3 year old son.  He is divorced from his alcoholic, skanky sleep-around wife (Lynn Collins).  The film is set in the fictitious Angels Crest, Montana (filmed in the Alberta Rockies), occupied by a small but close community of gorgeous people, at least all that are under 50.The town has a diner where everyone gathers and exchange gossip about each other.  The diner is run by Angie (Mira Sorvino), the sympathetic big sister type.  We know we are in for rough sledding early on when Ethan takes his 3 year old out into the wilderness to build a snowman.  The poor kid falls asleep and dad decides to leave him in the truck and track down some deer.  I mean, there is all kind of wildlife in this mountainous region, but you would think this guy had never seen a deer.  When Ethan returns to the truck 10 or 15 minutes later, the kid is gone.  Somehow he had managed to escape his car seat, roll down the window and escape.Well, there is no happy ending and it is hard to not feel for the poor schmuck as you would anyone.  No one in town feels anything but sympathy including the town lesbians played by Elizabeth McGovern as the former straight, married with-a-son one and Kate Walsh in all her butchiness.  Then there's Cindy's (Collins) mother the Evangelical and Jeremy Piven as the D.A. who is going to prosecute Ethan.  Jack (Piven) it seems has a past of his own.  Something about losing his only child, but we never learn the particulars.  Then there's the best friend of Ethan who has also been sleeping with Cindy.  Whew!  There's more but you get the idea.In a tragedy play like this, the director got too involved with the numerous characters.  In addition, some of the scenes are just ridiculous.  In one, Jack the prosecutor (Piven) shows up at a potential witness's house wearing one of those furry hats with the earflaps that tie...and it never comes off.  In another, Ethan decides to take Angie's three year old daughter for a ride in his truck without telling her.  This is after his son dies!  Are you kidding me?  Anyway, forget this film unless you want to go into a manipulated deep state of depression, albeit with some beautiful snowy Rocky Mountain vistas.  A much better, but similar themed movie of this nature is Atom Egoyan's ""The Sweet Hereafter"" (1997)."
"My wife and I found this movie to be quite boring.  The acting was OK, but the author left something to be desired."
"Every show has interesting things that come into the Pawn Shop.  However, I am extremely tired of the jousting, barbs and insults form the Old Man (especially), and that Rick never has a good job or good word for Cory or Chum.  I've stopped watching almost.  I don't watch nearly as much as I did in the past."
I really enjoy seeing trinkets and treasures coming out and the value put on them.  But I cannot stand the pompous attitude that pervades the show through the slob characters.  It's so bad that I just turn the program off midway.  I'll take American Pickers and the storage war people over the Pawn Stars any day any time.
I think it's boring but the Mr. likes it.  Not much changes from episode to episode.  It must be a guy thing.
"Explanation For Lower Rating:I'm not sure what the History Channel is doing with their DVD releases this year, but it is certainly a step in the wrong direction. When they released ""Pawn Stars: Volume Three,"" many people assumed that the show would be Season Three as the other two seasons of the program had been released in their entirety. It was, in fact, only sixteen episodes. When they released ""American Pickers: Volume Two,"" it was the same thing. Season One had been released with all episodes, but this Volume Two was only eight episodes of Season Two. I know some people that preordered sight unseen, or just weren't paying attention, felt a little shortchanged by these smaller portions as opposed to what they had assumed were full season DVD releases. Personally, I didn't agree with the decision but, at least, the DVD packaging was very clear about what was included. Anyone who read the box knew what to expect: how many episodes and which ones, so it wasn't a blind investment!Now here's a leap backwards for ""American Pickers,Volume 4.""I am sitting here with the DVD in hand and nowhere does it say how many episodes are inside. Never mind that it doesn't list them (which in my opinion it should if it is not a Complete Season package), it doesn't even tell you how many episodes you are getting. I suppose I'm supposed to look at the running time and do some estimated mathematics? I know this may seem trivial to some or that I'm overreacting, but I think the company owes potential buyers this information. My lower rating, therefore, reflects the History Channel's (or A&E; Networks distributing) apparent disregard for its own fan base. I don't like to make purchases without knowing exactly what I'm paying for!  It's not the price (which is in line with the contents), it's the lack of information that bothers me.I, however, will tell you what is inside. The 2 DVD set has eight episodes, a chronological continuation of Season Two for just shy of six hours worth of programming.  Really, how hard would it have been to include the fact that there were eight episodes on the DVD box?Season Two: (1) Fairlane Fever, (2) Too Hot To Handle, (3) Trading Up, (4) The Emu Chase, (5) Keep Out!, (6) They Boldly Go, (7) The Possum Trot, and (8) California Dreamin.  There are no special features, but there are Spanish and English subtitle options.The premise, for anyone unfamiliar with the show, is that two ""pickers"" (Mike Wolfe and Frank Fritz) travel the country trying to unearth hidden treasures from the various people they meet along the way. Some of the items may have historical significance.  That's the angle the History Channel uses to tie the show into its lineup. In truth, the show has similar appeal to the classic ""Antique Roadshow"" mixed with the treasure hunting gamble of ""Storage Wars"" with a dash of ""Hoarders"" thrown in for good measure. It's always intriguing to see what long forgotten gems might be lurking in someone's garage or junkyard. Along the way, the boys chat up the locals and experience a different kind of Americana.  An interesting show, but fans deserve some respect in these DVD releases.  KGHarris, 8/12."
"Why people should expect a movie to emulate a book makes no sense. They are totally different mediums with their own strengths to be taken advantage of and weaknesses to be avoided. They are separate stories that share a common bond. Example: I thought ""Help"" was better as a book (actually what my imagination created) than as a movie but the movie had it's acting strengths.As far as ""Bag of Bones"" it was too formula driven and loaded with stereotypes. Usual writer searching for inspiration; loses wife; goes to rural Maine (of course); encounters murder mysteries; has dreams; has romantic affair; things turn inexplicably on and off; windows/doors/drawers open & close; bad townsfolk are hiding a secret; spirits appear; spirits lose power when dug up. Help! How repetitively redux.Acting was OK but dialogue sounds like it came from a too cloistered Hollywood writer - simply not realistic conversations. CGI effects of ghostly dead people was standard '40s movie making boring. Some effects were more laughable than scary such as lightning hitting a sign which happens to land on and kill some townsfolk (cheaply shown as an old pickup catching fire) and a tree that looks sort of human shaped that gives a jolt when touched, finally a CGI face appears on the trunk while a branch or two take a swat at our hero-writer (the trees in ""Alice..."" and in ""Wizard of Oz"" were scarier)."
"This lost my attention ten minutes in. It was stupid, flat and boring and I never finished it. It didn't live up to Steven King's other works."
"That's about it.  He is engaging, but the rest of it is actually a dull slog despite the storyline, violence, and other characters.  Too bad.  I am sure the book was better; I read it some time ago, since I always read King's work."
"If you must watch this I would say watch teh first half and turn it off, as soon as you hit the horrorifying slaughter house footage, its downhill.This could have been a really powerful wonderful documentary but instead decided to be over the top Peta ad.All the hidden footage of animals in slaughter houses are not given enough context.Go watch Forks over Knives you will learn more."
"I used to watch this show a while ago, the first two seasons.  Viewing it as a therapist, it is a sad show and not really that funny."
I was disappointed with Seasn 5 episode 1. Not nearly as fun or clever as previous seasons. Just not up to snuff
"My child will watch anything YGG.But, Tori Spelling - pregnant - with tunic riding up in back?That's worse than getting hit in the face with a snowball.Every time I see the show, I know behind it all, there aredads laughing.Leslie and Tori, we can tell you were dressed bymen cutting fabric with safety scissors, who let their daughtersdo your makeup. But have some pride ladies,little girls are watching!"
"I watched the very first episode but decided that enough was enough. Over the last 8 seasons I have watched as this show has went from interesting paranormal research to scripted reality. This episode was no exception. I have no words on how disappointed I am in Grant and Jason. When the show started they presented Ghost hunting in a positive light. With proper ways to investigate and going to real people's homes. Now they just look like abunch of bafoons. Jason never believed in everything they heard/saw, but now he cops to anything. It use to be personable and watchable, now it's just a joke. They 'jumped the shark' when they brought in the ghost hunting dog. Thanks Grant and Jason for destroying something I loved all in the name of ratings!"
"This is one ""horror"" that fails to deliver on all counts.  While there was a brief period in the first half when I thought the film contained a substantial amount of atomsphere that I'd probably be able to end up giving the movie 3 stars, unfortunately it never improves.  The nonsensical communication between the two main characters ends up wandering WAY too long and thus, completely destroys all potential this movie had.  I fully expectd an improvement in storytelling to eventually occur but, again, it never comes.  Basically other than the surprise ending, the Innkeepers disappoints.It's about the character of Sara Paxton roaming around a hotel with a haunted history.  She apparently works there at night.  A computer-obsessed geeky guy plays the role of the second biggest character and he works behind the counter... I guess.  He spends most of his time on the computer or sleeping upstairs so his job is really easy.  He's more like an arrogant know-it-all that never wins me over that's for sure, whereas Sara is more of a curious almost jaunty teenager constantly on the alert and jumping around at the slightest bumps she encounters in the night.  The other characters that occasionally enter the picture (such as the old woman in the room upstairs and the curious old man that wants a specific room because it contains memories) never accomplish anything meaningful and simply feel tacked on for the sake of character diversity.Well apparently this old hotel is haunted, so Sara spends all her time walking around exploring at least half of the rooms.  Most of her time is spent in the main room downstairs.  However, the problem is that (despite a complete lack of atomsphere and horror of course) on several occasions, Sara and the geeky guy basically mock the supposed hauntings taking place here, and the scene with the two of them pretending to investigate a real haunting only to hide under the sheets and rise like a ghost was the breaking point for me- the Innkeepers HAS to be 2 stars.  If you're going to mock horror *in* a supposed horror movie, you're going to fail miserably.  Simple as that.The little bit of blood and suspense during the final 10 minutes isn't the least bit frightening either.  The surprise at the end *is* pretty good at least.  Unfortunately by that point, you have to sit through over 80 minutes of boring, plotless nonsense so overall it really is a dud of a film.  Avoid."
"For months leading up to my viewing of this film, all I heard was how clever and creepy and worth-my-time it is.  Am I missing something?  This seemed like pretty run-of-the-mill stuff.  I agree with many fans of Ti West that he is a talented director who knows how to exercise restraint (House of the Devil was really good) and give his films character.  However, despite the good direction, atmosphere and acting, I can't get past the fact that the ghost story in The Innkeepers was nothing I haven't seen before.  Unless, like I said, I missed something.  I watched this with a good friend whose opinions are pretty close to my own, and he agreed with me that House of the Devil was much better than The Innkeepers.  If you're a fan of this type of ghost story, and you're a bit older than the twenty-something set (like me), then you've probably spent a lot of time watching ghost stories just like this.  Throwing a bit of ambiguity into the story near the end didn't do much to help its plot, either.  I don't know, maybe someone out there can tell me what's sailing over my head because I just don't get why so many people are rallying around this movie.  I just felt it wasn't that good even though I really, really wanted to like it."
"I was looking for a good horror movie, that fell under the radar, to promote for halloween, and I was told that the Innkeepers was that film, but it wasn't. This film is so clique, stealing almost everything from other films of the same genre. They had the nerve to give this movie an R rating and call it the must see horror movie of the year, but truthfully, its slightly more scary than a Disney movie! An old hotel is going out of business and the two remaining employees decide to investigate the long history of ghost sightings at the establishment. There are only a couple guests, giving them the perfect opportunity to investigate. The only thing this film uses in order to frighten you is random things jumping out at you, which most of the time aren't what you expect them to be. There is also a creepy old woman staying there who can talk to the spirits and predict the future, but if that isn't bad enough, there is of course the investigations themselves. Using nothing but a s***ty old tape recorder, they go looking for EVPs, using every phrase and question they could steal from Ghost Hunters. Yeah, the Innkeepers really is that ridiculous and the only really shocking thing about this movie is that someone actually gave it an R rating! Was the MPAA associate a little girl or elderly woman, because honestly, Monster House was scarier than this thing was."
"""The Innkeepers"" is a thinking person's ghost story. That is what the latest effort from writer/director Ti West (""The House of the Devil"") attempts to be. He would not resort to such familiar tricks as gores and loud noises to scare his audiences. That is a good thing. Unfortunately, the premise of ""The Innkeepers,"" good as it is, ends up being poorly executed. In short, the film is atmospheric and sporadically scary, but all in all tedious.""The Innkeepers"" centers on two hotel clerks Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) working for The Yankee Pedlar Inn that will close down soon. The hotel, it is rumored, is haunted by the ghost of Madeline O'Malley, a bride who died a tragic death many years ago. Claire and Luke, both enthusiastic about ghost stories and other paranormal activities, Claire and Luke, start investigating the legendary ghost, equipped with ghost hunting gear.Ti West as director employs a slow-burn approach for the first hour or so, keeping the pace deliberately slow with false alarms. That is not a bad idea. Then, while he ratchets up the tension towards the climax, he also leaves the interpretation of several key events open to our imagination. The problem is, most viewers would lose interest in what is going on before the film finally gets interesting.""The Innkeepers"" takes too much time in setting up the characters and the inn's back stories. Claire is a college drop-out who does not know what she wants to do, while Luke is a self-proclaimed paranormal investigator. Besides that, not much is revealed about them. With the arrival of former actress Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis) as a guest, who gives a warning to Claire, the story finally knows where it should go.Even then, without a compelling storyline and teasing details, the film keeps us waiting for the climax that is pretty good. Until then ""The Innkeepers"" is all about suggestions and insinuations about what to come in the end, but the characters' motives remain unclear and unconvincing, and the suggested mysteries are not intriguing. Not saying everything is a time-tested technique to build interest and tension, to be sure, but taking too much time to do so (and saying too little for that matter) is a different thing."
This movie was so dull and plodding that I could barely stay awake.  It took much too long for anything at all to happen and then the payoff was dissatisfying.
"Excuse the cheesy line, but I'm Not Jesus Mommy isn't a good film. The film is about Kimberly who decides to impregnate herself with a stolen clone because she's not capable of having children. The film quickly jumps around from her impregnation, 9 months after that, then another 7 years after that to the apocalypse; poor storytelling throughout the film may leave you lost. The story really doesn't bother explaining much. It's a slightly interesting story but the acting is terrible. Kimberly, the mother character, has no emotion in her acting and all of her dialogue sounds terrible; no heart whatsoever in her acting leading to a painful-to-watch performance, she has some potential though. Also, if you watched the teasers/trailers you might be expecting a film similar to The Omen, but it really has only a few similarities.However, I did enjoy the music in the film a lot. Also, David, the child, was often genuinely creepy. I didn't dislike this film because of its scientific or religious elements; I dislike this film because it's simply a poorly executed movie.I do not recommend directly paying to watch I'm Not Jesus Mommy. If you must watch this movie, it is available on Netflix streaming as of 6/17/12 to save some money."
"Rainbow flag men and boys have so many barriers and biases to face.  Richard dealt with his dear sister's death and being molested for years without others knowing.  He's had it tough, but he still ends up being a jerk here.He kinda reminded me of Andy Bell of Erasure, except I have nothing but respect for Mr. Bell.  Richard did some activist/non-profit work; I'm guessing he had anti-drug resources that he didn't bother to access.  Yes, his brother is/was homophobic, but he seemed more understanding of Richard than the other way around.  He is sucking his mother dry of money.  The work never mentions HIV/AIDS, but he engaged in lots of activities that I would imagine could put him in great risk.My favorite part of any ""Intervention"" episode is when the addicted person walks into the hotel room and sees their loved ones.  Richard wasn't even brave enough to stay.  You never really see him for the rest of the episode.The episode ends by saying Richard is no longer on drugs.  I highly doubt that.  He just seemed very nasty and abusive.  I can't imagine him staying sober.  He really needs to do nicer things so he can get some good Karma.  Otherwise, he's in BIG, BIG trouble!"
"This British indy film had received a lot of attentions and favorable reviews, mainly from British film media.The film has a simple story about 2 semi-professional(?) contractors received orders with a ""kill list"".The first 3 acts are alright with a good cast but the last act is too slight to make it a good and satisfyingthriller and doesn't justify the foregoing grisly violence."
"gotta say the first 65 percent of the movie is a classic slow burn. wonderfully shot, written and acted. loved the dinner scene. loved the intrigue. loved the mystery.....again, slow burn...that said : the movie, out of nowhere and at the worst possible time takes a complete change of course and...im not gonna ruin it...becomes way too symbolic and surreal to be entertaining. im all about having a deeper meaning in films...but this one just rams its ideals down your throat and tries very hard to be intelligent.shame. the director has a good thing going and then decided to insult the audience by going back to film school and make a pretentious ending. if i wanted to rent Eyes Wide Shut i would have...this movie could of been a game changer for horror movies for years to come but settled on cliche."
"I could watch this movie three more times and still not understand it, no, I don't think I could ever understand it."
I just like to listen to the theme song and then i turn it off. if you have seen three episodes you have seen enough.
"Perfect Sense is perfectly awful. It's about a chef (Ewan McGregor) and an epidemiologist (Eva Green), two people who go for each other but who have major relationship problems. They find themselves in the middle of a worldwide epidemic -- after crying a bit people lose their sense of smell. Then taste. Then hearing. Then sight.What can the world do? What can humanity do? What can Michael and Susan do? The answer, my friend, is written by a deeply earnest screenwriter and filmed by an otherwise interesting director: Love each other...take care of each other...trust each other. All this is accompanied with a deeply serious voice over that makes sure we understand the importance of what we see, along with a music score that drips with tragedy and then hope.To watch an infinitely better movie by the same director and also  starring Ewan McGregor, try the excellent and unpleasant Young Adam."
"There are interesting ideas in ""Sense,"" and the performances are uniformly excellent, as is everything from the sets to the musical score, but I found it ponderous, pretentious, and ultimately unappealing.  Another reviewer said it's hard to categorize, and that's true, although not necessarily a bad thing.  Pressed to find a category in which to put ""Sense,"" I list it withChildren of MenandBlindness, which to my mind were both superior films to this one.  I think what ""Perfect Sense"" might have been TRYING to be more like isNever Let Me Go, which is in every way better than ""Perfect Sense.""  If you haven't seen ""Never Let Me Go"" yet and have a choice between that and this--do yourself a favor and go with ""Never.""  (But if you're in the mood for sluggish sensuality and diffuse prettiness, you could do much worse than ""Perfect Sense""--if you can stand being merely engaged rather than rapt, it will do.)"
"This may be a promising, interesting series but the accents are so pronounced, it is irritating to try to watch since I don't understand half of what is said....not a good idea on series needing to figure &#34;who dun it!&#34;"
"The stories aren't bad, its the principal character that's the pain.  Granted it is season 1 and everyone is trying to find their feet.But, Vera is bad tempered all the time and borderline abusive.  The series is as much to do about Vera and her quirks as it is thesolving of crime.  If you like police stories where the DCI is a misery guts, then this is for you.  I prefer my stories with a lot more class like &#34;Lewis&#34;.  You can't go wrong with &#34;Lewis&#34;!"
"I don't like it but the kids do and they learn to find things or put things together or count. it's just annoying to me. the voices, the characters especially door mouse who is always negative."
I love Pawn Stars and we don't get that particular channel where I just moved so I thought I would watch this as a substitute. It is similar but just didn't have the specialness that goes along with their Las Vegas kin.
"As we began to watch there was interest in the characters and various logging technics. It was the attitude of one boss inparticular that turn us to turning it off. A small big mouth, large temper guy who physically shoved down threatened and also choked co-workers. To serious an occupation for such an immature person. Done watching!"
"This show used to be everything one could hope for in Reality TV.  The characters were real, the setting was real, the &#34;action&#34; showed real process.Sadly, with this season, the producers rolled out a new over-wrought title block and a new production outline that has substituted fakey acting and dialog for the old idea of showing the process of &#34;Restoration&#34; at which they used to be so good.Now the show has devolved to be just another gabfest, and largely a waste of time.Its just sad."
I've rated this once  Nice voices but not a lot of change in plots  Love the voices and the new
"At this shows VERY BEST it`s a 4 stars and at it`s least? 2 stars and that`s being Generous. Now.. if i was from NYC amd REALLY REALLY loved it then i MIGHT give it 3 1/2-4 stars but i am not from NYC. I did have to live there for 2 yrs but that hardly makes me a New Yorker, sorry :)Decent Characters and Decent writing gives the show 3 stars! I had it at 2 stars but at the last mnute raised it to 3. It`s certainly not horrible and I have gotten through Most of the shows uninterupted but i would not go out of my way or miss anything to make sure i watched this.NOW, mst of the Can`t miss shows are the first few seasons of Nurse Jackie but Mainly........ SHAMELESS! Now thats a show that is almost a crime to miss. I have NEVER EVER seen a show or movie that had so many great Characters, Young or Old (I am 53 Years OLD) and the writing, the City and Photography is unbelievavable!!! It would be a ""SHAME"" if their were not 10 seasons of this show made. Not many 1 Hour shows can grab every second of your sttention but this one can.Thats why so may shows are 1/2 hour ones today!!These shows are Way different but put this up there with ""The Wire"", most of ""The Sopranos"", ""OZ"" and so far..... Most of nurse Jackie and Weeds in shows that have Great Characters of all ages, wonderful writing,Almost always Believable in some way, Great Photography ad wonderful all around entertainment!!My Honest suggestion would be to buy or ""Get"" the 2 seasons of Shameless already available and one of any of the others i have mentioned if you have not seen them and start watching. You will end up with all of seasons of all of them and wont be able to wait for the next seasons!!!! That is of course, if it is not finished already.WARNING!!!!This can end up taking alot of your time."
"I love this show.  I watched every episode from season one and have watched every episode of season two except for the last one.  It is still on my DVR and I want to savor it; it ended too soon.Given the fact that season one is not yet available in Blu-Ray, I purchased the entire season at Amazon Prime only to find out that the $30.00 I was charged for season one in HD was not in HD at all.  It was easy to tell by the noticeable lack of sharpness and detail in the picture and my A/V receiver, which even tells me what type of sound (Dolby Pro-Logic II, Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital+, Dolbt Tru-HD, etc ) is being provided by the program material indicated that the sound was only Pro Logic II.  The was a blatant rip off, only compounded by the fact that it has all since become available free for Amazon Prime subscribers.  This is what it is worth: nothing - nothing, that is, beyond the subscription price, a subscription I have made good use of and will continue to do so.  I am just angry and disappointed that something was misrepresented in this way.And yeah, I am a crazy enough fan to purchase both seasons on Blu-Ray, once they become available.  Amazon Prime, in this one instance, did me wrong."
"Is this a series with a story line that gets divulged through the episodes? Or a drama in which each episode has a self-contained story? I do not know and I suspect that the producers/directors don't know either. In an attempt to promote a second season, the ending is totally unexpected and leaves you with a feeling of &#34;job not done&#34;."
"The basic idea for this plot is somewhat interesting and the acting okay.  Personally, I am weary of women detectives who look like they stepped out of a fashion magazine but who despite their youth and beauty are presented as hard-as-nails veterans.  Just not believable.  Let's get some mature, imperfect women in these roles."
"Revised April 7, 2012 EPISODES 1-13The action is okay, the animation is pretty good, the effects and sound are good and the music isn't bad but in the end this hero's journey is just too demoralizing.  The story is supposedly about Blade search for vengeance for his mother's death but while Blade has touching farewells with relative strangers, the farewell he had with his mother under similar circumstances was horrible creating an awkward comparison and severely diminishing the resonance of Blade's mission.Blade is depicted as needing to be rescued so often he sometimes becomes a secondary character in the series.  He is stomped emotionally, physically and even literally at crucial moments.  Tough fights?  Great.  Constantly getting beat down when it matters most?  Pass.  Blade has some good points, but the first installments will only be entertaining to those who enjoy watching the hero being crucified and the thirteenth episode will be even more bizarre than it is without them.Hold your holy water and wait for the next story arc."
The story line is getting more interesting BUT way too much unnecessary gore!  Not sue why they feel the need to directly show all that.
"I was hoping to see some complexity to the issues and lifes that intertwine in this series, but was disappointed to see the same ol thing. The writers apparently are not willing to consider that other perspectives would add a &#34;real-life&#34; element and interesting depth to the obvious biases they have bought to the table that have already played out in the first two seasons. I doubt I will continue watching - a real snoozer now."
i thought this was going to be way better but it was a fat guy eating then just loosening the weight but people still hated him because of ruinning a wedding so it was not worth watching
"Predictable, production values average, acting the same.  Perhaps it is the tennis theme that has the other reviewers so enthused.  I, however, would not recommend this to others: the trajectory of the story line is so stereotypical of many teen movies out there with a lot better talent."
This show is informative but extremely boring. It seemed to drag.  We did not make it through the first showing.
"This is typical psuedo-documentary style fluff. There wasn't much information that was well verified or documented. Wish there was more hard facts instead of speculations. History is interesting, speculation is boring."
"I loved &#34;Heroes&#34; so I thought &#34;Touch&#34; would continue this writer's success.  However, while it does have some attractive carryovers from Heroes -- most notably realistic-seeming foreign locales and (subtitled) dialogue, it verges on self-parody right out of the gate.  The excellent Kiefer Sutherland has to work really hard with a woefully underwritten part and can't get the character to be believable.  Too many scenes of his following his autistic kid and yelling: &#34;Jake, Jake, don't go there!  Jake. Jakle, come back!  Jake, Jake, be careful!&#34; led me to stop watching after the third episode."
"I was trying to figure out why I don't engage with this show - I enjoyed (some of) Tim Cring's Heroes series and Touch follows a similar theme of extraordinary results from an everyday hero. I also liked the pilot but by the fourth episode had completely lost interest. I'll also confess that I'm not a fan of the 'network narrative' genre where Hollywood can manufacture a story line based upon on the coincidental eventual meeting point of a handful of strangers.I think there are a couple of problems. The first is the mathematical theme - it just doesn't make sense to extrapolate a Math 101 understanding of the Fibbonaci sequence and the Butterfly Effect to give a mute child near psychic powers to predict where the lives of a random bunch of strangers will meet. It comes across as really manipulative and far-fetched. The second is that Keifer has little to do other than act like Lassie's owner, trying to make sense of cryptic messages from a child that won't speak, while filling the dialog gap with cries of ""Jake! Jake! Jake!"" every other scene.So Touch is a sentimental show more along the lines of Highway to Heaven (whoa, dig out the history books) than anything particularly scientific as it pretends to be. And after four episodes the plot didn't move forward enough to really capture my attention."
"""Touch"" has characteristics of a well-crafted TV drama; namely, well-developed characters and a premise which is unique and initially engaging. However, once all the components of the story are assembled, the result is dull and contrived. Ultimately, everything will work out because the numbers say so. That's about it. So the viewer is basically promised some sort of magical happy ending from the get-go. The numbers are little more than an omnipotent deus ex machina, and there's no real mystery, wonder, or drama to the plot resolutions they achieve. All this makes for a boring and saccharine hour of television that really isn't worth investing in."
"This is a well-made Korean horror movie that had lots of potential but it doesn't know when to quit. The idea behind it isn't bad, the setting is great. But it loses all its punch because of an ending that seemingly goes on forever."
"Francesca Annis especially was simply the wrong choice to play Tuppence. She looks more than 40 years old, rather than a young 20-something woman. Her partner, whose name I can't remember at the moment, was also too old. It made the shows leaden and ridiculous rather than light and fun."
"Personally I did NOT care for this movie, and would not recommend it to anyone.  However. I truly hated ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and that did well with the younger crowd so maybe you have something here."
I applaud the effort put into this movie and am editing my review after further consideration. The uniqueness of the girl's talent needs upgrading. I believe that would go a long way in increasing interest.
"Get on a boat, look for croc, find croc, shoot in the head. Repeat. The entire thing! At one point there is a storm lol."
Not my kind of comedy. I think that the younger generation may like this more. The whole concept is very thin.
It hasn't been that long since I rented this movie and I have already forgotten the thing. That might provide a clue as to how good a movie this is. I streamed it via Roku after paying Amazon for the privilege and though I think I paid less than $3.00 to rent it I still feel a bit ripped off.I cannot recommend this movie in any way.
"This could have been a really good sci-fi movie, but it attempts to be ""Dawn of the Dead"" at the end.  And fails miserably.  It's more watchable than the Sci-Fi network's wreck of the week, but not by much.  Good actors hamstrung by an awful script.  Actually, I may have to take that Sci-Fi statement back.  At least you know what's going on, (and probably know the whole movie), within the first few minutes.  This piece of dreck doesn't seem to know where it's going or what's it's all about until half way through this slog.  Confused about the first 2 minutes of the film?  Don't worry.  It ties back in somewhere toward the end.  Assuming you want to wait that long to find out.  Even if it was free, you're better off re-watching ""Night of the Living Dead"".  You'll feel dead after watching this crap."
"Dr. Andrew Stanton (Brian Krause) Is a confident and successful ER doctor. He is also working on a cure for AIDS. ( I smell Nobel.) He has a beautiful wife (Sierra Fisk) and daughter (Islay Vermillion) he needs to spend more time with. Just as when things are going his way, his life turn upside down as he accidentally creates a bacteria that makes people aggressive and is highly contagious.Now I know this sounds like a great zombie-type film and it would have been if it hadn't taken up nearly the whole film to develop. As it was we had a slow moving drama/thriller with a touch of horror at the end that wasn't worth 60 minutes of character development.Available on a 30 Horror Film Collection.Parental Guide: No f-bombs. Sex and brief nudity (?)."
"This movie was not so good, acting was not so good, loud music throughout the movie could not hear the actors, this movie looked like a B movie so since of realism."
"This is an interesting storyline set in an intriguing and potentially engaging environment (the Amazon).  The characters lack individual story motivation and seem one dimensional.  What was lacking was a more thorough and realistic integration of the already intriguing elements surfacing in the Amazon jungle and rivers . . . these mysteries alone would have served as the seeds of some incredible plot points.  I wanted this to be so much more than it was.  I would recommend FRINGE and PERSON OF INTEREST or WAREHOUSE 13 as excellent choices for the type of intrigue, character development, and intrigue that cement stories in your imagination."
"I'm interested in Scientology, having known some members. I don't consider it a religion (far from it), and this video does illustrate that it's better-described as a business -- even a brutal business, given the treatment of some members. If you've read any books about Scientology and have followed reports about it in the press, you aren't likely to learn anything new by watching this, but it was interesting enough that I did stick with it all the way to the end. No big complaints; just not enthusiastic about the informational or entertainment aspects of the video."
An average season if survivor. After seasons with all returning players it's hard to watch newbies thinking they have slick tricks.
"""Brake"" is another in a recent string of claustrophobic thrillers set entirely in one small confined space. Instead of the ""buried alive"" aspect, though, the hero of this piece is locked into a transparent box and held in the trunk of a vehicle. And as he tries to figure out just what is going on, it seems that the outside world is alive with terror plots and conspiracies. Just why is this guy locked up? Who is doing it? And what do they need from him? These are the questions that Stephen Dorff wrestles with as he remains the sole character on screen for the entire length of the movie. When the audience is trapped with the film's protagonist in a stagnant space, there is a tendency (if not done correctly) for the picture to get monotonous. ""Brake"" does a serviceable job of keeping things interesting, but mostly because it adds dangers that are patently ridiculous.Slight Spoilers:I mean really, who would believe that ANYONE would be carrying around a load of bees?And the box has the capacity to fill with liquid in the trunk of a car? Where's it coming from?End of Slight SpoilersReally, though, I didn't expect too much from ""Brake."" I just wanted to be entertained. The movie starts with an intriguing premise so I overlooked many of the wild plot developments because I was genuinely interested to see where this journey would take me. While not exactly riveting throughout, it made for a perfectly passable popcorn movie. Dorff seems to be taking on more and more of these direct-to-DVD type roles (although this had a small release, it feels direct-to-DVD) and I'm not sure why. He's actually quite good here as he becomes increasingly unhinged. And he is the absolute center of the piece. Although the movie boasts names such as Tom Berenger and Chyler Leigh, they get but a moment of screen time. No, this is Dorff talking on a CB radio followed by Dorff talking on a cell phone followed by Dorff talking through a tube. I think you get the idea, it's all Dorff!The principle storyline revolves around a political conspiracy and, never for a minute, did I believe any of it. Still, I'd have rated this 3 (possibly 3 1/2) stars if not for the ending. You think the rest of the movie is silly? Just wait for the twists (there are more than one, that's all I say). Any goodwill I had toward ""Brake"" flew out the window with these nonsensical revelations. They turn this mildly engaging movie into one of the most frustrating experiences I've had in a while. None of these last minute twists can withstand even the slightest intellectual scrutiny and the definitely put the brakes on my enjoyment of the movie! KGHarris, 7/12."
"All the other actors appear in the last few minutes of the movie. I guess if you are a Stephen Dorff fan and enjoy looking up his nostrils for over an hour then this is the movie for you. Tom Berenger is the size of a whale and can't find a tie long enough to reach to his belt. A copy of ""Buried"" and less interesting. An IFC Film so look for it on Netflix in the next 3 months or so."
"Bopper and Mark were the only redeeming characters from this season. I couldn't stand how two of the couples treated each other all season long, and don't even get me started on the whiny B**** Rachel. Just plain pathetic, I don't even know how she won Big Brother, but I'm sure I only need 2 guesses."
"I think it is wrong to say it was good for a woman to have a car accident and almost die, and that is a for instance.  Overcoming adversity does not achieve a greater happiness.  It achieves survival, which provides opportunity for more happiness.  The happiness of a child is probably the greatest example of happiness.  They feel safe, they feel loved, they know they have their needs taken care of.  Look at the child who does not have those things - the child who may be fostered and feel out of place.  The child who is abandoned.  Those will never be good things in life.  There are many layers to happiness.  Some come from within and some come from being stimulated - by others who love you and by those whom you like and trust.  Happiness is finding a stability you can count on in life.  That stability may have to be one you are forced to create for survival; it may be a greater good of which you hope to find eventual fulfillment if things work out the way you hope. And while you are waiting for that, riding the wave is not such a bad state of mind.  As in this movie, the father devotes much time doing that literally.  It is no one's business to decide how happy you are with their own happy-meter.  If they want to be your friend, they will care, listen, and certainly not talk behind your back.  If that kind of relationship is achieved, that can bring times of happiness.  Though ultimately, happiness is a decision, we don't have to decide it all the time or have it as a goal.  It comes and sometimes it goes for a while and we need to ride the wave."
"When they killed Mitchell (Aidan Turner) I was sure he would be coming back, resurrected. Then they killed George, Russell Tovey, and Nina as well. What is WRONG with these Brits? They pull this s*** with Doctor Who every few years. Have a popular doctor or companion, who (probably) want more money, and kill them off or replace them. Like all the money has to go to the production company. No fair share to the actors. Replace them. Turner might have wanted out, but that is why you sign them to contracts, so they can't leave just because it's convenient.What is wrong with these Brits!!I thought I had 2 more seasons to watch. Bad enough they call it a series instead of a miniseries. But just acting like the actors mean nothing, is very annoying!"
"This is the end of an amazing team.  A show that started so strong, looses two of it's stellar team in the last season and in this one George leaves rather early.  So to fly the ship we have only Annie played by Lenora Crichlow.  She and the Mitchell replacement guy are the only ones who have a sense of the world it seems.  The new Werewolf guy plays heavy on the pauper to twin the vampire who is a prince.  Personally I wish that they just said something like Daisy had a magic ring that she used to control Mitchell and George and that's how she got Mitchell to kill the people on the buss and for George to bang her.  I never got why George did that.  He was never really a ""tool"".Anyway here we are in the middle of WW ""V"".  For some reason no humans want to become werewolves even though it would improve their odds greatly.  Only some people are aware of the the fact that Vampires have led the war.  Also Nina and George's child is the anti vampire Jesus but no one can find her even though she lives in the middle of England.  I like the new vampire but that's it.  Other new characters aside from the sweet but dumb werewolf include the ghost of an evil young Tim Gunn from ""Project Runway"",  A child rapist Mary Poppins accompanied by the vampire boy from before but they chose to make him dumb now.  There is a retro ghost girl who looks just like Kenley aldo from ""Project Runway""  but unlike Kenley she hates all things retro except her and Annie points this out after this ghost insulted her tea.  Also there is a goth girl who is also dumb (This season love people acting stupid for some reason) who is made into a vampire by a sleazy ugly vampire and the go off to bang somewhere.  I made it up to episode 6 and just could no take it any more."
"This is a long winded narration of the history of the monarchy.  although it provides alot factual information, there is little visual information to clue you in as to why the homes or areas being discussed are important.  If you're a history buff, this will be boring.  If you want to learn, you may wind up fast forwarding thru some of it."
"This Australian film moves from interesting (a lone hunter out to bag the last Tasmanian tiger) to so unsatisfying that a person might wish he'd spent his time more productively, like washing the car.Martin David (Willem Dafoe), an unhappy, taciturn loner, is hired by a mysterious corporation to go to Tasmania and take tissue and blood samples from the one remaining Tasmanian tiger. He'll have to kill it first, of course. When he arrives he finds unfriendly men, a perhaps too helpful but cautious Jack Mindy (Sam Neill) and a conflict between those who want to log ancient trees for jobs and those who want to save the forests. His base is a broken down and eccentrically decorated wooden house with a mother passed out from drugs and drink and her two kids, one a precocious pre-teen and the other a young boy who doesn't speak, only draws. They are cutely named Sass and Bike. The husband has been missing in the forests for a month or two.Martin David prowls through the Tasmanian forests seeking evidence of where the Tasmanian devil lurks. He sets steel traps (illegal), gazes at the beautiful scenery, looks more and more conflicted, and eventually realizes that the corporation has more than one hunter after the animal.And then the movie goes flat, manipulative and becomes deeply unsatisfying. There are good tree huggers victimized by rowdy loggers (there's a message for us), predictable betrayal, the utterly unnecessary deaths of two sympathetic characters, and a conclusion that is sticky with sentiment on the one hand and unethical on the other. If we have to destroy a village to save it, Martin David, with a new, mystical appreciation of nature, is the man to hire. Dafoe, however, gives an engrossing performance."
"Interesting to read previous reviews.  I can't say I agree with any of them.  I like Defoe as an actor, but an actor needs something to work with.  If you have a couple of hours to waste, or need something to put you to sleep, this will probably work."
"Thylacinus cynocephalus aka Tasmanian tiger went extinct in Aussie land, Tasmania and NZ in the early 1900s and despite rewards of millions up until quite recently, there have been only a few unconfirmed sightings.This movie is taken from a novel by the same name. Unfortunately, the characterizations seemed like someone decided to toss a bunch of popular stereotypes into a bag, give it a good toss, and see what story comes out of it.The stereotypic loner assassin with high tech sniper rifle is hired by the usual big bucks pharmaceutical company to kill off the last Thylacinus but not before getting blood and tissue samples so said company can be the sole maker of a resulting super drug. Not believable.Stereotype of ""greenies"" protecting old growth forests against the loggers. Pointless subplot.Stereotype of townspeople in bar showing in your face distrust of a foreigner, in this case the assassin. Not believable.One of the townspeople happens, coincidentally, to have a similar sniper rifle and tries to kill the assassin. Also not believable.Assassin lodges in the home of a researcher, who has gone missing for months. Home is occupied by a depressed wife who can't get out of bed for months while her two very young children take care of everything. Not believable and another plot digression.Sam Neill plays a part time guide along with other roles in the movie that just seemed contrived. Pointless subplot.No flow to the storyline, just a bunch of cutout stereotypes. The only acting worth noting was by Morgana Davies whose naturalness made her character believable. Similar to her performance in ""The Tree"". So far she's hasn't been influenced by the ""Rubber Stamp Acting School"" or become a perennial stuck-in-a-rut actor."
"I hate to give a bad review but this movie really begs for one.No plot whatsoever,I kept waiting for a story line to pop up and all I could do was scratch my head.I enjoy watching Dafoe but I wish he had passed up this role!"
"William Dafoe is a great actor and is the only reason why this movie got 2 stars and not 1 star.  The plot was flawed, unrealistic and the overall story did not make any sense.I am upset that I wasted almost 2 hours of my time and $9.99 to see this horrible movie before it was in theaters.  I hope the movie studios learn from the poor rental results and do not waste their money promoting this film."
"This kind of movie the tv channel use to complete your schedule, boring,no action like in the trailer.Not interesting, need more action and less talk, 40 min is good, 1h is bad, 1:40h i can't saw this, sorry."
"W. Dafoe is surrounded by a bunch of no good antisocial idiots up in the mountains. Not sure why everybody hates him. He is coming to hunt something. Not sure what and why.He arrives in a house with kids where the mom is depressed because her husband has disappeared. He quickly connects with the kids. Not sure what is he doing there and what is the point. Sam Neil's role is still not clear to me. Towards the middle of the movie we know what is he doing up there. Doesn't make any sense scientifically. Not sure how the genetic material will help and for what disease. The whole thing is weird and disconnected.The ending is surprising, not predictable but totally stupid. I still didn't get the message...if there is any!Very poorly done. Expected better from the cast. Two stars just for the acting."
"ATM follows three co-workers as they make a late-night stop at an isolated ATM; as they are leaving, they notice a strange person watching and stalking them. The concept is great, and could've kept people from using ATMs at night, but fails to effectively use it.The bulk of the film takes place in a walk-in-ATM (think: a very large phone booth) in a parking lot. A chain of unfortunate and illogical events take place that leads them there; for example, they need cash because Corey (Josh Peck) must eat at night and the place he must eat at only accepts cash. That's slightly understandable, right? Oh, but David (Brian Geraghty) has to park as far away as possible, then everyone has to get out of the car because Corey's debit card is not working and Emily (Alice Eve) doesn't want to wait in the car. Then, all of the phones are dead or misplaced. Unfortunate for this group, but very fortunate for the psycho outside. Other events like these are scattered across the movie, like a security guard with very bad hearing. Honestly, they could've rushed the man that was clearly unarmed at the beginning or split up when he disappeared for several minutes at a time. As you can see, the movie is poorly and lazily written. I did like the concept a lot, and the feeling of helplessness was evident. The acting was decent, and the music was great. It also has a very fast pace, and has a runtime of 1hr and 20min without the credits, so it's a perfect time-killer if you can get past the illogical events. The ending was also decent.Overall, ATM has an amazing and chilling concept, but it's ultimately poorly executed. It has many flaws, but can kill time if you're bored and want a couple of thrills. As of 10/13/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, and you should stream or rent before purchasing.ATM has strong blood and violence, no sex or nudity."
"After a company christmas party on a cold winter night (guess a Christmas party in summer would be kinda tacky wouldn't it) we have three friends who decide to stop at an ATM. The simpliest of things often turn into a nightmare (or at least they do in this film) and as all of them go to leave some guy in a big winter coat with a massive hood is standing outside looking at them. Unable to figure out what he wants initially it becomes obvious this guy wants something from them and that seems to be to watch them suffer as he does things to get inside and kill them.Its a simple premise and a bit like Colin Farrell's ""Phone Booth"" in that for most of the film its centralized to just the ATM location with the three panicking friends and the killer on the outside. The cast is also pretty typical as the three friends are played by (Alice Eve ""She's Out of My League"", Brian Geragthy ""Jarhead"" and Josh Peck TV's ""Drake & Josh"") as is the killer who really does nothing more than stand outside looking menacing and well of course kills.There are plenty of problems with this movie, namely one being the viewer constantly thinking ""Just run to the car, you can take him"" especially in the early going when the guy goes around the back of the building. It becomes clear what the motives are behind this game the guy is playing with the three people none of which is terribly shocking I guess. Its hard to do a movie from one location and while I give director David Brooks (in his feature debut) props for trying something different there really isn't enough tension to keep the movie going for a full length running time. *1/2 out of 4 stars."
"The set up of a horror or thriller, such as ATM, is probably one of the most important parts of the film. You can expect a chase, gore scenes, some monstrosity's, and if time permits, character development. So here we have two seemingly successful people working in finance who leave a party to bring home a good looking woman, who also works with them. One of the guys needs to stop at an ATM to get money for his late night munchies.The film seems to be set in the city. New York City (or at least something like to NYC). But apparently the only ATM is on this remote street with no one around. Pulling up to the ATM, he parks, what seems like a half a block away. Why not just pull right up to it?? I don't know anyone that does this, especially at 1 in the morning. And so, between the car and the ATM hut stands the killer. And yes, they all forgot their cell phones in the car.I just get infuriated how people find themselves in situations like this. It could be argued on the other side that what are the chances of some crazy guy looking to kill some people locked in an ATM hut. But err on the safe side when the chances are higher that strange people creep around at night in big cities. Ultimately, however, it just seems too convenient for the killer to get into place.The film does not offer much other than high tension. As the other reviewers mentioned, the question of ""why"" is never answered. Clearly it is not supposed to. I am not sure if thats the question the film is offering either. I think its more stating that ""it can be done"". If we recall the opening credit sequence, we see maps and diagrams and coordinates. All of this for the killer as a challenge for technology.I am probably being more poetic than the film deserves, but its a measure of avoidance as the film has little substance to work with. Anything revealed gives away almost too much. I can only assume that the film was green lit based on a pitch and wasn't developed further.Now that I have my gripes out of the way, I will say that the film is well done and the drama is exciting and intense. The acting is credible and well executed, so that's a bonus. It is worth a rental, but not at the current price. I would wait for the actual DVD release. It was exciting and entertaining, but the lack of the depth the film has, I cannot merit it more than 2 stars."
"ATM (David Brooks, 2012)ATM, the first feature from director David Brooks, is a run-of-the-mill thriller. Really, that's it's major problem, and the reason it seems to have attracted so much vitriol. Sure, people are complaining about the script's plot holes, but come on, The Island made, what, eight hundred billion dollars or something? And it had plot holes large enough to swallow this entire script. And, yeah, the characters make some stupid moves, but again, this is a horror film. Horror films without characters who make stupid moves? They're not horror films, they're something else. (I'm not sure what, because in forty years of watching them, I can't recall ever seeing one.) All the other complaints I've seen about the film are strengths, not weaknesses. But I'm getting ahead of myself (and would have to dive deep into spoiler territory anyway, so I'll probably conveniently ignore them).Plot: three co-workers, David (The Hurt Locker's Brian Geraghty), his best friend Corey (Josh Peck, the longtime voice of Eddie from the Ice Age animated franchise), and possible future love interest Emily (The Raven's Alice Eve), are headed home late from their company Christmas party. (Goof note: early in the film, Corey refers to the fact that it's three days before Christmas. Every time you see the security camera footage from the ATM, the footage is dated December 17th. Is Christmas on a different day in Manitoba?) Corey is both hungry and broke, so he asks David, who's driving, to stop at an ATM. Through a series of misadventures like those you're used to seeing in both horror movies and stupid teen sex comedies, all three of them end up in the ATM vestibule. (Unfortunately, this is where the teen sex comedy similarity ends.) When they go to leave the vestibule, standing between them and their car is a masked man wearing an anorak (the anorak becomes important). They figure he's just waiting in line to use the machine until a random guy walking his dog wanders into the parking lot, and is quickly, and brutally, dispatched. The movie then becomes a waiting game, with the three players inside trapped and trading recriminations, while the anonymous killer just stands there, watching, and occasionally disappears in order to make amusing thumping noises to scare the victims.I'm willing to write off a lot in horror movies (for example, what most people are thinking is the Big Twist part of the Big Twist Ending is a simple misunderstanding that will be cleared up by all the principal parties five minutes after the camera stops rolling) without taking points off; that's just part of being a fan of the genre. And like I said before, it comes with the territory that you're dealing with stupid people making stupid decisions. The problems arise when the script fails in its continuity--for example, have one character being so close to cold-related death as to be delirious halfway through the film, and then, five minutes later and with no added heat source, having that character be the most lucid in the vestibule (for the rest of the film). Annoyances like this, when it comes to movies like this, are absolutely legitimate, and should be criticized. But it's not an awful movie, even if it is yet another entry in an oversaturated genre. If you can dismiss the silly continuity errors (and get past the fact that while Brian Geraghty is a solid character actor, he may not be quite ready for leads yet), it's good enough late-night Netflix viewing if nothing else looks appealing. **"
"David (Brian Geraghty) is a shy stock investor. Co-worker Emily (Alice Eve) is perhaps equally shy. On her last day of work, David works up the courage to ask her out. She agrees and also agrees to let David drive her home. The problem is there is a third wheel, mutual co-worker Corey (Josh Peck) who needs a ride and is hungry. They agree to grab a bite at a unique all night place that only accepts cash. They must first visit a remote ATM. Time and temperature are flashed for us to set the tone: 1:18 AM, -3F. The three are in the ATM.Outside the ATM, is a man assuming the ""Jason pose."" He brutally murders another man in the parking lot. The trio is afraid to venture out and I am thinking...did they just remake an ATM version of ""Frozen""?For some undisclosed reason the killer doesn't try to enter the ATM. You will find out more, or less at the ending.If you liked ""Frozen"" or ""Altitude"" (and I didn't) you might try ATM.1 f-bomb, no sex or nudity."
"The premise of ""ATM"" - three people trapped in an ATM vestibule - is created by Chris Sparling, writer of another confined-space thriller ""Buried"" starring Ryan Reynolds. In ""ATM,"" while withdrawing money from an ATM on the way home from a Christmas party, two young men and woman David (Brian Geraghty), Corey (Josh Peck) and Emily (Alice Eve) are trapped in an ATM booth by a hooded stranger, whose intent is not friendly.Though the story itself is not implausible, the way it unfolds feels so contrived and unrealistic that most viewers would stop caring what is going on. Without revealing too much of the film, I can say that 30 minutes into the film things start getting silly. The more elaborate the story gets, the less thrilling the film becomes, making us think about simpler solutions for the three characters.With convincing psychological interactions between the characters (including the stranger standing outside), ""ATM"" would have been much more entertaining. As it is, ""ATM"" is a typical case of a nice concept ruined by poor execution."
"kristin chenoweth does not look to be the same age as the star that she was supposed to go to highschool with. i got as far as the star getting a job at the restaurant called Boobies. I am not making up the name! this show was stupid and did not make me laugh. I got it because i saw Kristin Chenoweth in some movie and she was really funny.  not this tv show,that's for sure! 2 thumbs the eff down!"
"I really didn't see it as attacking Christianity. It was supposed to be a commentary on how self-righteous the bible-belt frequently tends to get. And I think this is what had viewers (particularly in the region) up in arms. Hell hath no fury like somebody whose flaws are uncovered for all the world to see and critique.All of this said, I myself personally did not find the show appealing.First, it replaced my favorite series Pan Am. Strike One. So I was already naturally bound to come in with a bit of skepticism--even when it says there is satire of my 'home region'.  They should have moved the series for a different night and/or time. And just kept the good show on.Go with what already works. Give yourselves time to workout problems with the new show and build up a 'new' audience.Strike two. These women acted like my stepmother! The big hair, holier than thou blond-bimbo-bombshell diva routine, just was not personally funny in any television script. The series main character is starting over after herself having been a you-know-what. So there was potentially room here to successfully build in audience. Most people like to see underdogs succeed against tremendous odds.But she still contends with 'the attitude' from her peer group. I already get enough of this off camera. And television is supposed to be a relaxing escape from real life. It's not supposed to ailenate the viewing audience ourself from--yes, boredom. People aren't going to watch a 'sitcom' rehashing reality. The odds which she was supposed to come up against were the wrong ones to successfully hold audience interest for a weekly sitcom-drama.It just wasn't 'fun' viewing. Sorry ABC."
"It was already not the best show on TV, but at least with the original cast as the original characters the show could be good, clean fun.  After most of the cast left, and the producers tried in vain to replace them with equally compelling players, the show clearly went downhill."
The show is too scripted. A reality show is SUPPOSED to be off the &#34;cuff&#34; and spontaneous. This show is too scripted. And why is Roy Williams (one of the dirtiest football players that ever played) on the show? He's an absolute idiot!Talk about scripted...when was the last time YOU were able to walk right up to a famous athletes house and ring his door bell?What a crock.
"There are a lot of reality shows that I enjoy. But not this one. This one is just not entertaining. I Watched the 1st two episodes and turned it off in the middle of the 2nd one.It's scripted and stupid.i.e. - They really want you to believe that the one brother (on his own) flooded out their loading dock so that ducks would come and they can test out their duck calls!!! Really!!!Even though the opening of the show, shows them at a local lake hunting ducks...with their duck calls.If they want to test their calls, why not just go to the lake? Instead they flood their loading dock, with a hose. That had to take a couple of days easily.Dumb show."
"I just don't get the appeal of this series.  I watched some of it because of the hype, and as far as I'm concerned it was like watching paint dry.  I might have found it more interesting if it had been realistic: i.e., if there was a depiction of this well-educated but 'country' family who became wealthy though hard work and establishing their niche.  All the camo and ammo panders to those who want to see southern religious families as eccentric idiots.  These people are, clearly, good businessmen/women and the series left me...literally."
"I only watched the beginning of it and then realized it wasn't something that would appeal to me, so I stopped."
"I know this is one of the hottest shows in cable but I dont understand what all the hoopla is about, guess you just have to be a readneck?"
"This is probably the most scripted &#34;reality&#34; show I've watched on the net.  The &#34;good ol' back woods swamp boys&#34; are about as authentic as a woman who has had implants and other plastic surgery, and has enrolled in a natural beauty contest."
I only looked at this program to find out what all the hype was about.  This program is not for me personally.  It's good to have choices of what you can look at; but this program will never be tuned in on my television again.  Different strokes for different folks.
Didn't care for it - just too stupid for me. Maybe if I watched more of it but so far it wasn't worth my time.
"Admittedly we're only 6 episodes in but sadly there's been a big drop in comedic quality since season 15. Something has gone sadly wrong this year where the normally sharp satire has been replaced with parodies of TV shopping networks, other TV shows and 'specials' that don't make any sense in the South Park universe (Cartman becoming Jewish?).I've been a huge fan of South Park for years, often wondering how they manage to maintain quality for such a long running show. But unless things improve soon, it looks like season 16 may be South Park's ""Simpsons moment"", marking the turning point where the show loses its edge. Are the best days still to come for Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman? Please prove me wrong."
"THE MOTH DIARIES looks nice, creating Gothic atmosphere in a modern setting.  Ultimately, though, it's a hollow and uninspired film.  Is Ernessa a true vampire or does Rebecca create her fears to eradicate herself over guilt she feels from her father's tragic death?  The movie's failure to support either scenario results in an uneven film resulting in a disappointing conclusion.The cast does well, but the romantic subplot with Rebecca and the handsome professor has no real impact on the film.  MOTH DIARIES is another example of style over substance."
"What can I say? I like things from the I.D. channel but (honestly) -- even with the disclaimer -- this was far too raw for me.After 3 episodes, I must call it quits.Why?Because while I understand that the world can be a wicked place, I don't always want to know just how wicked/evil it is.Because sometimes (and for some people) the suffering of the innocent can haunt you...Because most times (if not always) there is simply NOTHING redemptive (or entertaining) about sexual sadists and the pleasure they gain from subjecting others to their sick and defiled mental and/or physical wanderings...This program (while informative) could not silence the voice inside my head that kept reminding me that it was not ""good"" for me. Nor could it help me not to think about the victims and their families.In addition (particularly in this first episode) it could not quiet the distress I felt in knowing that there are parents who, by their depraved actions, create a heart of depravity in their own children. (For longer than I care to remember, I will be reminded of what her father told her and did to her on the evening of her mother's death... Having suffered another horrendous end, only by the grace of God would it be possible for her to end up being someone other than who and what she became. When it's clear that the perpetrator is also the victim? Nothing entertaining about it. Only fills my heart with sorrow which I really don't need...)Finally it became too much for me to know that there are women who would be, could be, complicit in such acts. (Episode 3 - allowing your husband to rape his own child and you being a part of it -- what more can be said...)Don't get me wrong. I love forensic type programs but...This program is about the utter destruction that 2 depraved hearts (joined together) can bring about against the innocent for nothing other than their own pleasure. In it the worst of what can be found in a man and a woman is lived out. It's about fantasy's becoming real, hearts becoming hard, and consciences becoming seared.All in all, the ""realness"" of it all is too much for me.Just too much..."
"I've watched a few of these so far. Not sure I'll watch the rest. They're not bad, just uneven. The show on lightening was informative, but the blizzard episode was just lame. It should be titled &#34;Don't you people check the radar?&#34; The show covered people caught in blizzards. One guy decided to get away for a while in the Pacific Northwest, so he hops in the car and starts driving without adequate supplies or adequate clothing. Oh, and without checking the radar. So, he drives straight into the teeth of a HUGE blizzard and gets stuck. For 2 weeks. The moral of that story is to know what you're driving into and prepare for it before you leave the house. With all the mobile technology we have at our disposal these days..."
Low grade film not very interesting to watch. Story does not build up. Other shows like 48 hours has better interviews.
Don't like real cop or drama shows. If you do you would like this because it shows how the cops handle a homiside.
"What would you do on the eve of the planet's destruction? That is the question posited by Abel Ferrara's ""4:44 Last Day On Earth."" The answer, it would seem, is to live it much like any other. I'm a fan of Ferrara as a filmmaker, I find him refreshingly unpredictable. I'm not sure, however, that ""4:44 Last Day On Earth"" conveyed and/or made the most of its intriguing premise. While I appreciate that not every apocalyptic endeavor has to be big, bold, and melodramatic--at times this felt so underplayed as to be virtually non-existent. While the concept and images advertising the movie may make it seem like a thriller (the word suspenseful is used in the description), this is a slow burn contemplation in which not much happens. Luckily, Ferrera had the wherewithal to cast Willem Dafoe as his central protagonist. Dafoe, as usual, makes for interesting viewing. This seems like an incredibly personal work for Ferrera and the intimacy that Dafoe brings to his performance is never less than fascinating.The inconvenient truth of the situation is that Al Gore and his contemporaries were correct about their dire environmental predictions. Catastrophe, however, is way ahead of schedule and the end of the world has been pinpointed with precision. How? Don't ask. Despite the fact that it is supposedly the last day on earth (not everyone believes it, even though news broadcasts have ended due to the imminent game changer), nothing seems too drastically different in Dafoe's neighborhood. Traffic and pedestrians seem normal, stores and bars are open, you can order Chinese food. There is never a real sense of doom. Most of the movie is spent in one apartment with Dafoe and his girlfriend (Shanyn Leigh) dancing, using Skype, painting, making love, or just hanging out independently. Ferrera's point, perhaps, is that life goes on even if there isn't much of it left. While an interesting notion from an intellectual perspective, it doesn't necessarily make riveting entertainment.I do give ""4:44 Last Day On Earth"" a marginal recommendation (mostly for the performances) for the arthouse crowd, I'm not sure the film will have a universal appeal. At a mere 82 minutes, I kept wishing 4:44 in the morning would arrive sooner. The film has a pleasing grittiness and rawness, and I appreciated the use of actual news footage (constantly playing in the background) to make the apocalypse seem tangible. Once again, don't think this is a thriller! It is a stagnant character piece with minimal dialogue. I'm not sure what I'd do on my last night on earth, I can only hope it would be more interesting than what is presented here. Ferrera's vision is filled with shopping, Chinese take-out, and karaoke. An interesting approach, to be sure, but not as compelling as I hoped. Watched it with a friend, he bailed at the 30 minute mark. KGHarris, 7/12."
"This movie was boring.  There are some movies that brilliantly let the viewer experience violence, without the violence actually being seen, leaving the viewer to reconstruct the scene in his/her mind, and/or consider ambiguous plot details (who is the actual killer?).  Pulp Fiction comes to mind, at least insofar as most violence was just barely removed from the actual screen.  This film tries to recreate that approach, but it falls flat.  There has to be a strong plot connection for the actual violence/implied violence to have an impact, and that connection is lacking here.  In most scenes, we come to realize that someone has been killed, but rather than having a strong emotional impact, its a simply ""so what"" event.  The viewer is never brougth into the antagonist's or protagonist's emotional sphere, so you never really care. You never feel like the protagonist (Luke Wilson) is actually threatened, so everything else has no impact.  Further, Luke Wilson, while decent for low brow, college-level humor, is way out of his league playing this kind of role.  The movie is just flat and dull, not recommended."
"Should be called ""meeting boredom"", ""mistakes on a bane"", ""djang-doh"", ""brown snake moan"", or ""proxy brown"".  Ok I'll stop. I""m saying this movie is poop and the world is less fun from having seen it.  I think it was made so that Luke and Sam could race lamborghinis off a cliff while high-fiving (lukes' from the uk)."
"Sometimes with Samuel L. Jackson you get him playing a hero or a villain and honestly he's good at both. He did a good job playing his character in this one as an evil eyed killer that murdered people ""just because"". His role in the film is one of the movies more redeeming qualities as I don't believe it would have worked so well with a different actor. These ""I met a stranger"" type of movies really require just the right person with the right bits of crazy. The only other movie I think that pulled it off nicely was ""Blood River"" but that's a whole different league.Meeting Evil is the story of a man who's down on his luck with his job,his life, and his marriage. Everything that can go wrong did go wrong for him. He's just a good guy trying to hold on to whatever positive he has left. What is unraveled in this movie is a much deeper personal look into John's problems. The first of which starts as soon as he foolishly tries to lend a helping hand to a stranger that knocks on his door. Samuel Jackson plays ""Richie"" a sadistic killer that's capable of doing anything and everything. John is at first very naive to all of this until he finally buts it all together for himself and finds himself caught in an even deeper mess than he ever imagined.What makes meeting evil good is that it brings up some interesting plot points and what makes it bad is that it never builds on them at all. It just sort of shows you one thing like Johns relationship with his female co-worker and then it never comes back to it. It's sort of just left there when for the first half of the movie you're basically watching the chemistry between the two characters. That's just how ""Meeting Evil"" plays out. Good ideas that never seem to wrap themselves up. The ending to the film is a prime example of that as for the type of movie this is, it's the type where a solid ending is needed but this one likes to leave on an open note.For those reasons I didn't enjoy Meeting Evil much. The majority of the show is watching people being senselessly murders (although it's portrayed very well adding mystery and allure to how Richie works)but the movie never seems to have any uplifting moments or any point to it. It's very dark and leaves you feeling kind of in a hopeless place watching the killer roam free and John dragged into it. There really aren't any heroes in this movie just victims. There's no one to cheer for and Samuel Jackson with make you hate him by the time the final scenes come up. He just completely Evil in this movie and maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it so much. Usually when Samuel Jackson plays a villain he has some trait that makes him likeable but, in this movie he is just sadistically evil.Without spoiling the movie which is easy to do as there are few twists in the shallow story, you really are just watching a movie about a pathetic man whose life turns upside down thanks to not only the killer that bumps into his life but the people that the man trusts as well turn out not to be on his side either.Overall I give the movie about a 2.5 out of 5. I didn't enjoy watching it but, that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. I can see others watching it and enjoy it as it does have it's good points but for me personally it's just not my taste."
"This is one of those rare movies that I knew nothing about going in and frankly not much coming out.  The film opens with a sinister stranger named Richie (a scene chewing Samuel L. Jackson) knocking on the door of suburbanite John Fleton (Luke Wilson), despondent over the loss of his job.  It seems Richie has car trouble as asks John for a push.  One nit to pick is that Richie's GTO appears to have an automatic transmission, so there is no clutch to ""pop.""  I digress.Somehow, Richie gets John to go with him after John's leg is injured.  This might be something expected in some teen horror movie but what kind of idiot is middle aged John?  Now I'm still trying to figure out if this is some dark comedy, a horror film or just a by-the-numbers psycho-thriller.  Richie and John travel the area, with several diversions by Richie that result in numerous deaths including at least one kid.  John's wife Joanie (Leslie Bibb) becomes involved after the murders are linked to her morose husband.  One of the police detectives raises the issue of life insurance which of course, throws a possible murder-for-hire scheme into the mix.  Ultimately we don't get many answers in this poorly written disjointed mess."
"Perhaps the fact that ""Meeting Evil"" is written and directed by someone responsible for ""S. Darko,"" a pointless and confusing ""sequel"" to a cult classic ""Donnie Darko,"" would be worth mentioning. Yes, ""Meeting Evil"" is a mess. Well, it's not exactly a total mess, thanks to the star Samuel L. Jackson and his mesmerizing performance, though I would rather be watching him in a superhero franchise or Quentin Tarantino film.Luke Wilson plays John Felton, a down-and-out real estate agent, who is visited by a mysterious guy, Samuel L. Jackson's ""Richie."" Richie seems interested in John, who, dejected and angry, barely controls his emotions. Richie follows John, even when it is obvious John doesn't like it, and wherever Ritchie goes, strange things happen, like people suddenly disappearing.So who is Richie and what is his motive? Without revealing too much about the movie, I would only say that the story doesn't make much sense. The storyline is incoherent and illogical (not in an intriguing way like a David Lynch film), and the subplot about a young woman Tammy (Peyton List) goes nowhere. You notice so many lapses of logic and so much inexplicable decision-making, hoping that they will be explained away before the film ends.But that doesn't happen. (You don't see a big explosion on the DVD jacket, either, if I remember correctly). About 30 minutes in, the film gets boring as we come to realize that the film is nothing but a poorly assorted collection of clich&eacute; ideas."
OK series. Love Cieran Hinds though. He's excellent as usual. Maybe I was just in a strange mood when I watched this.
"I've only watched a couple of episodes, but it's not for me.  The violence and graphic murder scenes just don't define what I consider entertainment.  That being said, I'm sure it will be very popular to many."
"Ouch! Remind me to read the reviews and why it was recommended in the future. Perhaps the idea was to overwhelm the viewer with sensationalism to cover the qualities of the actors. The part of the 'actor' (Allen Daniels) is the most convincing. The plot is reasonable but it seems to lose it's way within the flashes of the past. If one watches part one, part two becomes almost inevitable viewing. Interesting for those who enjoy this genre . . . not recommended for those who are serious students of military history and wander into 'recommended' without questioning why!"
"No! Watched 30 minutes and turned it off. Too edgy, gross, and dragy. Too many other good shows to fall for this one."
"As a longtime Ciaran Hinds fan, as well as one who relishes crime dramas that shed light on the workings of tortured minds (e.g.,Law & Order Criminal Intent), I could overlook the shortcomings of the first two-part episode (Anna's wobbly spike heels, the short skirt, the misty eyed but knowing looks, her thoroughly unprofessional demeanor, etc.), and gave it a rave review based on the strength of the final interrogation scene, dynamite, she showed what she's made of, mettle-wise, matching the perp in intensity.  His crimes made sense, though there were gruesome details galore, they struck me as realistic, not gratuitous or designed merely to shock.  I also liked the promise of the attraction between the two leads, where would it lead?  Then I watched ""seasons"" 2 and 3.Gratuitous, preposterous.  So many gaffes, overlooked leads and details, FOR EXAMPLE, ***SPOILER ALERT*** in Season 3, they did NO background check on the perp's brother (!), and they only thought to check on the whereabouts of the perp's son at the last minute- gosh, he might have gone there!  And no reporting of the knowledge of the plane, no typing in of the plane's serial number to see what/where it might be, absurd.  The final scene wherein Ciaran and Kelly abandon the car and RUN down the runway after the plane was one of the stupidest scenes EVER.  MANY plot points are left totally unexplained.  It's as though through some printing mishap every other page of the script failed to print and nobody noticed.RE: Season 2, if you thrive on the lurid and the depths of human depravity, much the same way horror fans watch zombies eating people's brains with glee, this may be your cup of tea, though I'm sure you'd like a story that makes SENSE as well.  ***BIG TIME SPOILER ALERT*** A father who not only commits the most gruesome of murders, but forces one victim to eat excrement before dismembering her, also sexually tortures his son and daughters, operates on and removes his daughter's reproductive organs, for FUN.  I couldn't overlook such blatant gratuitousness in any case, but there might have been SOME justification if we gained an understanding of such depravity, or the dynamics of the coppers' interpersonal relationships, or what makes the characters tick, but no such luck.  The leads and the other officers evince one-dimensional, erratic behavior that made NO sense.SO many errors, ludicrous; for example, one of the daughters assaults detectives on two separate occasions, drawing blood, and no-one says a word (they don't even fight back, one just slinks away)!  They don't arrest people for assaulting police officers in the UK?  Also, they had the perpetrator's voice on tape (I think, or SHOULD have taped his calls), early on could've matched the voice prints, AS WELL AS eyewitness identification of him, yet they don't arrest him, simply learn more appalling details with each visit then go back to the squad room and look at the horrific crime scene photos again.  When they finally do detain him, they sit him in an easy chair and serve him lunch, and, SURPRISE, he escapes.  And a detective sleeping with a reporter, ""accidentally"" affording him access to her case notes?  And with no repercussions?  COME ON.  Columbo or Inspector Morse this ain't.  Real UK cops must've had a field day with this twaddle.  I admit I was curious to see if things might improve in the final installment, but it's not a Prime offering so that sealed the deal.For lurid and close to the bone that DOES make sense, (to me, anyway), seeSingle Handed: Natural Justice, a VERY dark (and profane, be forewarned), but superb Irish series available on Instant Video.  And BOTH seasons are free to Prime members."
"With so much hype and talent on board, I was hoping for a much better product.  Spectacular Spider-man was great and way too short...I am still watching them every few months.  Ultimate Spider-man has too many different styles, and too much story jammed in this, to makes it any fun.  Shield, highschool, electric webs?  a spider-cycle...c'mon!  The greatest hero in the world swings around NYC not rides a motorcycle!  Some of the fights have been good, but the quiet story parts are uninteresting.  Marvel please look at Young Justice to see how a good cartoon is made or bring back Spectacular Spider-man.  Spidey deserves a good cartoon....please, please, please...."
I found myself waiting for Ang to show up to brighten my day.  The whole beauty and artistry of the original was downgraded in this.  It shows that the producers wanted to make a quick buck by tapping into the children's market.  The original Avatar was actually beautifully put together. This is a piece of crap and destroyed most of my feelings about the original characters.  Save your money
"Reality check here! Nothing is actually solved, no one is identified and there is no 'closure.' Given the same information, what would your 'guess' be? Obviously murder lurks unsolved and foreboding, who committed the crime, where and with what? Ah! Perhaps  it was Mrs. Peacock in the library with a candlestick . . . or could it be Colonel Mustard in the kitchen with a knife? There would appear to be no doubt as to why this series was canceled or is there? Have some funky fun and find your own answer!"
"This series starts well, and for the first episodes promises to be a great Brit mystery / detective / serial killer story. The signs of the disaster are however there from the beginning--overacted, over-analyzed personal issues and relations, too many conflicts for a conflicted smart detective and a bunch of bad bosses. Once the thing starts to go down, it simply becomes painful to watch. The plot regarding the investigation, which is good, gets diluted amid unappealing and impossible to believe piles of personal drama. Mind you, the wife of the good detective starts overnight hating her beloved husband because he cannot solve a series of crimes in which the victims are women. This seem to clearly show her that he is a chauvinist who does not care about her. This silly plot line would have made some mild sense if it were not because the detective character not only seems not to be chauvinist but also is spending nights and weekends trying to solve the case, putting up with insufferable bosses, and ruining his career trying to solve the crimes. But the endless insane scenes of matrimonial fights are terrible and cut any mystery line. The fact that later the detective starts an affair with a female detective that, predictably, does not work and ends up involving more insufferable senseless relationship dialogues does not help. Neither does that every boss who is put in charge of the investigation is both and idiot and a bad police. I mean, of course no one will solve these crimes. The character are too occupied being miserable and boring to watch to get the job done."
"Sebastian Faulks' novel is highly regarded.  I've not read it, but I'll take people's word that it's good.  Abi Morgan is a talented screenwriter whose work I've enjoyed -- most recently, the series ""The Hour"" and the film ""Shame"".  So I should've liked ""Birdsong"".  But for whatever reason, the potential in this project just didn't gel into anything particularly great.  Perhaps the series needed to be longer:  the love story feels rushed; Eddie Redmayne's compatriots in the trenches just seem like quick sketches; and then it's over.  Well, it's not over before we're given the moral of story, delivered by a guy tragically dying in the trenches.  ""It's all we're good for,"" the guy croakingly soothsays to Redmayne, while the strings weep in the background.  ""To love and be loved.""  (Hopefully this scene is not in the novel.)But before we get to that pearl of wisdom, we must endure a lot of staring into the middle distance, mostly from Redmayne as he reminiscences about his lost love while in the trenches.  The director was rather cruel to Redmayne, I should think.  The guy is asked to look tragic throughout the whole picture, even in the pre-war scenes.  He's asked to break down and sob a few times.  Actors hate that, by the way.  Worst of all, he's asked to whisper.  A lot.  Almost his entire dialogue is whispered.  If you don't have a decent home theater system with Dolby, you are well advised to turn on the Closed Captioning, unless you enjoy alternating your volume up and down between whispering and bombshells.  I think some directors confuse whispered dialogue with Important Dialogue.The heart of the thing is the love story, but, as I said earlier, the story is too rushed for us to start really rooting for the lovers to come together.  There is some nice intensity between them as they steal glances at each other and play some footsie on a rowboat (for once, all the staring works to a purpose), but it's just not enough.  The lady is married to an impotent man, conveniently enough, and I think she's supposed to be about 10 or so years older than Redmayne.  But Clemence Poesy appears to be the same age as Redmayne, so it's strange when she calls him ""my boy"", and it's even stranger when the 16-year-old daughter of the husband's first marriage calls Poesy ""maman"".  Poesy seems like a fine actor, but this is a Casting Fail.As for the rest of it:  there's a Gallipoli-like futile charge against the Germans that fails because of incompetent planning by the military brass, but really, haven't we seen all this before?  In fact, we've seen it in ""Gallipoli"", a superior movie directed by Peter Weir.  I couldn't connect with the soldiers' mission, and I couldn't connect with them.  One of them wears sweaters, sent from his mother back in England, over his army issue.  Couldn't tell you anything else about him, though.  Perhaps Abi Morgan needed to spend more time on them.  Perhaps the producers needed a bigger budget to expand the series.Or, and here's a thought, maybe the original novel the series is based on isn't all that good to begin with, contrary to received opinion.  All that I learned from ""Birdsong"" is that War, and French Ladies, are Hell.  Tell me something I don't know!  2 out of 5."
I never thought the war segments would be more interesting than the love story.  Poor acting for the love story and so much dead pauses.
"I just could not get into this show.  The characters were a little bland in my opinion and the story line was moving too slowly.  If I had more time and nothing else to watch, I might have finished the first episode but otherwise, it did not hold my attention"
expected story to be much more real.  male main  actor always seem to be in a daze.  horrible was going on and he 's in dreamland.  I felt like shouting &#34;snap out of it&#34;  didn't enjoy movie at all.
"I didn't really have high hopes for this apparent Paranormal Activity wannabe since I'm not a fan of camcorder-style horror flicks to begin with, but this didn't even live up to my already low expectations.  The first actor you see onscreen when the movie starts is Rick Gonzalez, who was a regular on the television series Reaper.  I've never seen one of these movies with a recognizable actor before because that ruins the illusion that what you are seeing is real, which is the main point of the camcorder-style format.  But Apartment 143 turns out to be more like a bad episode of Sea of Souls than a Paranormal Activity knock-off, and the camcorder format is basically a misguided and unnecessary gimmick.  The basic premise of the movie is that a team of researchers sets up shop inside an apartment where a family (father, teen-age daughter, young son) are experiencing what appears to be a haunting.  There are phone calls with nobody there and ringing doorbells with nobody at the door and strange noises but even in real life this stuff would be more annoying than scary.  Nothing remotely scary happens in the movie until nearly an hour in.  The biggest problem with Apartment 143, though, is that it has a very lousy script.  The researchers are supposed to be experts in paranormal activity but the idea that a poltergeist might be the issue isn't brought up until nearly two thirds of the way into the movie--but given the presence of an angry teenage daughter in the home that should have been one of the first things that occurred to all three researchers.  Then in an amazingly laughable scene the head researcher suggests that the teen daughter might be suffering from the onset of schizophrenia--because nothing says schizophrenia like furniture flying of it's own accord across the room and characters levitating Exorcist style on their own.  Ugh.  There are a couple of decent shocks involving the daughter but otherwise this movie is a talky and poorly written bore.  I would recommend pretty much any episode of the UK horror series Sea of Souls (which has the same set-up of a trio of researchers investigating possible paranormal activity) strongly over this film."
"The film has some effective moments of tension. However, the filmmakers attempt a backstory explaining the source of the paranormal activity is weak, which is the main failing of the film."
"At the risk of tooting my own horn, I'm comfortable admitting that I'm far more forgiving of these ""found footage"" films than most reviewers.  I've no problem saying that I've enjoyed the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY franchise, even find them modestly creative in their own way.  Also, that APOLLO 18 flick wasn't all that much a failure, certainly not so much as the critics would have you believe.  And, yeah, even THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT had some solid inspiration behind its formula to recreate an episode of `The Twilight Zone' on a very low budget.  And as much as I wanted to give AREA_407 kudos for bringing that unique `found footage' perspective into monster and/or science fiction, I really wish someone would've showed these filmmakers how to use a tripod or a track mount for much of it.See, AREA_407 - for all its strengths - I found very difficult to watch.  The camera's constant bobbing and weaving and shaking and climbing and arcing and dropping became nauseating by the second half.  At 90 minutes, that's a bit too long for the average viewer to stomach without a healthy dose of Dramamine to tide him over.  The chief problem - unlike some of the other forays into `found footage' - is that quite a bit of AREA_407 takes place at night, in very confined settings, and under the tightly focused spotlight beam on a video camera.  You don't have anything to look away at, to momentarily refocus your field of vision, and, as a result, you're forced to concentrate on a screen too intently for too long a time.After boarding a plane on New Year's Eve, two sisters begin videotaping their encounters with fellow passengers.  It doesn't take long for the audience to realize that this plane is going down.  Once on the ground (and for reasons that really defy storytelling logic), the girls continue videotaping their continuing attempts to frustrate those bruised and bloodied around them by capturing it all on videotape.  And, once it becomes clear that they're being hunted one-by-one for what would appear to be dinner by some monster, they still maintain the presence of mind to keep videotaping it all, each and every painful second.  Now, I realize some could make the argument that the girls didn't know the video camera was on - that maybe they were only using it for the light - but the problem that they keep admitting to videotaping EVERYTHING debunks that argument.And that's what's a shame about AREA_407: I really WANTED to love it.  Not only does it have everything a good `found footage' flick should have, it's also composed of equal parts LOST (the TV show) and JURASSIC PARK and CLOVERFIELD.  These folks are trapped - in the dark - and there's a monster out there.  No, they don't quite know what it is, but they see it in fleeting shots of light, and, thus, they can confirm that it's big, it's scary, and it's hungry.  And it isn't going away!  It's an edge-of-your-seat thrill much of the time ... but, creatively, it should've gone the way of `found footage' films like DISTRICT 9 did.  They should've used `found footage' for only the parts of the film that needed it; then, when it became a traditional monster movie, they should've laid the handi-cam aside and used traditional film equipment.  They still could've preserved the `shock' ending by going back to `found footage,' and, in my estimation, they would've had a modest hit on their hands.  All of the right ingredients were here ... they just had them in incorrect amounts.AREA_407 was produced by Suzanne DeLaurentiis Productions and Cloud Nine Pictures.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group.  How does it look?  Well, I think I've covered that in pretty great detail, no?  How does it sound?  For the most part, I had no problem with the audio.  Sure, given the nature of the method the filmmakers decided to tell their story, there's some predictable and deliberate problems with it.  Sadly, there are no special features to speak of on the disc.  Shame on you, filmmakers.  Shame on you.RECOMMENDED with modest reservations.  I'm giving it a solid two-and-one-half stars based on the finished product, but I do so not without warning.  As I've tried to make abundantly clear, this is one of them there ""found footage"" variety flicks.  If you're not into the herky-jerky camerawork, then AREA_407 is probably not for you because the herky and the jerky are front and center throughout all of it.  Still, there's a great story here - with some truly great scares - all given respectable life through the magic of film.  When someone remakes this, let's hope they get it right.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the good folks at MPI Media Group provided me with a DVD screener copy of AREA_407 by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
"Area 407 is a found-footage horror film. A plane crashes in a mysterious area; the survivors are then stalked and attacked by a mysterious predator. The whole situation is documented by two sisters and a fellow journalists (two cameras). I enjoyed the intro and felt it was done well. We meet the characters through some decent dialogue and witness a frightening plane crash (at least for those of us scared to fly). Sadly, the movie goes downhill from here. It uses some very generic found-footage scenes like the shouting exchange found in most: ""Please stop recording! Now is not the time! STOP!"" (then hit the camera and cut out, recording restarts in a new scene). Also, I felt a lot of it was illogical, more than your average horror film. They take an hour to get the first-aid kit after the crash, the U.S. Air Marshall doesn't identify herself for hours after the crash, and the flight attendant and the Air Marshall don't really know what they're doing (aren't there emergency procedures for this instead of sitting around?) For a horror movie, I wasn't really scared, maybe once or twice. It had some tense moments, though. Acting ranged from good to bad. The ending was also decent, but not enough to complete redeem the film completely. It's a time-killer, though.Overall, it's not the worst found-footage film, but it's far from the best. If you're still interested, this film is available on Netflix Streaming as of 9/2/12, I can't recommend paying directly for this film.Area 407 has strong violence and blood (most of the violence is off-screen), no sex or nudity."
"Utilizing the increasingly popular ""found footage"" genre that combines elements of the thriller into a faux documentary presentation, ""Area 407"" is never particularly effective at establishing its intentions. It's hard to discuss the flaws of the film without revealing too much, so I'll be purposefully vague. The movie charts a plane crash and its immediate aftermath in a desert region of the United States. The survivors of the crash face two imminent dangers (which I won't discuss) but the two threads don't really work well together. As the DVD cover positions the film as a monster movie, I'll say that particular element is handled reasonably well. You get occasional glimpses of the terror, but nothing of a full reveal until the very end. The more human side to the threat is a LOT more vague, unexplained, and frankly lacking in logic. I didn't necessarily hate ""Area 407,"" it just offers little new to this overused film technique. You've seen similar movies and you've seen them better.The movie begins on New Year's Eve as a cross country flight from New York to Los Angles is about to embark. Two young sisters are among the passengers and the youngest is filming everyone in the most irritating way possible. Not to be unkind or personal, but the voice is like nails on a chalkboard. Seriously, I'd have rammed a pencil in my ear if I had been seated next to her. But of course, she is super precious and charming to everyone else and they proceed to treat her like a two year old for the remainder of the picture. The plane crash itself is decent, and I loved the way everyone's head was splattered with massive amounts of bright red blood afterwards. A small band of survivors now must face the ultimate challenge to their survival. Who will make it through the night? What is stalking them? And can anyone help? The movie plays just as you would expect with people dropping like flies.I had two major issues with ""Area 407."" First, the logic of the ""found footage"" style is never adhered to very well. In one scene, for example, a menacing noise is heard in the woods. The young lady holding the camera never swings around toward the source of the noise like you would in real life, she keeps the shot firmly on the flight attendant's reaction. In a normal chain of events, they'd have been using the light to try to see what was making the noise and the attendant would have screamed ""get that camera out of my face, you bozo, don't you hear that screaming!"" But even more distracting, the film seems to lack a real screenplay (although FIVE people share a story credit for this thin tale). The cast (a couple of which are quite good) seem to be making dialogue up as the movie zips along. Needless to say, quite a few awkward and ridiculous phrases and exclamations are uttered before the night is through. All in all, the entire endeavor feels slight, familiar, and relatively amateurish. My simple wish is never to see another ""found footage"" thriller until someone has something new to offer. ""Area 407"" is not that movie. KGHarris, 8/12"
"The video streaming quality remained at ""very poor"" throughout this viewing of the first episode of this season, greatly diminishing the experience.  It was as though I had smeared Vasoline all over my screen and then tried to view it.  Usually, the quality starts at very poor but after a couple of minutes it improves suddenly--not so this time.  My DSL speed is 15 mps and usually allows excellent streaming quality so the culprit seems to be Amazon's server.  What recourse does one have when this happens?"
"I was hoping is was more like &#34;flip this house&#34;, and was disappointed.  Mostly arguing with family members and not really showing great success with the home."
"If you are very new to the topics you may enjoy this series. And although there are some tiny portions of genuinely new and informative content, it is too little and too infrequent. It is frustratingly condescending and even silly at times for those who are familiar with the topics. None of the episodes are worth watching for veterans of these sorts of documentaries except perhaps the ""Is there a God"" episode.The ""Is there a God"" episode is surprisingly less condescending. The vocabulary is not dumbed down at all and the there are only a couple silly sidebar explanatory analogies. But the approach to the topic is brazenly insensitive, arrogant and potentially offensive to just about anyone who adheres to a religious Faith.From that episode, it looks like Stephen Hawking has chosen to join the ""there is no god"" crowd."
"Note to Hollywood and beyond: I've really grown tired with trick endings.  It isn't that I don't like then because, frankly, I do.  It's that most of them aren't done all that well any longer.  As a matter of fact, once you know you're trapped inside a motion picture that undoubtedly will have a trick ending (the first giveaway is that you can tell one's coming), then you begin w-a-t-c-h-i-n-g the film yet you stop watching the story.  You find yourself glancing at shadows.  You listening for verbal clues to secret identities or dropped Easter eggs.  You're seeing that body over in the corner of the screen, and you're wondering, ""Hey, why is it the director never shows me who that dead guy is over there?""  At that point, it's stopped being a legitimately entertaining experience and started being an exercise in cognitive reasoning ... and that's not the reason I spun the disc in the first place!(NOTE: the following review will contain spoilers solely necessary for the discussion of character and plot.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I suggest you skip down to the last paragraph for my final assessment.  If, however, you're comfortable with a few hints of `things to come,' then read on ...)George (played nicely by the reliable Rupert Evans) is a down-on-his-luck musician who - in order to make ends meet - takes a job as `chef' at the local insane asylum.  (Where did he get such a romantic background and why is it he can only find a job cooking at a virtual prison?  Ah, ah, ah!  Don't start looking so closely so soon, viewer!)  In order to make his existence a bit more palatable, he somehow manages to have all of the members of his band also hired at the said institution.  (Wait a minute ... how exactly does that happen?  Ah, ah, ah!  I warned you about thinking too much about the plot!)  But before you can say `twaddle,' a freak electric storm knocks out all power to the normally secured building (AND the back-up generators?!?!), and George and his friends are left locked behind bars with time running out on their own sanity as the inmates seize control!  (Well, how in the Sam Hill is that even remotely ... FOR THE LAST TIME, DIDN'T I WARN YOU TO STOP THINKING ABOUT IT?!?!)ASYLUM BLACKOUT didn't make much sense from the get-go, but, to its strengths, it's certainly grounded in some solid work by all the players, a wonderfully moody atmosphere complete with all of the usual `locked box' scenarios, and some fine dark'n'gritty filmmaking.  Were that enough, I'd probably be willing to give it more than a respectable two-and-one-half stars (most of which is solely for some solid technical and acting prowess); but, sadly, all of it revolves around a central conceit of the trick ending.  I couldn't tell you exactly when I started to suspect exactly ""What"" was going on - it's fairly predictable as a trick ending, I might add - though, based on my description of the plot, methinks you can tell it was early on.Narratively, it is structured very well.  It's a tidy 90 minutes, broken into clear thirds like a classic three-act play.  The first 30 minutes is set-up of all the players; the second 30 is when the black-out occurs and everything goes downhill fast; while the final 30 clearly begins pointing toward the ruse you'll probably see coming.  Suffice it to say, folks aren't exactly what they seem ... but the critical failure of the particular subterfuge of S. Craig Zahler and Jerome Fansten's script is that, by the final third, there's no room left for subtlety.  What should play out as mind games end up being something fairly close to torture porn - a plot device used way too frequently in horror films these days.To further beat the dead horse, the dodge they use makes little sense to the chronology of the film: the final moments are a book-ended revisitation of the picture's opening segment, forcing you - the viewer - to suddenly realize what you may have just seen may, in fact, NOT be what you just saw.  While others might find this `genius' or `groundbreaking,' I found it more than a bit fraudulent.MODESTLY RECOMMENDED.  It's probably a one-off picture for most people (meaning it's worth a single viewing).  The ultimate problem with ASYLUM BLACKOUT isn't in its performances or execution; rather, it's in its conception.  Given the nature of the story - think of a really good episode of `The Twilight Zone' that went too far - is that once you know the ending, you have to re-evaluate everything you've seen heading up to it.  When you look too closely at the seams, then suddenly you realize you're W-A-T-C-H-I-N-G a movie instead of being immersed in one - the way you are a really good book.  Instead of enjoying it, you realize that you've been duped - and not in a good way - only now you've wasted the last 90 minutes and can't get `em back ... which is kinda/sorta like what happens to George."
"[BEWARE: The following review of ""The Asylum Blackout"" contains minor spoilers.]The title tells everything about the story. Well, apparently. In ""Asylum Blackout"" (aka ""The Incident"") George, an aspiring rock musician (Rupert Evans), is seen working as a cook at the Sans Asylum. One night, while working at the asylum's kitchen with his friends and band members Max (Kenny Doughty) and Ricky (Joseph Kennedy), there is a power failure due to a storm, and they are trapped inside the facilities with the inmates, who start attacking the guards.Director Alexandre Court&egrave;s (his feature debut) takes time in setting up the character of George - serious-minded and short of sleep - and does it very well. George is very tired and clearly needs a rest, while the story unfolds from his viewpoint. George says the riot is instigated by a certain inmate, but is it true?""Asylum Blackout"" has a few violent and gory torture scenes, but as the film's bizarre conclusion suggests, it obviously attempts to be something more than a survival horror, something more psychological. While the dimly-lit photography and stylish camerawork are effectively employed to represent the disturbing situations that surround George, there is also something wrong with the film's premise.For, in order to make the film an engrossing psychological thriller, you need, besides atmospheric photography, better narrative skills in telling the story. While watching the chaos that is going on inside the asylum, we ask ourselves: how come these security guards are inadequately armed when they are supposed to deal with violent and dangerous inmates? Why do the police take such a long time to respond?The film has potential for a more unnerving horror, but to create one you need a set-up that is more credible and intriguing."
"Now I know that anyone can make a movie.  The grainy black and white filming was interesting, and really didn't add to the movie.  It's like they said &#34;We'll save money if it's not in color&#34;."
"ONE GREAT THING IS THAT THIS IS NOT A &#34;FOUND FOOTAGE&#34; MOVIE!Filmed with grayscale effect and at some scenes it will go into full colour. Yes, it will go into full colour especially on those scenes that has upper body nudity. In terms of demon characteristics of the characters, I find it weird how a succubus is portrayed in the film. Succubus does not make a dead person comes alive!Exorcism does not work as it is portrayed in the movie. Demons don't die. It can only be banished. And you have to make the demon tell you its name to banish it.The following are what I found good in the movie:-Audio overlay throughout the movie-Yay! Not one of those handheld camera movies :DThe following are what I found to be no good in the movie:-How the story escalated-Lack of research regarding demons and spirits-Sexual scenes are the &#34;honey trap&#34; of the movie; you don't need those scenes in a good horror movie!-Please stick to one video format; either grayscale or colour but not both!"
"This kept coming up on my ""Recommended"" page because I've been watching a lot of BBC series on Prime lately, so I thought, Oh, why not.This was a joint production between ITV and PBS, designed primarily for the American market.  This explains the heaving decolletage and lip augmentation for the ladies, and the too-long hipster haircuts on the dudes, one of whom looks for all the world like Bob Dylan in his mid-60s Carnaby Street phase.  Theoretically, the movie is based on a novel by Jane Austen.  But even if you're not an ""Austen purist"", it would be hard to class this movie as anything other than a guilty pleasure, though I couldn't tell you where the pleasure is to be derived.  If you want an uncomplicated adaptation of Austen that focuses on the love story to the exclusion of all other concerns, I recommend the Gwyneth version of ""Emma"" -- at least that movie is occasionally humorous.I'm finding it hard to find things to say about this production.  It was over in about and hour and a half.  All background, characterization, and nuance were thrown overboard in order to connect the dots on the map in the most single-minded and simple-minded manner that would arrive at the final destination.  The heroine, as played by Billie Piper, bears not the slightest resemblance to the uptight stick-in-the-mud Fanny Price from the novel.  (Well, okay, perhaps that's an improvement.)  Piper plays Price as a coltish ingenue with her hair perpetually down.  And, from the looks of it, bleached.  Hip.Blake Ritson as Edmund is the only actor among the younger members of the cast who seems to be making any effort to play a recognizably Austenian character.  Generally speaking, the younger members of the cast act too ""modern"", particularly the young woman who plays Mary Crawford.  The older actors are hardly given any screen time, so I can't comment on their efforts.The fact that the entirety of the movie was shot on one location -- some grand old pile or other in Yorkshire -- says volumes about the cheapness of the production.  Neither ITV or PBS really laid down any serious money for multiple sets or additional location shooting.  A lazy production for lazy viewers:  an adaptation of a literary classic done in the forgettable style of a ""Hot Pocket"" microwaveable meal.  2 out of 5."
"Did not like this movie, there was too much running and did not enjoy the acting as much as the other version."
"At first, I couldn't understand the low ratings this series got,  but as I watched more of them, I could see a pattern repeating.  Too much reliance on smutty jokes as a whole by each of the comedians, and whether intentional or not, a couple of the comedians seemed to be relying on the same material."
"Not so funny. This appears to be the second tier of comedians. If you are looking for something to laugh out loud with, continue looking."
"This may be related to my sense of humor or my generation, but these people are no Robin Williams, or even Jeff Duham.  Too much commentary on social issues or nu-relatable events instead of relating to common values or situations."
this movie was boring and felt so fake and staged to me.  Did not enjoy it but kept waiting to see if it got better
"I was happy when I found a bunch of new additions to streaming. Until I started to watch 'em. Geez... man, how easy is it to get your flick out there these days??? Movie making used to be a complex undertaking. You have lots of different elements that need to be executed, coordinated, put together, and then finally distributed. Not for the faint of heart! But it must not be that way anymore, judging from the latest batch of secretions up for our viewing pleasure! I will admit I did not put myself through to the end, not even the middle. I immediately noticed that the camera work was subpar, well below even soap opera standards. The acting, if you can call it that, well.... sorry, no. Once we got to the screaming, 'possessed' kid, I bailed. No friggin' way! Seriously man. Just no!"
"Bravo really needs to do better than this.  The three duds you brought on to replace Jill and Alex are just not working.  Please bring back Jill and Alex.  I never thought I would say this, but I am liking Ramona more and more and actually find her to be more trustworthy than anyone else on the show.  I do like LuAnn, but she is becoming too competitive, and I wish she would stop.  I find her, however, to be much more likable than the princess you brought on the show.  I think that Carole Radziwill is an accomplished person, but on this kind of program, she just does not work out well.  She is kind of boring.  I won't be watching next season, and I just got into the Real Housewives of New York, and found it interesting until this year.  Some of the Real Housewives shows are getting old, and this is one of them."
"Aviva Drescher's father George Teichner is a truly disgusting creature. A perfect example of his race. Any decent producer would have neglected to subject us to the filth of George Teichner but in this case, the producers are of his same people, and so don't have such decency."
"Margot (Michelle Williams)meets Daniel (Luke Kirby)and the two feel an intense and immediate attraction. But Margot is married to Lou (Seth Rogen), a cookbook writer and tries halfheartedly to resist. Margot seems bored by her domestic happiness with Lou. She craves excitement. As luck would have it, Daniel and Margot live across the street from one another. After over an hour of teasing, including a blow by blow verbal account of what Daniel would like to do to Margot, they succumb. Margot moves in with Daniel and they have hot and heavy sex including threesomes of various kind. But by the end of the movie, Margot is just as bored with Daniel as she had been with Lou.It sounds like the makings of a pretty good movie but this is so exploitative and unpleasant that watching it just becomes a tiresome chore. One scene in which we see a bunch of naked women in a swimming pool shower had me particularly puzzled. As well as the lovely bodies of Michelle Williams and Sarah Silverman, we see a bunch of older bodies, sagging breasts, pendulous breasts, flabby tummies, wrinkled backsides. What is this for? Is it to remind us that youth is fleeting and age will catch up with us all? Do we need reminding? It seemed just gratuitous and almost cruel to me.The fleeting glimpses of Margot and Daniel in three-way sex were also like peepshow parades. Who does that kind of stuff? These seemed like two nice normal people. The filmmakers had a message and by golly they were going to get it through.For the first hour of this movie, there was a kind of slow-burn eroticism. By the end, just a nasty taste in the mouth."
"Enter Margot (Michelle Williams); saying Margot has a lot of quirks is an understatement. Margot is downright flawed. She's very peculiar with not only the things she likes, but in everything she does. She's afraid of the thought of being afraid; those in-between moments in life. The events that kick off those moments and their conclusions don't phase her one way or the other, but what bridges together those moments is the most terrifying thing in the world to Margot. While traveling, Margot meets Daniel (Luke Kirby); a private painter who makes his living pulling a rickshaw around town. There's chemistry between Margot and Daniel right from the start, but Margot is married to a chef named Lou (Seth Rogen) so things are obviously a little complicated. There's this simultaneous unstoppable chain of events that transpires as Margot gets closer and closer to Daniel, but she feels her marriage to Lou crumbling in the process. It's an in-between moment that Margot has lost all control over.This is the most frustrating movie of the year; hands down. It's nearly two hours of characters being pulled in directions they don't want to go and playing tug of war with their emotions when things could easily be resolved with a few simple actions. For a movie whose screenplay was included in The Black List a few years ago, the final result is a huge letdown. The dialogue is downright atrocious at times. Margot's little ""gaylord"" speech to Daniel being the prime example, but their exchange on the airplane leaves you with a furrow in your brow. Margot says something along the lines of, ""I'm afraid of being afraid,"" after confessing her fears to Daniel to which Daniel replies, ""That sounds like the most dangerous thing in the world."" Really? Because like seven hundred other things come to mind that are way more dangerous.The three main characters leave you with the urge to lobotomize yourself. Margot can't make a decision to save her life and when she finally does she regrets not staying on the path she was already on. Lou is seriously a contender of the most childish excuse of an adult to grace the silver screen. The immature jokes between him and Margot make you want to projectile vomit on newborn puppies and the two of them have the worst pillow talk you could possibly imagine. Daniel is the most interesting of the three, but only because he acts so cryptic and tries so hard to be this enigma. You remember that scene in ""Family Guy"" where Stewie mocks people who think they're photography majors because they took a black and white picture of a lawn chair? That's kind of the way Daniel is with painting.The entire movie can be summed up in four actions; cooking, sleeping, being immature, and cheating on your husband. The end. Cue ""Video Killed the Radio Star."" Thirty minutes in and you're ready for every character to s**t or get off the pot. ""Take This Waltz"" also includes a shower scene with about a dozen women you wish you never saw naked. After seeing it, you'll be convinced that the only reason Sarah Silverman joined the cast was to get naked on screen and brag about how hot she looks.""Take This Waltz"" tries to take advantage of this preconceived notion that you already love this movie even though you haven't seen it yet. It tries so hard to be cute and cuddly and emotional and it winds up being massively annoying in the process. ""Here's some actors you may have enjoyed in other things along with some humor you won't find funny and a horrid screenplay that we insist on cramming down your throat. Oh and people cry a lot, so you better do that too.""It will be a damn miracle if you can finish ""Take This Waltz,"" but if you do you'll have to fight every urge to run off into the night, scream at the top of your lungs, and tell every couple within a six block radius to just end it now and screw the first person they come into contact with because that'll be quicker and easier than pretending to love each other and wasting everyone's time for an undetermined amount of years. Just save yourself the trouble and punch a brick wall; it'll have a better outcome."
"From pretty much the start of this movie I wanted to turn it off.  Not long after my husband said this is really lame. The dialogue was so completely unrealistic and forced and the main character was annoying.  The interactions between both the husband and wife and the wife and the new guy were so unnatural and not what would really happen. The public pool shower scene put the nail in the coffin for us and we shut it off there.  You are just watching and bam you are blasted with a bunch of full frontal beaver shots and not just for a second, but extended. It has no place at all in a movie like this and it pretty much represents the poor, juvenile quality of the rest of the movie."
"This show could have been interesting but the writers and producers (like most reality shows) must think that the general viewing public is just plain STUPID to believe the crap they feed us.One example - One of the mountain men broke down in his snowmobile 10 miles from home in the middle of the night. Also it was -30 below zero. He had to hike back to his cabin (again 10 miles) and fetch another motor (80lbs) and hike BACK 10 miles and install it. Give me a break! All the while you could hear wolf howling in the background. Very bad sound effects. And I guess the camera crew hiked back also.Another scene, another &#34;man&#34; and his brother were hunting down a mountain lion that was coming to close to their residence. They wanted to scare it back into the mountains. They rode horseback for a few miles before coming across the lion. And when they did, they yelled &#34;shoo lion, get away from here...&#34; And the lion ran off never to come back again.Yep... now I know what I have been doing all wrong when trying to get rid of raccoon's that have been getting in my trash. I forgot to yell SHOO!!!"
"Come on, I have lived in British Columbia and knew some real mountain men... these guys are NOT. Real mountain men do not have airplanes, snowmobiles, sawmills, cars or handy neighbors just to name a few things.Then on top of that the show tries to make it seem like these guys are &#34;lost&#34; or in danger when it's so obvious there is a camera crew with (for one example) stage lighting making it much easier to fix the broken snowmobile in what should be darkness. How dumb. Are we not supposed to notice that or are we supposed to think the whole crew was in such peril?On top of that, it's almost as if there wasn't enough dialogue to fill up the time slot with the same dialogue being repeated over and over ad nauseum.This must be one of the worst put together series I ever saw on TV (or in my case the Internet). I found myself watching more than just a few minutes of the first episode because I couldn't believe how poorly done it is.I could make a camping video with more realistic danger than this show."
"I had not been interested in seeing this movie,but watched it after  reading all of the positive reviews. I stayed with it,but basically cannot understand why people liked it to the degree that they did. Virginia Madsen and Morgan Freeman are obviously excellent actors but their lines seemed stilted to me and they did not seem to melt into their characters. The three girls who played the daughters did a very good job.It's a  ""cute"" movie that I would not recommend."
"I would have rated this higher but there are NO SUBTITLES!!!  I should have read previous reviews AND I &#34;should&#34; have noticed that it was DVD-R, printed on &#34;demand&#34; (and they NEVER have subtitles). So what's up with DVD-R on &#34;demand&#34;?!  I was just looking forward to getting season 3 - I didn't read the reviews because I had seasons 1 and 2, and knew the show.  One of the first times I've felt ripped off but I should have been paying more attention - my bad.  The show itself is fine, but they talk awfully fast and REALLY could have used subtitles for those of us who are hearing impaired!"
"This is not as good as the original MobWives.  The characters are boring.  The first or second episode the woman were fighting, cursing, and pulling each others' hair out.  I'm not watching any more episodes.#notmycupoftea"
"I found Chef Ramsay's screaming extremely hard to take. I had not watched this series before, and I would not purchase another year's version. What I did like about it was that more attention was given to actual cooking than on other similar reality shows. And I liked that when it got down to the final three contestants, Chef Ramsay was very kind to all. But before that, I found him angry and demeaning and I can't help but think his approach made it more difficult for everyone involved."
"I had read all of the Longmire books before buying this.  I did not like the adaptation in the series at all.  My neighbor who has only seen the series and not read the books likes it, but I was just very disappointed."
"We watched the pilot, it was okay...enough to make us curious about a second episode.  So we started the second episode and about 10 minutes in while they are investigating a crime involving a stripper they go into the strip club and then the dealbreaker for us was when the female deputy gets up on stage in full uniform and starts dancing around the stripper pole, undressing and down on her knees to supposedly get information out of the male patrons.  It was so lame and once a show has to objectify their female professional lead in such an unrealistic way...we are out.  It means lazy writing and that they are targeting an audience that we don't belong to."
just did not hold my interest for very long.it is more of selling stuff than storage issues involved for most part
"this show is like watching someone play cards, roll dice, or some other form of gamblingwith the bluffing, and each person hoping to guess, and hit the jackpot when they win thebidding war and see if they get some valuable contents. I certainly think it is over pricedand will wait for the reruns on tv."
Completely unreal.  I can't see anyone leaving some of the things they come up with.  No one leaves rare coins and valuable artwork.
"Finished watching the season and it was good, but it was plagued with fits and stops coupled with error messages. Numerous reboots over the few days I watched only helped somewhat. Shut every other program down except that one window and still had problems. Never experienced problems with amazon streaming before. When it worked, the picture was bright and flawless. Other streaming services worked fine on my computer."
Not really my feeling of entertainment. Too much arguing and bad attitudes plus I don't like the rude language. Crap
"The actor who plays Louis Litt is just awful.  He's a lousy actor, and he's truly unattractive.  No tv show would have a female principal character who is this ugly and one dimensional.  Why do viewers have to endure such lousy casting and acting when the character is male?"
"Yet another verry stupid &#34;hollywood&#34; idea of how to &#34;fight a war,&#34; any war.  I especially liked the part where, while being hunted by an enemy who has absolute control of the air and space, the &#34;resistance&#34; find a hospital with a generator and what do they do?  They fire the generator up, light up the hospital like Times Square, and &#34;rest&#34; there for a couple of weeks.  Of course the enemy never notices this brightly lit hospital.  That's ok though, the enemy never notices them driving around, at night, in military tactical vehicles with the HEADLIGHTS ON!  Oh, and we must not forget going out on &#34;patrol&#34; while having extremely LOUD internal &#34;Ihate you, you hate me, we all love one another&#34; fights.  During which, while there is much shouting, no one is paying any attention to their surroundings.Any &#34;resistance&#34; unit, in an occupied territory,  operating like this, would be wiped out in hours.The only reason to watch this show is, there is nothing else on."
"This series started off decently enough, but as it has gone on, it has, in my opinion, become less and less believable. It seems to me that any advanced civilization capable of interstellar travel wouldn't mess around with bombs and lasers. If they really wanted to exterminate the native species, they most likely would have used some kind of genetically engineered bio-weapon that would have a near 100% kill rate. Also, some of the episodes have become more and more like a soap with the various on and off again relationships.I have noticed that this series has been renewed for a third season to air in the summer of 2013. I am not sure that I will waste the time on in next summer."
Slow movie with predictable outcomes. This could have been a winner!!!???  but I found myself bored at times.... GOODLUCKDave
Don't expect any realism when it comes to modern day spy craft. Take this series with several grains of salt. It's clearly a cheaply done series and it shows. I can't even understand how the main character(Piper) ever got the part. I don't even like the look of her and her acting is mediocre at best. Thankfully several other supporting actors in the series hold her up and make the show bearable.
"I do subscribe to this show through Amazon so it was not too surprising when a new one showed up off the weekly cycle.  It turned out that this episode is a prequel to the series and is only 19 minutes long, even though it still costs $1.89.  It tells the story of Augie learning to cope with being a blind agent handler. It takes place in Barcelona and since I haven't been there in 45 years I found the travelogue aspect beautiful.  The story is sort of weak, given that we already had one show about Augie getting blinded in Iraq.  Annie the usual heroine is not in this at all.  It is an OK sort of clip but not worth the price of a full episode."
"there is no way a blind person can do what that character does, which makes it fiction and not realistic.  she is to much into her self and is really not that bright.  too make believe.  there are two excellent actors in this series; however they have minor roles which is too bad."
"That is how I watched this series. It is fun to watch if you expect nothing else than just passing some time watching old fashion TV without paying a lot of attention. The main character's acting is terrible. She is pretty and fit. And there is not scene in which you can believe for a second that she is CIA or scared or being tortured or in love. She looks at every men with exactly the same expression. Which is exactly the same expression that she has when she looks at women. Or walls. Or guns. Or phones. Or whatever. The writing is poor so what she looks at really does not matter. But the series is not bad as in hard to watch. It is quite easy to pass the time with it. It is the old fashion TV formula -- a CIA target is discovered, pursued, and turned or captured in less than a day by an unexperienced, not really compelling pretty girl making cute dog faces without any clever plan. There also some senseless subplots with absurd conspiracies--most of them focused on Russia because here the Cold War has not ended--and the CIA here is run by a married couple in which he is the big boss and she is something of a maternal #2. They could have made a vintage piece, a la Mad Men, and it would have been charming, but comparing this to Mad Men is like comparing the taste of the best chocolate to an used chewing gum."
"They've tried to add more danger, intrigue and heat (suspense and romance) into the show.  I had settled into and was enjoying how it WAS and the change is a little off-putting to me.  Some people might like it better, actually."
"I was on the fence as to whether or not that I should order a season pass.  Guess what!  I should not have.  Had I known that a 20 minute episode (Sight Unseen) was going to be thrown in at a full charge, I would have picked only the full-length episodes to purchase and download.  I feel a bit taken since this so-called prequel IS free online, but not here on amazon.  I feel a bit taken."
This is way to sexually explicit for a young person to act.  I guess the world has changed so that this is normal behavior in some homes.  To bad.
"Well I loved the first three seasons watched them straight through. Its NOT that season four is bad but for me I couldn't stomach it.The series is pretty gory with characters lacking in moral compass in many ways but watching atrocities is not my idea of entertainment, far too raw for me.Acting is always wonderful and written well ."
"I was so dissapointed with this season. I can't figure out why they had to sully up the season with so much filth, sex and bad language. I noticed it consistantly has a low rating so I can see that no one else liked it either. All the other seasons were so good and that tells me that people don't want all that filth. I hope they do better with the 5th season."
"The tagline for Magnolia Pictures ""360"" is ""Everything comes full circle."" That's really about the only thing ""360"" has going for it. ""City of God"" director Fernando Meirelles is at the helm with a cast that includes Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Ben Foster, and Anthony Hopkins. The unfortunate thing is these actors really only feel like they're filling a void and don't really make themselves totally useful.""360"" jumps all over the world; Vienna, Bratislava, Paris, London, Colorado, and finally Phoenix. Seeing how all of the characters connect to one another is really the only drawing factor of the film. You're mostly left feeling like you could've spent a lot more time with certain characters instead of being introduced to so many. Ben Foster is a great example. His character just begins to get interesting when you only see him briefly in montages for the rest of the film. Anthony Hopkins has one really emotional scene during an AA meeting, but mostly feels underused. Jude Law and Rachel Weisz are criminally under-featured. Weisz seems to be rehashing her performance from ""The Deep Blue Sea"" except Rose is a watered down version of Hester Collyer. Meanwhile, Michael Daly (Law) mostly just acts suspicious and then kind of just admits to everything in the long run without much effort. It all just feels so fruitless.How these characters are connected aren't really all that interesting the majority of the time. More often than not, somebody is cheating on somebody else. Aside from Tyler (Foster) and the Older Man (Hopkins), being unfaithful or using sex to make a living is an underlying theme for everyone else. It's just really disappointing. ""360"" initially has this ""21 Grams"" meets ""Closer"" kind of potential and yet isn't nearly as good as either of those films.The drama is edited in a really unique way though. Its execution is a little odd, but is also really intriguing. At certain points in the film, the camera will show several characters on screen at once despite being in different areas of the world. So the screen will be divided into four vertical strips that are devoted to one specific character. Later on, during a phone call, the screen is divided into two horizontal strips featuring both individuals on the phone; one in each strip. The most interesting is when Sergei (Vladimir Vdovichenkov) is driving through a tunnel. The lights in the tunnel begin swirling around the screen which eventually transitions to the side of a parked car. It's just a very unusual editing technique.""360"" feels a bit too overzealous for its own good. While connecting so many characters to one another is extremely impressive on one hand, the characters themselves mostly feel very flat and underdeveloped overall. The film makes good on its promise of coming full circle, but there are so many half written stories in between that the experience leaves you feeling like there's no substance whatsoever.""360"" comes off as introductory without much filling. The intersection is one thing, but what about the road that gets you there? Shouldn't you have time to admire the scenery and get to know at least one person at more than face value during the adventure? ""360"" is a carousel that gets caught up in its own whirlwind and doesn't utilize or know how to appreciate its talent properly."
"Film six unrelated films and film them separately.  Then cross-edit them all with zero continuity or interrelation and you have 360!  The idea is to come full-circle as the title states, but this does not happen here. Most film makers would just say the producers cheated.  The films are not related to each other except at the end, where there is some attempt to correlate crossover. So in watching it, the viewer is constantly wondering when the film is going to make any sense...this never happens, so is disappointing. Filmed in Slovakia, England, France, Vienna and the US we get some international flavor; but this doesn't assist the go-nowhere screenplay or storyline. The weak premise of the film is that opportunities only occur once in a lifetime and so you have to take advantage of them when you can. The screenplay has one basic premise...everyone is with the wrong partner, who they do not love...so it's time to get somebody else! All in all a weak submission, which is more the fault of a non-workable screenplay and storyline than anything else. Just another example of how one weak element in the hundreds it takes to make a film can totally screw the efforts of everyone involved!  Film making is tough!"
This wasn't my kind of movie at all.  I ended up turning it off before I was one third through.
"I imagine this is titled 360 because ""Ring"" and ""It's a Small World"" were already taken. 360 involves a number of disjointed stories that have a way of intersecting or not. There are many indie films out there that do this, some work better than others. The ones that work have quirky stories that hold our interest. This one does not. The stories consist of an escort, infidelity, a sex offender, a man looking for his missing daughter, and a Russian. There may be a few more.The Denver airport was filmed in Minnesota, apparently they figured no one travels enough to either place to notice. While the acting wasn't bad, the stories were presented in a mundane fashion. One of the problems with the film is that you know in advance the story will circle back so you spend your time concentrating on how it is going to do that rather than try to take in what is on the screen.If you like intersecting indie films, try Jason Freeland's ""Garden Party"" a modest production which I enjoyed more than this film.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, and nudity. It had some of each, but really didn't dwell on it."
When a movie has a great cast we have a right to expect a movie to match.  This didn't come close.  It may seem interesting to create a story showing how lives interconnect etc.  But the script in this movie just doesn't amount to much.  The film aspires to be thought provoking and/or profound but I found it just provoking.  Why did I waste the time.  A few good scenes - Anthony Hopkins at an AA meeting etc.  But overall I found this to be a pretentious flop.
"This was a rather long, boring, dry, chronicle of the Queen of England. Maybe the folks in the UK enjoy it."
"HAUNTED HIGHWAY (Prod. Jack Osbourne) is laughable. When they first hyped this show--when was that, 2011?--I expected an honest-to-goodness travel documentary of investigative journalism. Something which, as we all know, does not exist in paranormal shows or else they'd cease to be paranormal.Lately this show has been starring only Devin Marble and Jael De Pardo, both notoriously awful B-movie bit-players (Jack had to go off the show for a while due to an MS diagnosis). While Devin is something of a producer as well as an ""actor"", both of these clods were so much more fun when they were doing FACT OR FAKED. That was a show I liked because they made strenuous efforts to debunk everything.HAUNTED HIGHWAY is the reverse. Osbourne, or whoever conceived of this smelly gym sock, was clearly not serious about anything at all. It always, and I mean ALWAYS, has the air of a cruddy C-list horror flick made in someone's backyard. In fact it often looks as if they are shooting in a backyard in California. And as I said, since the show has been reduced lately to Devin and Jael, well, the horrifically bad acting and scripted ""investigations"" get funnier and worse with each minute.If I have to see Devin fall on his butt into the water one more time, or hear Jael's blood-curdling (totally phony) screams at every little creak, I'm going to stop watching this altogether. Come on, people! There are real intrigues and locations to be checked out, we don't need these two zombies who think they have creds because they did FACT OR FAKED for a couple of years.However, I would like to take the opportunity to wish Jack Osbourne a good-health future. MS is a nasty bugger, which I know from my own experience. All the more reason for Osbourne to get serious if he wants to produce an outstanding, quality show. HIGHWAY is worse than any other show I can imagine.--SOAPBOX TIME--What is occurring with these shows is sad. These shows are being put out there with the claim they are ""reality""--in other words, DOCUMENTARIES. If an advertised documentary is not a documentary, then it is a fraud. It is very simple.Jacques Cousteau and Marlin Perkins faked some footage in every show they ever did, but they always admitted it and they were not trying to deceive their audiences. Even then, I recall it caused a national stink in both cases, and both those great men were in a little hot water for a time. Perkins then Cousteau invented and perfected the reality-documentary-show genre. Pity they did not invent the ""ghost-hunter"" genre; it would have made the standard much higher.The true problem is, we have a law that says there has to be a disclaimer that a show is for entertainment only, which signals that it is a faked show. That law seems to have simply fallen by the wayside--has everyone forgotten the Miss Cleo debacle? Or is it that everyone wants to forget! The disclaimer law I reference was a direct result of Miss Cleo's exposure.That disclaimer has words to the effect that the shows are ""for entertainment purposes only"", and as if that weren't weighty enough, there also has to be some disclaimer that the shows are faked, partially faked, or partly reenacted as applicable. To what purpose goes such a law, you ask?--to let us know what has been faked and what is real, and NO, you can't say fakery is part of reality so it is ""real"" too. That stupid straw man argument has been used for over 20 years and I'm ashamed of anyone who says such a thing.For an excellent example of the right way to avoid fraud accusations, see the disclaimer on Ernie ""Turtleman"" Brown's excellent show,Call of the Wildman: Season 1--see my reviews. I can't recall it verbatim but it states pretty clearly that parts of the show were recreated/reenacted for dramatic purposes.Honestly, why haven't these networks or at least the producers been brought to heel for this major offense?!"
"""Why Stop Now"" is a comedy-drama in which a simple trip to an audition becomes a life-changing adventure.  Piano prodigy Eli Bloom (Jesse Eisenberg) is on his way to the most important audition of his life, but first he has to drop off his mother, Penny (Melissa Leo), at a drug rehab center.Since Penny is not quite high enough to be admitted, mother and son end up at the door of her dealer, Sprinkles (Tracy Morgan).  Since Penny is in debt and Sprinkles is low on product, Eli must play negotiator as the unlikely team hits the streets.  A series of comic misadventures ensues, perhaps too many to make the events even passably possible.  The cast is in top form, however, though each of the principals has been showcased far better in other projects.Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include a making-of featurette, interview with Tracy Morgan, and theatrical trailer."
"Well, I now know once Woody Allen dies, Julie Delpy can take over. Is that a good thing? Nothing wrong with Delpy as an actress but, honestly, 40 odd minutes into this one I gave up. Oh, I left it running till the end but I just flat-out did not care about these characters. The cast are quite the cast of characters but I found I was not laughing nor remotely interested in these self-involved idiots. In fact, I could sympathize totally with Chris Rock's character wanting to go into his home office and check the heck out of this movie.The extras--sorry, I had no patience to sit through them after wasting time on the actual movie. I'll let some other fool give them a shot here."
"It isn't required viewing to see Julie Delpy's 2007 film ""2 Days in Paris"" before diving into 2012's ""2 Days in New York"" to fully grasp or understand what occurs in the romantic comedy sequel, but it would more than likely help you appreciate ""2 Days in New York"" a bit more. However, ""2 Days in New York"" doesn't leave you with this overwhelming sensation to view or revisit its predecessor either. The film leaves you feeling like secluding yourself from your family and any sort of responsibility would be the absolute best thing for you when things get really hectic.This movie makes it seem like living in New York leaves you with no time to do anything ever. Maybe all of this was supposed to be funny; family members who don't know English getting away with things no normal person can just because they're from another country and being too busy to be intimate with the one you love despite talking about it all the time. It just felt sad and kind of pathetic. There's a huge emphasis on language barriers, ignorant racial jokes that are pretty preposterous, and how a simple thing like buying drugs in front of a child can really impact them. Most of the humor seems like it's stripped away for a last ditch effort just to stay on top of an already sinking ship. It's emotionally exhausting more than anything.Chris Rock is surprisingly the best part here. He really breaks away from whatever comedy he has associated himself with in the past and brings logic and reason to an already well developed character. The highlight of the movie is his scenes where he has full-blown conversations with a cardboard cut-out of Barack Obama. The whole brain tumor thing and what it leads to is amusing as well as is when Marion takes Rose to her yoga class. One of Marion's art pieces is a contract for the selling of her soul, which results in this quest for Marion where she's just searching to find herself again. It's very reminiscent of when Bart sells his soul on ""The Simpsons.""""2 Days in New York"" just leaves you feeling drained. Its conclusion feels extremely clich&eacute;, as well. Not only could the movie have ended nearly 45-minutes beforehand, but it's something so simple that always seems to happen in movies containing this plot device. It's like shaking a Magic-8 Ball and getting an ""Ask again later"" type of response. Having too much on your plate and its inevitable consequences outweigh the laughs here. Even though Chris Rock is fairly impressive here, ""2 Days in New York"" is a frustrating attempt at romance that isn't overly amusing or charming."
"I chose to watch this because I typically like Chris Rock and I was hoping for a movie that was light and funny. This movie was more ""artsy"" and that's not my style so this movie just didn't work for me."
"""2 Days in New York,"" a nominal sequel to ""2 Days in Paris,"" stars Julie Delpy (who also directs and co-writes) as Marion, an artists and mother of one child now living in a Manhattan apartment with a talk-radio host Mingus (Chris Rock). One day Marion's family members, her father Jeannot (Julie Delpy's real-life father Albert Delpy) and sister Rose (Alexia Landeau) with her sister's boyfriend Manu (Alexandre Nahon) travel from France and stay with them for two-day vacation, disrupting their hitherto happy home.Chris Rock is surprisingly good as a ""comic foil,"" a (comparatively) level-headed person providing opportunities for other characters to be funny, but, let's face it, Delpy as director or actress is not skilled enough to turn the annoying and embarrassing traits of the visitors and the subsequent situations into a comedy.Marion's father is just annoying. Her sister is embarrassing. Her boyfriend is just silly. Don't get me wrong. I know characters can be annoying, embarrassing, silly and very funny, like Diane Keaton in ""Manhattan Murder Mystery."" But Julie Delpy is no Woody Allen, and Diane Keaton is fun to watch because after all she (and Allen as director) knows what she is doing.So what does Marion want to do? Or Mingus for that matter? With repetitious jokes and so many subplots that go nowhere - with cameos from Dylan Baker, Daniel Br&uuml;hl and Vincent Gallo - ""2 Days in New York"" is a sporadically funny romantic comedy that does not have much of a story to tell, with characters that we really don't care."
"Let me say that I live near The Great Lakes, they are pretty great! But, if you have see any of those Long John Silver fishing shows, it's the same thing. You may be actually surprised what the Lake Superior North Shore looks like...seriously! Plan a trip"
"This season like all the rest is just great.  Only problem is that Amazon is late when it comes to making episodes available.  This is often true with SyFy shows, that we have to wait two or more days.  Fortunately, they can be found elsewhee."
The writers and producers took the series into a direction that is away from the formula which worked well - now it is formulaic and not worth watching.
"While the first two seasons were very good, and season three was okay, this season seems to have lost that indefinable something that made the show enjoyable. It is hard to explain, but something in the chemistry of the show was lost in season four. Some of the characters seem to have lost their depth, and the artifacts, which were key parts of stories past, seem to have become mere props. I'll pass on season 5. Have lost interest."
I had high hopes for this but it just seems to average and plain in it delivery and viewing experience to make you care if you come back week after week.
"I've always enjoyed White Collar, as silly as it is, because of its stylish take on NYC.  But in the last few episodes, it's lost some of the features that anchor at least my interest.  If anyone's paying attention, then:1. We don't need a psychobabble back story for Mozzie2. What happened to the women?  Elizabeth is sorely underused; Diana is barely present; Sara is nowhere to be seen.  These roles are all played by fine actresses who bring humor, class, and pizzazz to what is otherwise a Hardy Boys story.  Bring 'em back!  In fact, a few episodes where the boys are locked up somewhere and it's up to the girls to rescue them would help a lot.3. Is there a writers' strike on?  The actors look embarrassed delivering some of that dialogue."
"Note: I only saw the first 20-30 minutes with XFinity On Demand.This show, advertised as a ""Limited Series,"" whatever that means, has a great cast (Sigourney Weaver, Ciaran Hinds, Carla Gugino and Academy Award winner Ellen Burstyn) and a premise that slowly unfolds. What could be the problem?Within the first two minutes, there's a slew of profanity that heretofore you'd think could only be aired on a cable network like Showtime, HBO, Encore, MAX or Starz. That, coupled with the very frank dialogue, was okay with me. I'm merely making a note of this, as the series is TV-PG and the language sounded like it belongs on television series' like Shameless, The Sopranos, etc. PG means that the language, if there's any, is MILD (hell and damn) and infrequent (ie. occurring not more than twice).What really did NOT sit well with me was that there's a sex scene between Bud and Eva. Do they need to show that on television? The show is rated TV-PG. However, the language and sex scene really amped it up to a TV-MA. Then around 15 minutes later, there's a nasty scene between two males. Disgusting. Does every television show these days feel the sick need to throw in one of those people into a show? And even worse, depict them copulating like the male inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah?I turned it off just as the two males were...e[...] Disgusting. Nasty. Anti-biblical. Immoral. Filthy.I DO NOT recommend this series."
"Interesting idea, not the first time that it's been tried before. I liked ""Commander in Chief,"" the short-lived series about a woman president, better, because it didn't try so hard to play off real people. Sorry to be the lone dissenter, it seems, and this will undoubtedly sound trivial and sexist (and probably is), but:I was offended by the absurdly high and ugly waistbands they dressed Sigourney Weaver in to hide her thick middle-aged waist. They didn't do that to the men with their middle-aged paunches.It amazes me that whoever cast this thought anyone would think that Ciar&aacute;n Hinds is sexy enough to appeal to so many women (he's very unattractive, to me, and what's with that mouth downturned mouth that's apparently an affectation?) or that someone as attractive as Susan Berg, who played the reporter, would find whoever it was who played the editor she worked for attractive in the least (definitely not). And surely they could have found a lot of men to portray the character based on Bill Clinton better and something more substantive for the character to be than such a pathetic sex and power monger.Most of the plots were just silly, not developed, way too contrived.Sigourney Weaver was fine in the part and in her acting as Secretary of State and would-be President. And I liked Ellen Burnstyn and her portrayal of the sniper-witted, functional alcoholic mother of the Secretary of State (do you see a problem there?). But I found some of actors, much of the acting, and most of the dialog (writing) insulting to anyone with average intelligence. An embarrassment, basically."
The behavior is irrational and unpleasant to watch.  Too deep for my taste.  I like to be entertained rather than trying to figure out the plot or trying to explain to myself the rational for the behavior of the characters.
kin of a run of the mill plot
"There really doesn't seem to be enough ""meat"" on this movie to generate much viewer excitement. To the contrary, it is by-and-large a humdrum production, and its main claim to fame may be that the plot is morbidly depressing. Difficult to say why the ""Doctor"" in the story was give such a bad haircut--which was truly distracting. All-in-all, this film would have done better as an okay ""made for TV"" film."
"I guess movie writers and studio exec's think the public are niave or stupid.  Half way through the movie you knew what was coming, very, very predictable.  The only saving grace of this movie was the ending; but then again we as vieweres have seen so many &#34;dream sequences&#34; in both movie and tv, that ending wasn't a surprise either.  Solid acting but here in lies another problem, the characters were not well rounded so you felt no connection to them.  Are we left to pity this Doctor or empathize with him???  Is it business as usual?  I'm sorry, I like Orlando Bloom but this movie is flat from start to finish./"
"Orlando Bloom stars as Dr. Martin Blake, a first year resident under the supervision of Chief Resident Waylans (Rob Morrow).  Blake is loner who has a hard time mixing with the staffers.  He has no friends and lives in a stark but kind-of-cool apartment.  An 18 year old girl comes under his care with a treatable urinary infection.  Diane (Riley Keough) has a boyfriend but when they appear to be breaking up, confides in Dr. Blake.  He is smitten with young Diane.When she is released, her family invites Blake over for dinner.  Their motives appear to be one of thanks but to also prompt a romance between Blake and Diane's older sister who is on the make.  Certainly a doctor will do just fine.  Blake has other ideas.  He's only interested in Diane.  Upon a return visit to pick up a gift basket they had prepared (way too many coincidences in this film) he excuses himself to the bathroom where he alters Diane's medication which lands her back in the hospital.Through a series of inexplicably easy access to medication and IV bags, Blake manages to keep Diane hospitalized, to what end I don't know.  I guess the guy is just crazy.  Playing against type, Bloom gives a creepy good performance.  His character has obvious moral conflicts.  What he's doing seems acceptable to him but the filmmakers never explain why.  At the same time, he's outraged when one of the orderlies makes crude sexual advances toward the staff and patients.  The orderly (Michael Pena) is also a pretty obvious drug user.I don't know where this hospital is but I sure never want to go there.  Evidently they have no security, no cameras and lax supervision.  The film also stars award winning actors Taraji P. Henson as the head nurse and J. K. Simmons as a police detective.  Unfortunately neither is given much to do.  Certainly the film had an opportunity to be something more, but when it ends I don't know what it was all supposed to mean.  Fortunately it's only 90 minutes long."
"I'm a bit torn in my evaluation of the new thriller ""Rites of Spring."" As a low budget shocker, it leaves a lot to be desired with a clunky screenplay that raises more questions than it answers. But I also appreciated that the film attempted to meld two different film genres into one story. If not always successful, it was something that I'd never really seen before. So I'll give writer/director Padraig Reynolds points for originality. ""Rites of Spring"" is really two different films. One is a standard heist picture and one is a horror story. Neither is particularly well developed or spectacular on their own, but it's the mash-up that keeps things interesting. My head is telling me that the movie should only rate about two stars. My heart, however, is pushing me toward three stars just because the idea behind the film is rather bonkers. And I like that! I didn't love ""Rites of Spring"" and probably wouldn't view it a second time, but I enjoyed seeing the two stories collide!The first plot thread revolves around the unexplained disappearances of young women that have plagued a small community. Two girls out for a night are abducted and soon find themselves in a treacherous situation. The creepy fellow that grabbed them seems to be preparing them for a ritual sacrifice. But for what? And is there any chance of escape? The other story revolves around a gang of losers that decide to kidnap a wealthy man's daughter to extract a fortune in ransom. Of course, not all goes as planned. There are some major trust issues and personal agendas within the group. Before the evening is through, they'll have to determine just who is playing whom. But wouldn't you know it? The abducted girls are on a property adjacent to the where the kidnappers are holed up. So a night of crime will soon collide with a night of horror. As the body count escalates, it becomes a battle for survival. Will anyone endure until dawn?My biggest complaint about ""Rites of Spring"" has to do with a lack of genuine plot development. Nothing really makes much sense in the telling. Neither story, as written and presented, would be satisfying on its own and that's a near fatal misstep. The kidnapping scheme is rather ridiculous and we never know how these guys got together to do something so extreme. Meanwhile, the horror story gets the vaguest (and most over-used) of explanations. Reynolds sets up these two separate scenarios, but each one feels a bit lazy (especially if taken alone). Trust me, aside from the mash-up angle, you've seen it all before and you've seen it better. At a brief 81 minutes, however, it is just nutty enough to hold your attention. About 2 1/2 stars. As I said, I'd have been happy enough watching this for free, but it's not something that I'd recommend as a blind purchase. KGHarris, 11/12."
"A kung fu kicking, chainsaw wielding, blood splattered bride screaming ""it's my day"" is my kind of bloody good fun. So, then why is it that the new entry in Spanish director Paco Plaza's soon to be never ending franchise fails to move me. I suppose to be honest and up front I never did really think all that much of his previous (REC) movies, nor the dull nearly shot for shot Quarantine American versions. The films have all been too deadly serious and derived of the kind of fun that makes a good scary movie. And yet, the lighter, sillier, and even reasonably more engaging (REC)3: Genesis still didn't move me.Starting off as a found footage document of the wedding of Koldo (Diego Martin) and Clara (Letica Dolero), for the first fifteen minutes we attend the various wedding day gatherings, toasts, drunk uncles, etc., until we are ready to check that we are in deed at the correct movie and not some projectionist's lame practical joke. Finally, the drunk uncle turns out to be a zombie and through the usual bite unleashes a zombie plague. The title card arrives informing us that we are in deed in the correct theater, after all,  providing that you are still awake.For the next hour the picture moves at a breakneck pace as Clara and Koldo are forced to dawn chainsaws and medieval knight's attire, don't ask, to face down their undead relatives. At a running time of just eighty minutes, once things get rolling they do indeed, thankfully, not let up.(REC)3: Genesis takes a lighter tone that it's grim predecessors, it's full of slapstick humor and strange quirky bits, like the children's entertainer dressed as a SpongeBob knock off, spongeJohn, of course. Think a wedding and four hundred funerals. The problem is, none of it is really all that funny, the humor draws the viewer out of the narrative, often it is badly forced, occasional just plain bizarre, and very rarely hits the mark.Of late the horror genre, so beloved by me and many others, has become tiresome and stale, it`s stuck in a rut that is worst than any I have ever seen. The very fact that the (REC) movies, and possibly even the Quarantine films, are seen at the forefront of the current movement illustrates the distressing point.The stars here are appealing, mostly Spanish actors that I am not familiar with, but a good talented lot. Dolero is very good in the lead role, she's beautiful and forceful, which helps the proceedings move at a more agreeable rapidity. Enhanced by thralling camera work from Pablo Rosso, who helmed the other (REC) flicks. The screenplay, credited to Plaza and Luiso Beredjo, from what I hope was meant to be an ironic credit for original idea by Plaza, Beredjo and David Gallart, is just plain awful, derivative of not only their earlier films, but countless others, it is also chocked full of hideously stupid dialogue, then again that could just be in the subtitling. Still, Clara nd Koldo refer to one another by ""my love"" so many times in the movie's short running time that a drinking game could be suicidal. The show all comes to the same kind of close that we have learned to expect from it's predecessors.(REC)3: Genesis unfortunately adds nothing new what so ever to the genre, for sure some are going to draw comparisons with the much better Shaun of the Dead, but I think that the inspiration lies in a slightly more obscure film from the early 1990's. My feeling is that it desperately wants to be a close cousin to Peter Jackson's truly magnificent New Zealand zom-com Dead Alive, but Plaza's movie winds up being merely brain dead.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com"
"The only good thing about this film is some of the death sequences, but this one is totally different from the previous two REC films. The other two were some of the best foreign films I had seen but this one is too campy and cheesy acting by some of the performers. Skip it and just stick with the first two."
"I was in middle school in 1982, so I'm kinda surprised I don't remember this show. Without the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia, you may find this quite difficult to enjoy. Considering its age (30 years ago!) I wasn't expecting much during a recent viewing, but I was nonetheless mostly disappointed.PROS: Although apparently not a high-budget production, the locations and sets suggest a moderate amount of care and effort, with the unfortunate exception of occasional clips from various video media. Voyagers! would be a fine show to watch with your (young) children if you have any. History as a premise for episodic stories is of course a good idea, and it almost feels wrong to badmouth any show that ends with, ""If you want to learn more about [historical element from the episode], take a voyage down to your public library. It's all in books!""CONS: While the two protagonists were more or less well-cast, their scripts didn't give them much to work with; the acting is basically dreadful by today's standards. I was hoping that Voyagers! would at least make me laugh occasionally: no such luck. When a TV character repeatedly exclaims ""Bat's breath!"" you are reminded that you are not watching a drama intended for a mature audience. I'm not saying that this or any show would be better with vulgar expletives instead, but the phrase ""Bat's breath!"" should give you some indication of what you are in for if you choose to watch Voyagers!I would not pay $ to view this serial. I gave it a shot due to its cost (free on Amazon Prime) coupled with my penchant for sci-fi/ fantasy. After 2 episodes I am shelving it on my list of shows to watch if [by some cruel fate] I run out of good shows to watch."
"I am sitting here trying to figure out why I watch this? Oh I remember, I accidently signed up for it with one click. My bad. Live and learn. What a sad life style."
"This is a kind of amateurish film, with very poor character development. In fact, we only really get to know the female lead. In contrast, portrayals of the mother, father, boyfriend and sister are empty and shallow. While there is some hint of incestuous abuse early on, this thread is cut off with no follow-up. As for the pornography, it consists primarily of some topless shots and what might be called "" dirty talk."" A number attractive women are also shown kissing each other. Some males also do the same. The only bright spot in this production is the physical beauty of the female lead. The ending is kind of amorphous and the acting is sometimes hysterical--as marked by over-the-top emotional outbursts. Watching this film probably won't hurt you, but I don't believe that you'll get much it of it either. For those viewers that do happen to enjoy it, consideration might be given to the very similar movie,""Starlet""."
I FELT THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS VERY POORLY WRITTEN AND EXECUTED. IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS ALL EYE CANDY AND NO SUBSTANCE.
did not enjoy this movie. it was not what i expected it to be. maybe next time i will ask for information about it.
"THis was a very hard story to follow.  The characters were not distinct or outstanding.  They blended together too much.  Although the story is set in the olden days of the US, it has foreign directions which becomes obvious as the stories unfold."
The writer's went over-board justifying the angry black man. The plots were lose and poorly written. The characters weren't believable and I found myself drifting off watching the series to the point I stopped halfway through. Bad In every aspect.
"I have not watched TV since 2007 but just buy DVD's. I liked the fact COPPER was a ""period piece"" but it wasn't anything like I expected. I saw it to be VERY violent & very graphic (I'm sorry, but I don't need to see people throwing up, people being shot and chopped up and LOTS of blood, or people having sex)  I wasn't crazy about a lot of the subject matter in the episodes either.BBC is a lot more lenient in ""censorship"" so there is also nudity, bad language, and definitely blatant sexual material. (I would not recommend this for young people. Then again, kids today are so desensitized......)  The show was fairly well done (but moved a little slow many times) and I liked that they were doing ""new forensics"" (for the time), but I won't be buying season 2 and I will be giving season 1 away to a friend."
We tried watching this show and it didn't pull either of us in at all. About 3/4 of the way through the first episode we agreed that this show wasn't something we were going to add to our Amazon Prime watchlist.
"We looked forward to this show with great anticipation. After 3 episodes it became repetitive. The show did not seem to get beyond the shock of having a little girl want to be a prostitute. Nothing interesting about showing a little girl in the sex trade. There was not any spark between the characters, nor great acting. We could predict every plot line. We stopped purchasing the episodes."
Could only watch three episodes. Blatant attempt to manipulate emotions over abused little girls-- then episode ends by using little girl to accomplish what no self-respecting (and copper isn't) lawman should do for the sake of justice. Series fits the mold of stories from graphic novels-- to give excuse for over indulgence and short cut the plots
"Yet another fantasy produced by Jews (Sherri Rufh, Sam Berliner, Barry Levinson, et al) that prominently feature a black expert, in this case, forensics. Since we know that none such existed in the 1800's, the intentional but subtle brainwashing message here is that there would have been if not for the cruel, ignorant bigoted white society that prevented it, for which we should feel guilty and make atonement. Have you figured that out yet? And in productions that are present-day, it's the message that blacks are fit to rule over us and we should submit to them (when in reality they serve as fronts for Jewish political power). But please explain why in real life there are virtually no black physicists, black philosphers, black mathematicians, black brain surgeons, black rocket scientists, black engineers...heck, there are hardly any black auto mechanics! Could it have anything to do with the fact that where whites have an average IQ of 100, for black Africans it's 70, and for black americans (with most of them having some admixture of white), its only 85? Only in Jewish-produced film and TV are we constantly barraged with this propaganda. Even Barack Obama is only half-black, is of average intelligence (at best), was a failure at Occidental and only got into Columbia because he did so as a foreign exchange student from Malaysia, AND he's purely a media-creature paid for by Goldman-Sachs (again, Jewish)."
Very bloody. um. Didnt get too far...in.. Might not have given it much of a chance I guess on reflection. It just was very .. bloody.
"This show seemed interesting at first, but it just became boring after only a few episodes. I think if I still had cable and didn't have to pay per episode, I might watch it when nothing else was on. But at this price, it just isn't worth it to me."
"Sorry folks.  This may have just been a cultural difference, but.... This was just boring.  Couldn't get through it.  I like sub titles, this one fell short"
"It could have been good,  but it was too slow and somewhat obvious. I think I could have liked it if I had been in the right mood."
"A slow abstract meditation on death that is not at all entertaining.  You're probably not going to actually like this, or glean much from it.  Don't feel guilty.  Just because a movie like this is generally unwatchable and quite impenetrable doesn't make it high art.  I submit that you that this is really just fetishistic weirdness dressed up as sophisticated musing."
This spin off from the Closer I had high hopes for but it left me longing for Kyra Sedgwick.  No one can replace her in this role.  I bought the entire season to try it out and ended up giving up after episode 5.  This series seemed to mostly revolve around Rusty.  The chemistry seemed dead and the magic was gone.  I wish I could get a refund.
"I could only watch two episodes and couldn't stomach anymore. Sharon Rader making 'deals' for murderers' instead of taking it to the jury, I felt ill. It's too realistic. The legal system always wants to save a buck and the victim has no say in the matter, I should know as it happened to me. But worse yet is David being replaced by Sykes, the butt kisser. This woman is a nightmare! Seriously, they added this dumb woman to the 'elite' squad? She doesn't fit in at all. Just too many changes for the bad rather than the good. I'll stick to my repeat episodes of The Closer and leave this to everyone else who enjoys sub-par television. What a huge mistake they made in the direction of this show!"
The same group without the Closer 'Brenda' I think lacks big time and falls flat. It's not nearly as fun or interesting as the Closer was. I really miss having Brenda in the series.
"This flick is simply pathetic.  It tries to channel the raunch of ""The Hangover"" movies with the female angst of ""Bridesmaids"" and fails at every turn.  I have nothing against the girls engaging in the kind of horseplay usually reserved for the boys but here it just comes off as juvenile.  It would help if there were some characters you can root for.  This flick attains the unthinkable by making Kirsten Dunst unlikable.  And her character works with pediatric cancer patients!  The usually reliable Isla Fisher comes off not as a smart person playing a dumb character but just plain stupid.  I guess if you were to point to any positives there's kind of a sweet turn by Rebel Wilson as the pleasantly plump bride-to-be.  If you're looking for a girls night out type flick skip this one entirely.  My wife who is less discriminating than me couldn't stand ""Bachelorette"" either."
"Being a fan of all these ladies, I was expecting something along the lines of ""Bridesmaids"" with a hint of ""Mean Girls,"" both films I liked.  Unfortunately what I got was a mean spirited, unfunny story about 3 unpleasant and unlikeable women, all of whom are too attractive to be in such a state of despair.Regan (Kirsten Dunst) is the maid of honor for Becky (Rebel Wilson) who no one thought would ever get married.  Certainly not before Regan or her other two gal pals, Gena (Lizzy Caplan) and Katie (Isla Fisher).  The trio has never outgrown their party days from high school.  In one scene, Gena gets on a plane stoned and gets into a conversation with a seat mate (Horatio Sanz credited as ""Barely Attractive"") about how she manages to give a man felacio on a scale of 4 to 10.  The film is full of raunchy dialog and the ladies lead the way.  This doesn't bother me but I checked out when Gena hooks up with a former boyfriend (Adam Scott).  After the wedding, Clyde (Scott) stands up and rather than toast the new couple, tells everyone how he bedded Gena and went ""in and out, in and out.""  Really?The middle section of the film is forgettable and hinges on the girls being able to repair the bride's dress that they tore apart while high on coke.  While all this sex talk might make you think, this is going to get better, it doesn't.  All the characters keep their clothes on.  In fact when the boys go out to a strip club the night before the wedding, they don't seem to be concerned at all that the strippers...well... keep their clothes on.  Huh?  Yeah, girls giving lap dances in their dresses.  Where are these places?  I want to be sure to keep my distance."
"The story line just does not really work properly. The actors are not doing a bad job, but I spent the entire movie thinking that something was missing to make this work or at least believable. If you have nothing else better to do, I would not call watching this movie a waste of time."
"Three former high school friends Regan (Kirsten Dunst), Gena (Lizzy Caplan) and Katie (Isla Fisher) are shocked when they learn that another high school friend of theirs Becky (Rebel Wilson) is getting married. On the day before her wedding, the three girls rip the wedding dress and have to fix it. (But why do they have to fix it? If they are really mean and self-centered, as the film shows, why not hide it and pretend they don't know anything about it?)That the main characters of ""Bachelorette"" are all mean-spirited and selfish didn't bother me. I enjoyed watching ""Carnage"" and to a lesser degree ""Young Adult."" In making comedies and dramas, you don't have to make your characters sweet or likable as long as they are interesting or funny, and more importantly, believable, to sustain the film's running time. That does not happen in ""Bachelorette.""The characters are honest to the point of being totally nasty. That is fine, as being nasty is not mutually exclusive to being funny or even attractive. The problem is the story is not only unconvincing, but is uninteresting. Characters are not fleshed out. Drug/sex-related jokes are clich&eacute;d. There is some smart dialogue, and the talented cast gives their all, but sometimes it seems writer/director Leslye Headland just doesn't know what she wants them to do.While watching the uneven mid-part of the film, I expected these girls to raise much more hell. That didn't happen. Jokes and crude remarks, themselves alarmingly real, may work as a sketch, but a feature movie needs more than that."
"First let me preface by saying I've followed Doctor Who through most of it's lifetime, never got that excited about it.Then there was the whole Russel Davies resurrection of it and I was hooked.  It jumped the shark a lot over the seasons, many omg what were they thinking moments, but if you twisted your ""head"" just right, it was a pretty enjoyable experience and I've watched seasons 1-6 multiple times and not regretted the price of admittance (Amazon for a lot of it).Season 6, enjoyed it, though was getting a might tired with the ""and then there was a paradox... and everyone lived happily ever after"".  Moffat, I've loved his stuff, Hyde and Sherlock being two series well worth watching.  Though admittedly several years later I still puzzle over Hyde.That said...  This season for whatever reason they're doing ""small stories"", that winds up being pretty boring and predictable.  They're getting rid of Amy and Rory (that's happened in an episode that's aired already so not viewing that as being a spoiler of any sort), and they wind up spending way too long with everyone giving each other long sad looks.... Boring.In this specific episode, plot was predictable, their work on having the Doctor being at a ""darker"" place since he's been wandering around without companions a lot doesn't work all that well.  The cyborg in the episode, well, I think I could come up with something better looking.Alien ship lands in the old west in the USCyborg looking for the doctordoctor and companions show upI'm being kind by giving it two stars and no have no desire to see the episode again, just not that much fun."
"I don't know why writers have this overwhelming need to bring down every happy couple. Why can't some of them remain happy? However, it turns out the divorce doesn't really happen and Rory and Amy love each other as much as they always did. Sorry, spoiler.Lots of color, action, bangs and noises as usual. Not much of a plot. The final couple of twists to the story were interesting, I won't add any more spoilers, though.I like Matt Smith as the Doctor. But the Matt Smith stories lack the emotional depth and character interest of the David Tennant stories. That's not Matt Smith's fault. It's the fault of the writers."
"SPOILER:  Finally the overworked Pond companion is finally written off.  Steven Moffit again wrote another bad story, but it does not matter because the most irritating and annoying of companions ever conceived for Doctor Who is gone.  He at least was able to do that, but again in a very predictable way.  I hope the new British female model they hired as the next companion can actually bring some talent and creative interest to a sadly fading storyline, which gets worse each episode, starting from the beginning of last season.As I stated in my first review of this season, (just after the first episode) the Doctor Who saga is in desperate need of an injection of unpredictable story lines and crafty inventiveness, which Doctor Who used to be infamous for. The writer for the past few seasons refuses to bring anything fresh... this of course means no new creatures, new planets and worlds to a 50 year running saga, which is my favorite SI-FI of all time.  I do appreciate that the BBC keeps on releasing older episodes, from last century, back again in DVD and remastered. For those of you who only got into Doctor who since 2005, you would do well for yourself in investing time into the previous adventures since they truly mirror the genius behind the reason why the legend of the Doctor has lasted so long on television, and not just in England, but everywhere around the world.It is just so disparaging that the worst writer ever of this show, is getting cart blanche in making all of the new episodes (not fresh, just new) and dragging the franchise down with his predictable, repetitive and boring style of writing, which disgraces the great name of the series.  Instead of another female British model as a companion I really wish they could bring about a real person we all can identify with, like a Donna Noble, who (in my opinion) should have been kept on as long as boring Amy Pond did during her OVERLY long run on the show.  It would, at the very least, have been more fun and more entertaining, because for one thing, she can believably act.Anyway, cross your fingers and hope with me that the rest of the season and seasons (hopefully to come) will improve now that there has been a cast change.Thanks for reading my review."
"I am a true Doctor Who fan and a true science fiction fan, so I am used to a lot of fantasy.  But there is a point where it is too much.  I only watched the first two episodes.  I got tired of watching wildly unbelievable events that occur for no apparent reason.  I really miss the thoughtful plots of the older Doctor Who's.  Amy Pond is great but she is the only part of Season 7 that I like."
"Despite how many people dislike her, I actually like Mindy Kaling. She has a quirky enough charm to her, where she's worth watching. And unlike her Office character of Kelly Kapoor, in real life, she's actually pretty smart, despite her ditzy voice. So, all of her more real life magic and charm was expected for her breakout series, ""The Mindy Project"" (which came about from ""Untitled Mindy Kaling Project"", meaning this show really doesn't even have a real name, to it).And while Mindy's chick-flick charm, mixed in with small flashes of intelligence or competence does work here, she simply isn't enough to hold an entire show. While her best friend and Office co-star, BJ Novak is also working on this show with her, and she has some backup in the form of NBC buddy cameos, like Seth Meyers and Ed Helms, the fact of the matter is, none of the rest of the show is good: Her believability as a doctor (unless you were to get racist and assume it's because she's Indian), her insufferable and BORING supporting cast, and her premise of being an adorkable girl starring in her own self-imposed ""life as a romantic comedy.""The show is supposed to be a companion show to ""New Girl,"" but at least 'New Girl' has it's niche: It's a girly comedy with enough manpower and masculinity in the form of her support cast roommates that it balances itself out for all audiences between 16 and 30. However, ""The Mindy Project"" doesn't have any of this, and it's only real audience seems to be girls ditzy enough to be into Kate Hudson movies, like Mindy Kaling/her character, herself. There is no real audience appeal, because not all women in their late 20's/early 30's are like Mindy, and honestly, there's no real reason for men to watch, at all. The show isn't funny enough to break any demographic barriers, either. It's mostly not funny, at all. Add in NO likable or interesting support characters, and a boring career premise with Mindy as a 'stupid, yet smart' doctor, and it's just overall lame. Even at it's BEST, it's a mediocre comedy.Mindy Kaling herself has the energy, charm, and pep to at least hold the show on her shoulders for maybe a full season, if that long, but none of the other elements of the show are really worth it. To sum it up: The show sucks and Mindy Kaling alone can't support it."
if your interested in watching a woman whine like a little kid this might be the show for you.  I think my wife likes to watch it just to enjoy someone else go through pain.
"(SPOILERS) documentary discusses Hollywood's transition from film to digital, i.e., how hard the movie industry fought digital, how George Lucas' tenacity helped get it established, and the mixture of emotions (some wistful) from filmmakers seeing film move out and digital move in.  In some ways, film to digital is an example of a way our species adopts new technology: someone discovers a new tool, or a better way (in the case of digital, George Lucas and his team); the established guard (Hollywood) resists, as they've invested heavily in the old technology (in terms of time, learning, and money), plus the new technology has some disadvantages (initially digital not as good visually as it is today), and the technicians, and everyone working in film, doesn't know how it works, or how to marry it with their current way of working, all of which generates fear/anxiety - so they basically ignore it;  while others (who have less to lose and most to gain, i.e., Robert Rodriguez, and other young and/or poor filmmakers) enthusiastically embrace it, exploiting it's advantages (real time viewing of photo capture, cheaper, and after a learning curve, ease of editing, etc.), to create their own brand of art, a significant amount of which becomes successful thus getting the attention of Hollywood who seek to emulate their success.  So now, by 2013 we see digital adopted into the Hollywood mainstream.  I'm a big fan of Keanu Reeves, which is why I wanted to see the documentary, and I'm an even bigger fan of George Lucas, who wrote my favorite film, Star Wars, A New Hope, so it was great seeing them, and all the other filmmakers and technicians talk about film.  Alot of what the technicians discussed went over my head.  The documentary itself wasn't told in an especially engaging way, but it was okay.  Probably will be of interest to future filmmakers studying film history.  For me, an ordinary viewer in the present, two and a half stars."
"I'm usually down for a good film-based documentary, so I decided to give this one a try as it looked like such an interested concept.  While it was indeed a very intriguing subject, one has to truly be a hard-core film buff (the technical stuff) to really get into it.The topic of ""digital film"" vs ""celluloid film"" truly is a fascinating one and deserves a documentary like this.  Whenever a medium change is about to define any industry, it is always a turning point filled with pros and cons that must be discussed in order to obtain some sort of understanding.  That concept is the high point of ""Side by Side"".Sadly, I wish they would have made this doc a bit more ""user-friendly"" to those (like me) who wanted to see the comparison ""in action"".  There is far too much ""talking"" and far too little actually comparison of the two film methods.  Clearly, this was a doc made for not just film buffs, but more towards camera buffs who really get into the technical stuff.The choice of Keanu Reeves as narrator/host is also a terrible one, as his dry, bland story lends nothing towards the excitement factor.Thus, ""Side by Side"" will be a great little doc for those internally fascinated by film.  If you are just a ""movie fan"", however, you can probably skip it."
"I think the online price for this was high; however, I am glad I did not pay to see this in a theater.  It was plodding and the only value in watching was some of the special effects and costumes.  I doubt if this film will be in theaters long."
the plot was ridiculous and the story line was over all very very slow  its pace was sleepy and i lost interest after the first 20 minutes the story line is very very predictable girl get kidnapped girl gets rescued bla bla bla  dont waste your money
"Well, I rented this movie after seeing the behind the scenes for it and it looked good, but the actual watching of the movie was slow, did not show the action that looked so cool during the movie behind the scenes.  It was ok but not the best."
"Definitely worth watching. A lot of action and 15th century B.S. about God and the Devil. If it were true, they certainly could not be defeated by swords. It's worth a watch but I wouldn't set my hair on fire hurrying to get it.Dark and confusing plot. Leaves a lot of holes to the imagination.  It is all a strange Devonshire movie with heavy accents and two bit metal and amazingly accurate flintlocks, which had not been invented yet, used to kill.Generally makes no sense, but Good wins over Evil as always.  I would wait until it is Prime Free."
"So I thought that this show would resemble Gilmore Girls since the creator Amy Sherman-Palladino had created that show lasting seven seasons, and that the grandmother form Gilmore Girls is a central character on this show. However, I was proven wrong, this show doesn't resemble Gilmore Girls at all, it's about a Vagas show girl who teaches dance in a small town. Granted I haven't finished the first season, but it wasn't that interesting and used plot twists early on like killing off a promising romantic partner for the main character. I guess that the network differences between this show and Gilmore Girls could affect the content, but I would hope not. Anyways as a fan of Amy Sheman-Palladino I am disappointed with this show, however it could also be that I am not interested in ballerina's too. I think it's because I am not familiar with the central topic of the show, ballerina dancers. I won' t be watching this anymore, however, on my favorite show on TV, Parenthood, Gypsy's character from Gilmore Girls has a sideline character in season four/five."
"Maybe I was expecting too much from this movie but it was hyped up a lot.I was thinking it was gonna be really scary.  I usually like anthology movies but this was just lame.It's was like watching something like the Blair Witch Projects but as an anthology.This gang of guys who film stupid videos to sell online are hired to steal a VHS tape from a house.One of them ends up watching all these random tapes he finds and each of those shows its own horror story.Most of the stories were kind of lame and reminded at best of some of the crappier episodes of Freddy's Nightmares, as far as acting and writing went.  Just a lot more low budget than that show was obviously.There is one story with a killer in the woods who kind of reminds me of Jason.  There are some creepy parts there but overall this movie was just really slow and boring.The framing device, with that gang of guys, was shitty as hell.  I hated watching those parts and the actors were annoying."
"Possible Spoliers""V/H/S"" so some filmmakers pull various pranks on people they pass by, like attacking girls and exposing their chests to the camera and well.... that's about the extent of their ""talents"" and ""skills. These filmmakers were hired by a guy or girl or could be a crazy koala bear for all I know, to break into an old guys house and find some rare tape, (at least that's what's provided in the description of the film, never made fully clear to the viewer). They find said old guy dead and a bunch of tapes, which as they progress become more disturbing. Before and after each segment we see footage of these guys searching for this tape.The first is ""Amateur Night"" where we have 3 guys, 2 girls, bars, later a hotel room and well some bad ends for everyone involved. One of the girls is a quiet, goth like one who keeps saying to one of the guys, ""I like you"". The moral here, turns out it's true that you really need to watch out for the quiet ones.The second one is ""Second Honeymoon"" where a young couple is in a hotel room, after a knock on the door the husband says some girl asked them for a ride the next day. Then after falling asleep, the camera is back on and someone is filming both of them, taking money from the guy's wallet. There's not much more to this one as things end quickly.The third one is ""Tuesday The 17th"", now we have a camping trip where 3 friends end up as bait for a girl with them named Wendy. There's apparently some killer who is very hard to see even if he's right in front of you. Violence and bad editing galore in this one.The fourth installment is ""The Sick Thing That Happened To Emily When She Was Younger"", Emily and her boyfriend are trying to find out why ghostlike figures are appearing in her apartment and what's with a strange bump on her arm. Guess what follows? A whole lot of lameness honestly and things don't end well for Emily.The fifth and thankfully final segment is ""10/31/98"", a halloween night sees 4 guys in costume, an arrival at the wrong party house, a cult ritual and a bad end for said guys.The concept honestly sounds a lot more interesting than when it plays out, there's nothing very scary in it, the film feels way too long and the whole VHS style editing and feel really gets old and fast. The only plus is there are some very pretty girls in it, including the girl who played the quiet one in ""Amateur Night"". I'll never think of the words ""I like you"" in the same way again. But this is overall a pretty big mess of a movie, where the style falls flat and everything else is very umm.... bad. * out of 4 stars."
"This will depend on your alcohol tolerance, so adjust from the base line (up) if you are a drunk. First, if you are a non to light drinker, drink one-half of a fifth of some cheap whiskey. Wait 30 minutes. Now, stand up and spin around in a circle 40 times. Without taking a break, drive to Wallmart and run up and down the isles. That is what you feel like if you watch this disorienting movie. You should also remember that VHS video looks like crap nowadays, so don't expect too much from that aspect either. Don't pay $10 to see this early, if you feel like you have to see it, wait till its about $1.99 to rent so you won't feel robbed when you turn it off after 30 minutes."
"i had really high expectations for this movie. gotta admit that trailer is amazing. huge horror fan here and the buzz about this movie had me psyched....rented this movie early for the ten bucks, and will say that i feel it was a worthwhile rental, i wont be seeing it again or have the need to.five films. just like creepshow....but all found footage. interesting and pretty well done.gotta say though that out of the 5 stories, only 2 were really any good ( first and last ) ....the third and fourth were awful. no seriously. the acting was insanely bad, like, please kill these people now, bad... the second story was merely entertaining.also...the whole 'people got sick, beware when watching this movie' is hokey and has been done before and better.needless nudity completely takes away from the stories. not a buzz kill....just a fact.some interesting scares but the hype is not warranted....save your money for I Saw The Devil....now THAT is a MOVIE.fun rental but you can wait till its cheaper....not missing anything here but still fun."
"The great thing about anthology films is that, if one of the segments falls flat, you usually don't have to wait too long to get another shot at a decent story. Even better, anthology horrors can side-step one of the biggest problems with the horror genre: the fact that scares tend to stale when you stretch a tale out to feature movie length. Much like some of the scariest campfire stories you heard when you were younger, really scary flicks don't have to be much longer than twenty minutes to pack a wallop, and they have the added benefit of being less likely to drag.That's in theory.V/H/S might have worked a lot better if it hadn't gone for the found-footage theme, a film-making style that continues to plague theaters and films. The idea is that, if you put the movie behind the lens of a home video, viewers will be more inclined to invest in the reality of a story, to feel its presence and immediacy, and therefore to be more drawn into the drama or -- in this case -- chills. What usually ends up happening, however, is the screenwriters have to struggle through exposition heavy dialogue (often regarding why the event in question is being meticulously filmed), and viewers have to deal with shaky, amateur-style filming. Luckily, the short length of these vignettes made camera excuses easy to come by, but this is without question an example of some of the worst blurry/shaky/look-how-headachingly-real-this-handheld-look-is filming I've seen in a found footage movie.There are six tales:TAPE 56: This story provides the connective tissue for the whole movie. A group of hooligans who like filming themselves are hired to go to a strange house and procure a VHS tape. During their search, they watch some of the tapes they find in the house, all of which comprise our anthology. This segment is poorly acted and even more poorly written, but that's mildly excusable given that it only exists to be connective tissue for the other bits. (1 star)AMATEUR NIGHT: A story that could've been told in about five minutes, this little bit is about three young bucks who go out on the town to pick up some chicks and make a little hidden camera porn. Needless to say, they pick up more than they bargain for. The lead actress in this bit is a real trooper and does a bang-up job, and the special effects aren't too shabby. Our three male leads, however, are annoying beyond belief, and the overall ""twist"" of the story you can see coming from a mile away. (3 stars)SECOND HONEYMOON: Our footage this time is in the form of a vacationing couple's camcorder. The story is so basic that even stating one part of it would be giving too much away; I'll just say their honeymoon doesn't end in the traditional way. Filmed and acted quite well, the plot is just too thin to be worth the twenty minutes it's given. It feels like there could've been much more to it if they'd just taken the time to juice up the script. (2 stars)TUESDAY THE 17TH: Four 20-somethings go for a vacation in the woods and, guess what? They have a horrible time. This is one of those scripts where you're asked to believe that four completely different people (an alpha-male jock type, a skinny dweeb, an impossibly hot blonde, and a surly dark-haired misfit) would for some reason be close enough friends to vacation together, in spite of their acerbic dialogue and general lack of common ground. One of them has a secret though, and although the content of the secret is rendered in a pretty cool way via some of VHS's more common frailties (think tracking errors and tape glitches), a total lack of answers and unbelievable plotting ruin the effect. (2.5 stars)THE SICK THING THAT HAPPENED TO EMILY WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER: Told exclusively via webcam chats, this is tied for the strongest clip of the group. A waifish (and kind of dense) Emily has conversations with her doctor-to-be boyfriend, James, who is away at school. A possible haunting and a strange bump on her arm lead to a truly unexpected conclusion. Although the script is almost as annoyingly vague as the last one, there are enough clues to get the point across, and to do so in a way that doesn't feel like a total cop-out or rip-off. (4 stars)10/31/98: Four 20-to-30 something males go out to a Halloween house party, with one of them dressed as a nanny cam (probably the best excuse for a found footage filming that I've come across in one of these movies). They apparently go to the wrong house, however (or they misunderstood what kind of party it was), because what they discover is less party than it is horror. With some pretty solid special effects and a fairly rapid delivery of action, this vignette is also one of the strongest. (4 stars)"
"I love horror movies, and I love anthologies, AND I even love found-footage stuff. Sadly, this is pretty lame.For one thing, it's possible to do horror without having the entire cast of characters be un-relateable douches. Not here, though. Everyone is grating, obnoxious, and obtusely stupid. The first story is so full of screaming and shaking the camera that it's nearly unwatchable. The wraparound story is likewise bad (and it's a cast of douches).Sure, it's somewhat inventive, but you're better off going to watch an hour and a half of amateur stuff on YouTube (there will be less camera shaking and OMG-I-HAVE-A-CAMERA LET ME ZOOM IN ON EVERYTHING idiocy).Pass."
"""We have to break into this house and all we have to do is steal this one VHS tape."" This review will be a little different then the others I have done. This will be different because the movie was different. This first off isn't really a movie at all. They try to put a little plot in but the movie is more like a ""Tales From The Crypt"" type style where there 5 little movies that aren't connected to each other instead of one long flowing movie. The 1st one is nothing but sex and gore. the 2nd is ""Paranormal Activity"" like. 3rd one is a generic college kids on a getaway movie. 4th is a haunted house seen from a Skype point of view and the 5th is like a Twilight Zone type. Everyone of of these little movies started off OK but everyone had an anti-climatic ending and left you more and more disappointed. This really is for hard-core horror fans only. Overall, a strange idea that really will only work for hard-core horror fans. Since this isn't really a movie I won't give it a grade."

A group of young men videotaping their criminal activities (who doesn&#8217;t?) breaks into an old man&#8217;s house looking for a certain video tape. What they found is a dead body and a stack of old VHS tapes.That&#8217;s silly, but still OK. Sadly, what follows is not really impressive, either. I hate to reveal much about the stories of each segment, so let me just say that though some of the shorts have nice ideas &#8211; and gory deaths and some naked women &#8211; none of them has managed to fully develop them into a compelling narrative.In short, the 116 minute film feels long with largely boring shaky cam footage."
"First, let me mention that, Michael Scott aside, I was a fan of this show just as much for Jim and Pam, and if they end their relationship on a ""divorce"" note I will NEVER invest in another show by these producers. Guess what? Breaking up a happy family to go out on a high-minded story arc is a betrayal to the fans, and here's one more fundamental truth: DIVORCE ISN'T FUNNY!!! These characters deserve to end the show as much in love and together as when they started.I am a STALWART fan of the series, and have been since it's American debut. I think the humor of the show was that most of the other people in the show were REAL people and Michael was the insane one. That is what the show was about, how a crazy manager interacts with real people. Michael was shocking, irrepressible, irredeemable, and loud, inappropriate at the worst and most inopportune moments, and almost entirely oblivious to it (which was also his saving grace). The moment a light of understanding hit his brain, he would suddenly become human, attempt to back pedal, and then begrudgingly apologize.It was this that made the show. When Michael left the office, the curtain should have closed, the lights turned up, and we should have been made to leave our seats. Instead, seasons 8 and 9 continued to turn the carcass over and make a mockery of the quirks of each character, way, way over emphasizing the suddenly, equally quirky traits of the staff. If it's one person being a fool and all around staring in awe and disbelief, that's an out of the ordinary moment. If everyone is cavorting around foolishly, there's no awe or disbelief.Here's the primary example: Michael tells the new temp Ryan to play along with a prank he intends to play on the receptionist Pam. Ryan, not yet aware of Michael's insanity, nods, and Michael calls for Pam.Pam walks into the manager's office, and Michael informs her that his choice in which employee to fire in their ongoing campaign of downsizing has been made simpler. Because she has been identified as an office supply thief of potentially thousands of dollars over 3 years of employment, she will not only be terminated, but will not even qualify for severance because of the punitive nature of her dismissal.Ryan shakes his head, non-verbally disavowing any participation in the ""prank"" as Michael stifles a gleeful chortle. Pam, however, begins to frown and denies the accusation, claiming that she has not even stolen so much as a paper clip, but Michael casts her plea aside and tells her to clean out her workspace.Pam begins to cry profusely, a reaction Michael at ONLY THAT MOMENT realizes is a bad turn. He promptly cries, ""You've been 'punked'"" and laughs, sticking to his joke even as it careens into a deadly plummet. Pam calls him a jerk and runs off.In another episode, Michael makes small talk with Pam and mentions the common phrase, Thank God it's Friday, and that it's another day overworked and underpaid. Pam's only reaction is to say, ""I know what you mean,"" and Michael suddenly becomes stern. He says, ""if you are unhappy with your compensation, bring it up with HR.""Michael is clearly a character with huge flaws that all the other cast members have to tip toe around in order to get a solid day's work accomplished. None of the other characters exhibited signs of silliness, but as the seasons went on, the characters evolved their own various issues that, while making them unique, also made them all seem like cartoons. They stop tip-toeing and begin bumbling around Michael Scott style.Jim and Pam's relationship was the other huge staple of the show. Just because they're married doesn't mean their ""adventure"" is over. I married my wife and it felt like life had only just BEGUN at that moment. Pam should have been able to make something of her art. When she failed, it felt like the show was saying, ""Just give it up, kids. You're going to stay mediocre regardless."" Jim's ambition to become a sports agent should have been much smaller, and he a lot more understanding of what he's putting his wife through. It's like nice, sweet, cool Jim has been replaced by Jack@ss Jim. If that's what we're left with, then none of his good moments, kind deeds, and hard choices have EVER mattered. He's just going to end up a douche eventually. NICE!"
"Unless they ramp things up quickly, this is just about dead. Nothing new, interesting or clever here.  Seems Poehler is just dropping into the old corporate mold as fast as she can.  You've come a long way, baby.  Yeah-right."
"too many attractive people are living under one roof in an upper class section of LA. The movie drips with what can only be called a sunny narcissism. Yes, there's trouble in paradise, though for all their well-intentioned pretensions, none of the characters seem particularly bright enough to look past their narrow horizons, much less their own worst impulses. Perhaps this is why film makers shouldn't live in LA; they cut their cultural teeth on the town and wind up making films like this."
"Given the screenplay was co-written by Lena Dunham, creator and breakout star of HBO'sGirls, I was hoping this 2012 indie relationship drama would resonate strongly like Lisa Cholodenko's acclaimed Los Angeles-set films (Laurel Canyon,The Kids Are All Right), especially with such a smart cast of actors. However, something feels amiss in director Ry Russo-Young's coolish approach to a familiar story of adulterous deception and family dysfunction. The pacing feels glacial, and the characters are just not that involving emotionally. Perhaps that was the intention in showing the shallow nature of the lifestyle being portrayed, but it rubs off on the film's inertia leaving it feeling quite flat. The setting is LA's funky-chic Silver Lake neighborhood where sound engineer Peter lives with his psychotherapist wife Julie along with their young son and her teenaged daughter from a previous marriage, Kolt. They epitomize the laid-back, everything's-cool attitudes one associates with affluent Southern Californians.Enter Martine, a New York acquaintance of Julie's college friend  who happens to be an attractive 23-year-old experimental filmmaker. She has agreed to work as Peter's assistant in exchange for him helping out on her latest project, an arty video installation revolving around close-ups of ants. How Martine emotionally invades the family is the crux of the story, and to the credit of Russo-Young and Dunham, she never comes across as an unrepentant interloper like more commercially driven exploitative films have done in the past. It's just that the plot pretty much goes the way you would expect it would go from the outset, although the characters carry decidedly ambiguous natures that make some of the story turns feel more complex than they really need to be. For instance, the inevitable tryst between Martine and Peter lacks believable passion because it feels almost matter-of-fact. In hindsight, I feel like it should have been the driving force in pushing each character toward self-examination.The cast is not really at fault here as the acting, for the most part, is sensitive and assured. Olivia Thirlby (the best friend inJuno) provides the requisite gamine quality needed to make Martine credible as an object of obsession even if her character remains a cipher throughout. The always becalming Rosemarie DeWitt (Rachel Getting Married) delivers a thoughtful balancing act between earth mother and jealous wife as Julie. John Krasinski has a bit harder time escaping his amiable good-guy image fromThe OfficeandAway We Go, but he does provide some surprisingly heated moments as Peter that make you wonder if he could do a greater variety of roles onscreen. As the constantly yearning Kolt, India Ennenga appears to be channeling early Claire Danes, but she makes the character's unrequited love palpable. In smaller parts, Justin Kirk as a horned-up Hollywood screenwriter and Julie's attentive patient and Dylan McDermott as her self-possessed ex-husband bring much needed alpha energy to the proceedings. A late meltdown scene with Kolt's smarmy Italian tutor (Emanuele Secci) feels very out of place. Lethargic viewing."
The story is kind of lame and I lost interest halfway through. The story also does not makes much sense. Skip it!
"Overall, I didn't care much for this film. It does have some highlights, like Hugh Jackman's portrayal of a pervy car-salesman, and the cute young girl named Destiny, but that's about it. Jennifer Garner and Ty Burrell have some funny moments, but they are just MOMENTS and can't carry the whole film. I actually found the whole ""let's make fun of middle-America"" thing a bit on the vicious side, and Olivia Wilde's character was just gross. I was glad that I didn't have to pay to see this one."
"I had heard many good things about the movie BUTTER before I had the chance to see it. Critics were treating it fairly nice and word of mouth via numerous magazines said good things as well. So I went in expecting something quite different than what I got.The world of BUTTER revolves around the annual Butter Carving Championship held at the Iowa State Fair. For the past 15 years the winner has remained Bob Pickler (Ty Burrell). Ty is a good natured man who has done an amazing job with his sculpting, his last being a full sized replica of the last supper. Bob is married to Laura (Jennifer Garner), a prim, proper and respectable leader in their community who feels that Bob's 15 years of winning may lead them to greater things like being the Governor or perhaps even one day the President. Not only is Laura a respectable member of the community, she is one that is feared as well. No one will mess with Laura or what she wants.When the championship committee makes the decision to ask Bob to step down and let someone else win for once, Laura goes on a rampage. She views it as the world trying to take down her and her family, never once thinking that perhaps it would be encouraging for others to be involved. When Bob refuses to enter, Laura does what she considers the next best thing and enters herself in the hopes of retaining the family legacy.But this won't be the easy win she expects. A storyline running alongside the Pickler family is that of Destiny (Yara Shahidi). A young black girl in an orphanage passed from one foster family to another, Destiny has landed with a new couple, Ethan and Julie (Rob Corrdry and Alicia Silverstone). When Destiny happens across Bob and his sculpture at an exhibition she is amazed and picks up on carving butter herself. A natural at it, she decides she wants to enter the competition as well.Also entering the competition is Brooke (Olivia Wilde), a stripper that Bob had a fling with and who he owes $600. In an attempt to make his life worse than it already is, Brooke continues to show up at Bob's house demanding her money and finally enters the competition just to spite Laura.So far this sounds like a decent satire of the whole competition scenario that we've had before in films. Instead we get something a little different that actually turns out to be a bit more hateful than one would expect. I mean granted when it comes to movies made about the Midwest people will always be portrayed as closed minded and redneck, the whole clinging to their guns and Bibles sort. For some reason Hollywood finds a lot of humor in that. While they continue to laugh uproariously at those sorts of things I find that it's more of an easy out and lazy comedy than anything.This is not to say the film fails completely. At the start it truly has some funny moments. It's well made and does feature some really good performances. But then somewhere along the way it veers off and decides to get nasty and mean instead of funny. Laura goes from being an obsessed housewife with delusions of grandeur to what Hollywood thinks of right wingers. She's spouts off profanities when the mood suits her, feels she is entitled to a place of power and prestige, displays racists tendencies and will do any and everything she can to retain the family title. Her character becomes hateful and manipulative. Anyone that opposes her, including a stripper, is offered up as just and righteous.The movie changes along with the character of Laura Pickler. It changes from a movie that has some great humor in it to one that seems more determined to ridicule those the writer doesn't agree with instead. In those attempts to ridicule we see displayed some of the laziest writing around resorting to stereotypes better left to online memes rather than a feature film.One odd thing about those in Hollywood. Anyone who has actually lived in the Midwest always talks about how much they loved their childhood, yet they always seem to find it necessary to insult or ridicule where they came from. And for those who have never visited let alone lived in the Midwest, they always feel they know exactly what it's like to live there. Unfortunately with rare exceptions, they almost never get it right. This holds true in BUTTER.A great example appears in outtakes that roll during the final credits. Ethan and Destiny have a scene where they're sitting in his car and she tells him she's afraid of going in to enter the competition. He begins to tell her that there are worse things that could happen than just entering. Things like piranhas learning to walk and entering the building at the same time to attack. These are things he says to break down her fear and give her the courage to enter. It's a nice scene and in the movie plays well. But in the outtakes one of the scenarios that Destiny offers up is ""It could be worse; it could be a Republican fund raiser"". Gee, isn't that a subtle display of where the thoughts of this writer lay.The potential for a great movie was there. Instead it resorted to the cheap laughs it had that are actually not funny unless you hate Republicans. If so, you will love this movie. If you're a bit more open minded and think there are good and bad people on both sides of the coin, then this movie will offer a few laughs and then toss them all aside to gain political points with Hollywood."
"Cute movie with a unique plot, but far too predictable and often times bland.  The little girl makes the movie, though Jennifer Garners acting is superb.  Not the best, but definitely not a bad movie.  It wasn't worth the Watch While It's In Theaters price though.  I would wait until it is cheaper."
"This movie has a funny cast, but it is anything but funny.  No wonder this movie didn't make any money at the theater."
"I could name dozens of rom-coms from the last decade that this one liberally steals from, but what would be the point?  Perhaps I watch too many comedies.  What should be a simple boy meets girl story is complicated by all sorts of wacky, twisted, and clueless peripheral characters.  Each obstacle to their relationship seems contrived, like a 1978 tv episode of ""What's Happening?"" without the laugh track."
"I am confused about the hype and raves for this film. It is a wanna-be quirky independent film using trite jokes and unreal situations in a world that doesn't require a release form. We are told that Bruce has spent his life torturing and filming his brother Frankie from the film blurb. We get to see one quick episode, hear about a second one, that really had nothing to do with Bruce and the movie is about a third one that again, Bruce (Chris O'Dowd) just happens to film.The whole set up and building of characters was done in a very poor fashion. The get together of Frankie(Charlie Hunnam) and Lassie (Lizzy Caplan) was slightly humorous, but there was no good follow up. Bruce was extremely unlikeable. Frankie only slightly less so. The characters overall are meh, even the over the top Ron Pearlman...""call me Phyllis now"" tried so hard to be funny, that it wasn't.This is a sex comedy that lacks the crudeness of successful sex comedies, and lacks the cleverness of a good indie. It is a hybrid that doesn't reproduce. Some may find it amusing, I don't recommend it, even as a rental.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity."
"I rented this because it had an interesting premise.  I think they could've done more with this.  I really wanted to like it, but I was mostly bored."
"The film opens with people screaming and running around getting killed by an off screen slasher. After that brief teaser opening, 5 girls take off to go camping. Kate (Zara Phythian) is five days back from Afghanistan (guess how her training plays in this). The girls drive, then leave their convertible with the top down to go hike and camp several hours away. The girls are armed with shorts, boots, back packs, and military issue undergarments that can double as a swim suit. It isn't long before they meet some cute boys and become flirty.If you were awake the first few minutes then you know where this goes.This is a &#34;me-too&#34; woods slasher. It offers nothing new. The characters were not well established. Their personality was bland. It was killing for the sake of killing. No cannibals, inbreeding, or a sportsman club. Boring.Parental Guide: F-bomb, rape, nudity (male and female)"
Hard for me to watch.  I view it when I need motivation to clean my own house and throw stuff out.  How can anyone care so much about &#8220;stuff?&#8221;  They put &#8220;things&#8221; over people and that is the most disturbing part.
"I have heard from a lot of people about this show, so I was curious to see a few episodes for myself.  It lives up to the descriptions of my friend, but I was disturbed by how the therapists treated - or rather failed to treat - the underly issues of the &#34;hoarders.&#34;  The show is seriously over dramatized, which isn't unexpected for a reality TV show, but I would expect more from the therapists, who I would assume have a professional duty to treat their patients rather than to just antagonize for the cameras."
"Patty started hoarding when her philandering husband leaves her.  She has two sons.  The cleaning guy with the chin dimple tried to sleep in her house, but couldn't to it.  It was yucky and funny seeing his head resting close to some fecal matter.  Patty has two sons, one married to a man.  ND doesn't allow same-sex marriage, but I'm so happy that the show always refered to Cody as a husband and not some euphemism.  The mother and brother called the husband all kinds of names, but the show doesn't explain why the husband is a bad person.  If anything many rainbow-flag men would have left lovers with crazy family members in a second.  Once the house is clean, the therapist encourages the owner to deal with her feelings.  I don't understand how an empty house makes a woman deal with being dissed by her ex-spouse.  The (straight) son at times has his T-shirt's msg blurred and at other times is seen wearing the Gabriel Iglesias shirt saying ""I'm not fat; I'm fluffy.""  I'm a fatty too and I can empathize with the family, but they did seem morbidly obese.  I do worry about their healths.In the other fact pattern, the woman of the house owes about $50,000 in credit card debt due to hoarded objects.  Her husband had every reason in the world to leave her, but you can tell he doesn't want to in his heart.  The woman had the nerve to say she never wanted sons, although she has 4 of them.  The crew is nice enough to clean her house and she yells, ""I don't like the color of these walls.""  After all her drama, the therapist said, ""She may seem like a jerk to others, but that's the disease controlling her.""  I'm skeptical of that.  It felt like passing the blame.  This woman was just really nasty and when she abandoned by everybody who could have loved her, I think she's going to be quite rueful.  She cries and yells, ""I hate being disappointed.""  I was thinking, ""Then maybe you shouldn't set unrealistic standards for others!""  I kinda wonder if she has anti-social personality disorder."
Been a fan of this series for four seasons.. Understand the desire for writers to push the envelope however this time S5 episode 1 crossed the line. For me anyway. Afraid I am done with the series. Could have accomplished the same plot line and emotional impact without exposing the audience to such graphic and obscene footage. Too bad too because the story seemed to be headed in an interesting direction. Thank you Mr. SUTTER for four great seasonS. Going to return this and give JUSTIFIED a try.
I made the mistake of watching the series from beginning to season five in a fairly short period time. I was ill and decided that I needed to watch something serially. Seasons one through three were great. Season four started to get a little bit silly. Season five was so ridiculous that I just simply quit watching it even though I had already paid.
"I still like the Shakespearean drama component of SOA. But the &#34;action&#34; part is getting really tiresome (say about two seasons ago), it is turning into an adolescent's fantasy, and it is really getting hard to suspend disbelief, or take any part of the show seriously because of it. Look, we know nobody important is ever going to be killed, (even if chained and handcuffed, they will find some miraculous way out because TV villians have never heard of Occam's razor (or listened to the advice of Scott Evil), and even the CIA is helpless before the wisdom and power of Jax from Charming (having already easily conqured the ATF and DOJ, I suppose this is a logical progression...but what is next? The White House?). It has become a very lazy show, recycling years-old masturbatory character arcs and plot lines, and increasingly applying hard to accept fantastical resolutions. They went &#34;big&#34; several years ago and lost what was special about the show; the inherent drama in human relationships under extreme stress."
I can barley remember the plot. Not one redeeming quality that I can remember. Giving the choice I would not recommend this to any one.
"I love Glee, but I gotta say that Season Four of Glee was by far the weakest of the seasons. The storylines were not that great-the songs not too good and while I enjoyed Blake Jenner, I do not like some of the other new characters. It also depresses me that this is the last season that Corey Monteith is in, and also that it was not that great. Don't waste your time or money on this, most of the songs can be watched on youtube."
"What started out as a reasonably enjoyable show seems to have run it's course.  Season 4 attempts to continue the story-line with some of the original 20-something- aged characters moving on to bigger and better things in the Big Apple.  Meanwhile, back at the old Alma Mater, everything continues to run on the same old track.  27 year-old Heather Morris continues her role as dumb blond Heather Pierce with a bit more screen time. Even the original music seems to be less enjoyable than it was in the first seasons."
Too many show tunes for me.. at least I think they are show tunes because I don't recognize most of the music.
"Not a fan of Gere but this story wasn't too bad. Had some good twists on what could have been a rehashed, tired storyline. The language was way over the top though."
"The only thing worse than having to watch a movie you never really cared for to begin with is being forced to watch it again and then realizing you can't stand it. That's exactly what happened with first time director Nicholas Jarecki's ""Arbitrage."" Starring Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon, Brit Marling, and Tim Roth, ""Arbitrage"" is the story of a billionaire named Robert Miller (Gere). Robert is the manager of a hedge fund empire that is supposedly one of the most profitable in the business, but Robert altered his books and committed fraud. Even though he's covered his tracks, the fraud is still there. On Robert's 60th birthday, a deal that will tie up all the loose ends and keep Robert and his family very happy and wealthy is on the verge of being negotiated. But that's when things begin to get a bit more complicated in Robert's life and his lies begin to get the best of him.""Arbitrage"" was one of the first screeners sent out to critics during the awards season. The movie is getting a ton of buzz because of Richard Gere's performance, so it was thrown into the nearest movie playing device and watched as quickly as possible. Needless to say, it was a huge letdown and was passable at best. So many screeners are sent out to critics every year, but this was the first year that the majority of the pile was watched on this end. So after viewing 30 or 40 movies since its initial viewing, ""Arbitrage"" shows up on Blu-ray in the mail and since the specifics of the movie had become so blurred since the last viewing another one was in order. Its second viewing only makes the experience feel even more mundane.Robert Miller isn't exactly an upstanding citizen. Hell, he isn't even likeable. Robert Miller is only watching out for Robert Miller. He only does what benefits himself. He tries to make it seem like he's worried about his family, but he's honestly just obsessed with money and is afraid of tarnishing his reputation. Richard Gere's performance isn't bad, but it doesn't really deserve a ton of accolades either. He's a guy that's buried himself in his own grave who's now mimicking a cockroach who won't die while scurrying along and trying to find any escape route that he can. Gere mostly just seems to throw temper tantrums and has a few emotional outbursts, but is nothing special overall. He yells a lot, but his go-to method is yelling completely belittling things to whoever he's talking to before whispering that they should come sit next to him so he can show them something. This happens on at least three different occasions with two different individuals.The movie is also a total waste of Tim Roth. Going into this, you may think to yourself that maybe Roth will at least have some enjoyable scenes. That unfortunately isn't really the case. Det. Michael Bryer (Roth) is a cop who plays dirty without actually being a dirty cop, if that makes any sense. He pulls strings to do things that aren't by the book, but it's to put the ones who deserve to be behind bars where they belong. Roth mostly just acts tough without ever doing anything to back it up or possibly never really having the chance. The most enjoyable part of his performance is his handlebar mustache. Brit Marling and Susan Sarandon feel wasted as well, but the wound doesn't feel quite as deep. Marling portrays Robert's daughter Brooke who also works for him while Sarandon is Robert's wife. Marling's only real shining moment is a shouting match with her father in a public park, but the scene only makes you wonder why nobody is stopping or taking notice of the argument even though it gets extremely heated. Sarandon's highlight is acting too busy to talk to Tim Roth even though she doesn't really have much going on, but honestly anything feels like a step up for her after her appearance in ""That's My Boy.""""Arbitrage"" attempts to be this thrilling and compelling piece of cinema and it just isn't. There are several different storylines going on throughout the movie, but it all just feels very ho hum; you don't care about any of it. Robert tries to be portrayed in this light that he's a wolf in sheep's clothing, but he's more of a rat in a skin suit. You have no desire to see his story go one way or the other. Not to mention that he bleeds internally for like a week and barely acknowledges it after the first night. With all of the cheating, the lying, the backstabbing, and innocent people who are trying to turn their life around and yet are getting hurt because of Robert, ""Arbitrage"" is the story of one rich man's downward spiral where both sides lie to try to get what they want but both walk away empty handed. It all results in a standstill that is about as thrilling as a staring contest.Special features on the Blu-ray of the film include Commentary with Writer/Director Nicholas Jarecki, the 12.5 minute ""A Glimpse into Arbitrage"" featurette which features the cast and crew discussing the film, the 7 minute ""Who is Robert Miller?"" featurette, and 10 minutes of Deleted Scenes with Optional Director Commentary."
"I really like Richard Gere but I think that this movies is quite below his ability. The movement and themes of this film have been used time and time again so that the viewer knows what will happen which leads to a boring repetitive theme seen in so many other movies. Originality is missing in today's hollywood productions. ,"
"It's about people living lies in order to succeed, even though it does not bring them happiness.  There are better ways to live, and I'd rather learn about those."
"Typically, I love Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon. I had high hopes and sadly, this movie just didn't do it for me. I felt the plot was a bit weak and obvious / dull / been done enough already... The supporting actors were just so so. I wish SS had a larger role, I don't enjoy Tim Roth or Monica Raymund, so was disappointed to find they were part of the cast. Thankfully MR didn't have a large part. I watched while doing some hemming, so at least my time wasn't wasted."
"Something misled me into expecting a smart white collar crime story, say like Margin Call with Spacey, Irons a.o.This one isn't it. Nothing wrong with the cast, Gere and Sarandon a.o. do their job, but the plot is, frankly, just yellow press pulp.American billionaire in his 60s runs into headwind on two fronts at once. His risky investment in Russia faces obstacles, which he tries to hide by cooking the books, so that he can sell his company just in time. His private life is upset by an accident: driving at night, he falls asleep, and his girl friend dies. He tries to hide his involvement from the police, and that becomes a race of time in the course of his company sale. His wife knows about it all, as wives do, and blackmails him. His daughter, who works with him, finds out about his con games and threatens him... That seems to be all the pressure a man needs in life.That should make a good suspense possible, if not a very original case, but the movie fails to interest me. I also see a serious flaw in the plot line: how can the man, Gere's billionaire, expect to sell the company and not be caught afterwards for the faked numbers?"
"Intended as an indictment of the one-percenters, but falling completely flat due to a lifeless script that has been done more times than Pamela Anderson has been mounted.Always affable Richard Gere plays Robert Miller, investment fund guru and billionaire. A power player on The Street with the grandiose nickname of 'The Oracle', given in response to his ability to forecast trends and seeing opportunities that the average manager did not. A man who is respected by his peers, adored by his investors, and loved by his family. He has it all. And as we get past the glossy introduction scenes, the dark and ugly revelations are quick and decidedly unremarkable.Unsurprisingly, Bob is a lying philanderer abusing the love of a good wife; a corrupt businessman who has manipulated and leveraged his company's assets into a wholly illegal and monstrously devastating position. And a self-absorbed narcissist who, when pushed, reveals his twisted inner essence. In a nutshell - evil dressed in a power suit and handsome frame.Yes, we get it. The one-percenters are moral frauds and ethical failures.Not a particular fresh revelation.And based on the brief revolting experiences I had scoping out various published society pages of Gotham, Malibu, Bean Town and the Potomac palaces - almost certainly an accurate portrait of most of the upper echelon and their stunning disconnect from us, the remaining 99%. Only $2 million dollars indeed.But an entire film restating the obvious isn't particularly creative or enjoyable.A production made worse with the stunningly linear role of the oh-so-tragic figure of Mrs. Ellen Miller, played by Susan Sarandon. Ah yes, she of the steadfast homefront, withstanding her partner's past indiscretions, supporting his weakness - loving the man for all his foibles and shortcomings until finally discovering who she had really married. And in a final&eacute; worthy of a Lifetime Channel flick - a karmic resetting of the scales by delivering societal goodness under a false banner of generosity. Cut to the award scene where she delivers slow perfunctory claps from a sitting position while everyone else is standing and cheering in admiration.Depressingly predictable.The sole presence that I found even mildly engaging was Stuart Margolin as Miller's personal attorney. I have very fond memories of the character actor as the persecuted neurotic goof from a multitude of comedies during the 70's and 80's. Screening him some forty years later as a calculating thousand-dollar-an-hour legal eagle was surprisingly enjoyable. But noting his wonderful performance was like noting a sweet cherry on top of a bored moose's steaming dung pile.I would love to say that there was something here worth spending entertainment funds or precious time out of one's life - but after thirty or so minutes I started to press the FF every few frames; skipping over ground that, quite frankly, started to put me to sleep. Literally.Destined for the OWN Channel's rotation.Movie Note:- In all honesty, to get a better sense of these people and their lives, I would strongly suggest watching ""Margin Call"" from 2011."
"Richard Gere is the best part of this film. In it he plays a billionaire who stands to lose everything because of a bad deal with a copper mine and so the lies come out as things go from bad to worse.Unfortunately most of the plot points were overly predictable but fortunately the performances were delivered better.Susan Sarandon plays the wife of Gere and you can tell early on that the couple is  disconnected one. Also starring Tim Roth as a police detective.A message of rich people getting away with it but it lacked any depth or twist or anything remotely interesting enough to push it above average. Also, you had Gere and Sarandon and that was the best you could do with them?The budget for this picture was not listed (always suspicious and likely that means a loss) and it made a bit over $22M at the Box Office.STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C to C plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus; SOUND/MUSIC: B minus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B minus; MORALITY FOCUSES/MESSAGE: C to C plus; OVERALL GRADE: C plus; WHEN WATCHED: early January 2013."
"This was not a good role for Richard Gere.  He has made movies I have enjoyed. ""Unfaithful"" for example. Mr. Gere just wasn't believable as a tough arbitrager.  The plot was about as exciting as watching paint dry. I fell asleep twice, the car crash woke me up once. The second time was when my dog wanted to go outside.  I gave it 2 stars for the scenery."
"Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon, what could go wrong?  The ending, that's what. Folks could rate this movie 1-5 stars based on their likes, interests, their taste in ""film"", blah, blah, blah.  It held my attention, it was mildly tense throughout the movie, but the end feels like rape.  Rape of my time and attention.  Only one time in my life have I taken note of a director... that was M. Night Shyamalan.  Sixth Sense was amazing and all my years of critiques, editing, writing, and reading, that one movie was one that caught me entirely unprepared, but satisfied.  But then, his constant and consistent failure since has convinced me to avoid anything he participates in.  Now, for the second time in my long life, a director has caught my attention. Nicholas Jarecki for Arbitrage.  Should his name ever come to my attention again I will avoid the product related to him.  All my life I've studied writing, editing, entertaining in creative forms as a matter of a love for it. Stephen King, very well loved, doesn't cross my desk after years of horrible ""non"" endings.  I'm inclined to writers like Dean Koontz and J. Michael Straczynski... people who appreciate their audiences and don't play idiocy with them. They have the guts to write a climax that leads to a sensible conclusion that satisfies the consumer.  If you think ""Highly praised"" aka ""art"" or ""artistic"" is ""just wonderful"", then waste your life watching movies like this one. Better still, find a foreign film where you can read the closed captions and miss the acting for your entertainment... personally, I would prefer a book if I have to read. You have to take this review based on its title, Instant Review... I rarely get upset unless my valuable time is infringed upon.  If you don't mind being moderately entertained for around 100 minutes and then going to the bathroom and missing the whole climax and conclusion, you'll like this film.  I can't give zero stars, one star would insult the 95 or so minutes of great acting and tension you'd expect from 'drama'. So two stars with the warning, 100 minutes are YOUR minutes and you deserve to enjoy all of those minute, not 95% of them."
"I love Gere in almost everything he has ever done, this would be my exception.I found this movie very confusing and boring.  There is too much going on and too many sub-plots.Tim Roth was annoying as the dogged detective.My favorite character is the young black man, played by Nate Parker,  who helps Gere; he had the only part I believed.Susan Sarandon was almost invisible; if she spoke 10 lines throughout that was a lot.  And she's such a good actress.Brit Marling, playing the daughter, was an Ivanka Trump wannabe without the intelligence, beauty and sense of style and humor.  Bad choice.I would be astounded if Gere got an Oscar nom for this as people who are interviewing him are all saying.  He seems humble and probably knowsbest that this was no stellar performance of his.Don't waste your money, as I did."
This film is a big waste of talent.  Richard Gere at 60 still is charming and has a great hair cut.  Poor Susan Sarandon didn't do so well.  Somehow they managed to make her look fat and unattractive.  The others are uninteresting.  Some attractive but boring blond girl plays their daughter.  You'd think a child of theirs would have some personality but no.  There's a detective who does a bad Columbo impersonation.  I'm ashamed that I sat through the whole thing.  I kept watching just to see how the guy's troubles would end up and then....it was over!  What happened to him?  Frankly I didn't care much.
"This is a very watchable film and it held my interest throughout.  Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon and the rest of the excellent supporting cast are what makes this film go.  This is a financial thriller right out of today's headlines.  Richard Gere is a financial magnate who has made a large and unwise investment that has threatened to take his firm down.  He is groping for a financial lifeline, and therein lies this interesting story.  This is a thinking-person's film, but it tells the story very well.The problem with the film in my opinion is the unsympathetic nature of most of the characters.  Gere comes across as an unlikable hypocrite and his wife is no better.  The rest of the characters are swept up in Gere's amoral and immoral schemes, and somehow mostly come across as unsympathetic saps.  Well, that was my take on it; yours may be different.  Despite this flaw, this is an entertaining film that is worth watching.  RJB."
"(SPOILERS) Feel as if I've seen a variation of this character so many times in film, super rich, caucasian, male, and still do not understand him...perhaps I never will.  Loved the actors, but the story...nothing new, why tell it.  Not to rag on the filmmakers, in the commentary the gentleman explained it took him forever to be allowed to direct.  But why this story.  Does every well off male character of a certain age have to have a mistress 20-30 years his junior and be a scum bag (lying to wife, cheating investors), ugh.  Such an unflattering picture.  I still do not understand what made him tick.  Maybe I'd need to be male to understand what drives him; as a woman, I'm sorry to say, he makes no sense to me (I may just be too slow, honestly).  Basically, in my opinion, the character in this film is presented as a successful, powerful businessman, but it is also clearly shown in the story that he is a criminal just smart enough to manipulate the system (legal system, capitalist system), to stay a step ahead of the authorities.  How is living your life a lie equal to success.  To me, the character was a liar, a cheat, and a criminal; and as he chose to live his life the way he did, he seems stupid, not smart.  But almost all the characters surrounding him either ignore his shortcomings (his wife), or maybe most just don't see them.  His daughter seemed shocked by his revelation of criminal activity, as if she knew nothing about him - it's not believable that the characters closest to him would know so little about him - he's not suddenly behaving this way, he's been behaving this way for a long time.  How could his adult children not have a clue to who he is.  He's not a flawless liar - I think his kids were underwritten.  Had the writer/director presented the character in a way I could understand, I would give the movie 3 stars, but I am still as confused about this type of fictitious businessman as I've always been, so I gained no clarity from the film.  Also disliked the women characters; the wife character (played by Susan Sarandon, a great actress) displayed no power until the surprise ending, so her sudden power at the end is not set up properly; and I'm so tired of seeing stupid women characters as mistresses to some dog who strings them along - can't we have a gorgeous mistress dump some jerk and go to school to get her masters degree or Ph.D; and the daughter had no power in the story, just a title.  Basically the Richard Gere character disrespected all the women - how is that attractive to any woman viewer.  Anyway, disliked the character Mr. Gere played (liked his acting, of course), and just wanted more from the women characters.  Hope the writer/director will try again and do better.  Regarding the use of the N word in the story, as a middle-age African American woman, it indicates to me how disrespectful the film business treats minorities with less financial power - the film business has a lot of powerful Jewish people, I very rarely hear Jewish racial slurs in the movies I see, but I often hear the N word - racial slurs shouldn't be in film stories unless they are sprinkled throughout for all the races, which they never are.  Just a thought to the film maker for future projects.  Maybe he'll think about it.  For instance, whatever his ethnicity is, how would he feel viewing films that lobbed racial insults at his group, at his ancestors.  There are alot of different people in an audience - not just the people financing films, all races view them.  I think we need to move abit closer to the concept of world film, i.e., respecting all life and thinking long and hard before inserting insulting racial slurs in film.  Can't hurt and it may help."
Well-known cast with a story-line that was just average.  Did not really hold your interest in that most of the outcome was rather predictable.  Felt more like a TV movie.  Worth watching but just not outstanding.  Susan Sarandon's role was rather limited in scope.
"I was skeptical going into this movie. Nothing really good can come out of Susan Sarandon and Richard Gere when they want to ""denounce"" corporate greed. Everything was clich&eacute; in this movie. Down to the donation of 2 millions to a cancer research foundation, that will be used to make the doctors more rich and famous for nothing. They will use the funds to have ""meetings"" in exotic places in order to ""share the information"" (I haven't seen a scientific meeting downtown Detroit in a while). They will use the money to have big dinners and share big awards between them and patting themselves on the back. No drug that will cure a real disease will ever come out from these big donations and galas. In spite of this, people still believe that they are doing the right thing by donating money to these foundations. What a waste!The plot is somehow complicated and we are not getting a real answer because the movie just ends!  Robert Miller (Gere) is a hedge-fund magnate (immediately you think he is the bad evil guy who deserves to die!) who has manipulated the books because of a bad investment (where else, in Russia) that cost him 420 millions. He wants to unload his company for approximately the same amount of money to replace the money before somebody checks the books (I guess he thinks that somebody who spends this kind of money, will not check the books first for accuracy,...but that is another story). One night while driving with his mistress he falls asleep and gets into an accident. She dies and he tries to cover up.Taking lessons of ethics and behavior in life from Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon it is quite amazing. I knew immediately even before the movie started that their goal was to denounce corporate greed and arrogant behavior. They didn't succeed in their goal since his mistress is not portrayed as a great person and we don't know much about her, just that she is of French origin. His wife is a cold selfish person that nobody should care about, and he is not greedy, he is just trying to cover for a mistake. They didn't want to make a real thriller or a mystery movie. They could have taken that route. That would have been a much better film. But they decided to make a (bad) propaganda movie. Just another complaint about people with money.  But wait: aren't they also arrogant millionaires that give their money to hedge-fund managers to make more money? And when I watched the extras I saw a patronizing Sarandon and a serious Gere lecturing us about the problems of the world and what is ethical or not.  What a bunch of pretentious hypocrites!Richard Gere performance is the same as in ""Pretty Woman"" or ""an Officer and a Gentleman"". Average, nothing special. When I heard rumors of him going for the Oscars this year against Daniel-Day Lewis in ""Lincoln"" it made me vomit. This film was already nominated for the Golden Globe which is a prelude to the Oscars. The only reason they will give him an award for this pathetic performance in this pathetic movie, is because everything is rigged in Hollywood and they want to promote their anti-Wall Street propaganda. Really don't understand why the Hollywood people will bite the hand that feeds them. I don't think that the average Joe buys their propaganda: ""white collar corruption"", ""corporate greed"", ""fair share...fair share""...blah, blah, blah. These are clich&eacute; sentences that only minimum educated people (...like the occupy Wall Street moronic crowd) believe. This is totally illogical. Nothing in this film deserves even the mention of an award. And please people, get Susan Sarandon some decent clothes. She was dressed with rags like a homeless person throughout the movie. In contrast, Brit Marling was very classy (we can tell that she already worked on Wall Street) but Susan Sarandon...was really very casual (to say the least) for a hedge-fund magnate wife.The only bright moments in this movie are the performances of Jimmy (Nate Parker) and of Detective Bryar (Tim Roth). Great acting and really great presence. But still, trying to manipulate a picture and make up a poorly pixilated license plate was really cheap and sad. Anybody can do much better these days with a computer!Two stars only for Nate Parker's performance that really saves the film from the abyss where it really belongs together with the entire pathetic script."
"I like ""Bones"". I watch it on Amazon since I don't have cable. The characters are great and i like the way they interact and even when a show story might be weak I just enjoy the conversations. The actors do a great job of portraying their characters. So why did I give this weeks show a 2? Mainly because Hodgens unequivocally states that 911 was not a conspiracy. There is no way if Hodgens really existed that he wouldn't at least keep his mind open. This is a political statement that the viewers are supposed to gobble up. Nobody wants to believe the truth."
"I'd hoped that in addition to interviews with knuckleball pitchers, the DVD would also show pitches in slow-motion, from angles that allowed one to clearly see how the ball behaves on the way to the plate. Also some description of the physics involved, and an explanation of why there are so few knuckleball pitchers. Didn't happen."
"Let me clarify this from the get-go: I'm not one of those reviewers who seeks to kick the stuffing out of `found footage' films.  All you need to do is peruse the reviews I've done here at Amazon or elsewhere to know that I'm entirely accepting of this sub-genre.  I'd go so far to say that I enjoy them quite a bit so long as there is some quality story, development, and characters at the heart of whatever footage the producers allege to have found.  Granted, I do believe these flicks work best as horror upstarts, but that doesn't mean I won't appreciate a few dramatic turns here and there, and, to its credit, HOLLOW thinks it knows what it's doing in presenting four young folks - two couples, basically - enjoying a weekend outing in some romantic and spooky setting.  Unfortunately, HOLLOW should've known better.(NOTE: The following review may contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of characters and plot.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)There's a tree on a hill in the middle of a small remote village that - rumor had it - has been haunted by a local legend ... for, in the hollow of this massive, somewhat disfiguring tree, there lives a dark spirit that seeks out young lovers in the midst of some relationship strife and convinces them to commit suicide.Now, if you stop right there, I'd argue you have the makings of a possibly mystical thriller.  You have all the right elements - an evil place, an evil spirit, and an evil cause - that coulda, woulda, shoulda made for a nice picture.Unfortunately, then they made the film.Emma , a/k/a `the innocent one' (played by the lovely Emily Plumtree), and Scott, a/k/a `the alpha male' (Matt Stokoe), long for a weekend away from it all; and, hoping to share it with a few friends, they invite James, a/k/a `the jilted ex with a troubled past'(Sam Stockman), and Lynne, a/k/a `the slutty one' (Jessica Ellerby), to join them.  Emma's grandfather - the pastor for a small, country village - recently passed away, and they're heading there to make use of the premises, despite the fact that it has no electricity.  Once there, they find themselves all equally creeped out by the legendary tree of local lore, and, before their weekend getaway is over, they may find out just how real and deadly folklore can be.Some `found footage films' clearly give `found footage films' a bad name, and HOLLOW is part of that growing group of flicks made clearly to capitalize on a sub-genre but not provided enough spine upon which to build a perfect body.  In fact, all there is to HOLLOW is its twist ending - not all that big of a twist, and certainly one you can see coming from ten miles away.  These characters aren't given any legitimate depth - though I've read some reviewers who think the introduction of relationships and faithlessness accounts to `character development' (here's a tip: it doesn't) - and, instead, they're all archetypes plopped into a `locked box scenario' with very little hope of escaping.In that respect, much of HOLLOW works just fine.  There's a benign charm to some elements of the film - the introduction of the local church mythology surrounding the suicide tree, the fact that there exists more than ample evidence to support some paranormal phenomenon in the vicinity, etc. - that work well enough to establish the premise; however, when writer/director Matthew Holt essentially delivers an ending an audience knew from their very first frame, why bother at all?  Why not, instead, give viewers a legitimate reason to hang around for 90 minutes by creating characters that mean something more than just fitting the stereotype?  These are four relatively self-centered and stupid individuals who one could argue get just what they deserved for being so mind-numbingly self-centered and stupid.  Don't be shocked when they get their comeuppance.Sadly, a sense of `nothing new here' pervades so much of HOLLOW.HOLLOW is produced by (how fitting?) Hollow Pictures.  DVD distribution is being handled through New Video.  As for the technical specifications ... well ... the video looks and sounds about as good as the next `found footage' flick, though I'm alarmed by the increasing use of a camera at night when the characters are running while essentially filming the ground.  Sound is good, but the herky-jerky camera work really could've been improved.  Also, there's an awful lot of turning-the-camera-off (to save battery near the end), but, boy, it's sure good that they turned the camera on just as something was about to happen!  (Don't give me that gobbledy-gook about them ""needing the light,""either.  I didn't just fall off a truck.)  As for the special features, there's only a two-minute ""story behind the scene"" wherein the director gives you his two cents about how and why they shot the ending the way they did; it's interesting, but it ain't all that special, nor much of a feature.RECOMMENDED only if found footage films are REALLY your thing because, otherwise, I'd be hard-pressed to see what value one might find in HOLLOW.  It isn't that it's poorly made because, in most instances, the production quality is there.  While I wouldn't agree with some stylistic choices made, I strongly disagree with those who think there's a winning 90-minute story here because there isn't.  At best, it's a half-hour Twilight Zone episode stretched out into 90 unnecessary minutes.  Once you experience the ""engrossing and effective"" ending (their advertising words, certainly not mine), perhaps you'll agree.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at New Video provided me with a DVD screener copy of HOLLOW for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
"The &#34;found footage&#34; approach worked as a novelty in The Blair Witch Project.  Once was enough.  This one appears to imitate that style.  We could not enjoy the shaky amateur photography used in such films.  For that reason, we watched only ten or fifteen minutes of this one before moving on to something else.  In fairness, it may have had some good points, but we did not stay to find them."
"Utilizing the increasingly popular ""found footage"" genre that combines elements of the thriller into a faux documentary presentation, ""Hollow"" takes a rather slight story and serves up exactly what you might expect. It seems like many absolutely loathed ""Hollow,"" but I think some of those people were expecting a full-on horror show. There is some creepiness, but this presentation doesn't show you much of anything that will actually scare you. It tries to get you to jump at jarring noises, that's the extent of its thrills. Neither particularly good or bad, this is a film with limited ambition or originality. I watched this with a friend, and when the movie ended--he turned to me and said ""well, that was just what I thought it would be."" It's not that either of us hated the film--far from it--we simply thought it lacked any real element of surprise. It's reasonably well made and the actors are appealing enough. It just lacks impact from a plotting standpoint. You've seen it all before and oftentimes better.Four friends venture to the countryside to a family estate for a weekend. Set in Suffolk, England, the house borders a creepy monastery with a history of driving local youths to suicide. The friends, comprised of two couples, make the best of things with no electricity and increasingly mysterious goings-on. As usual, it doesn't occur to anyone to leave until things have progressed too far. As an extra annoyance, they decide to film absolutely everything. Yes, this is one of those movies! Someone is always holding a camera! Tension, and even madness, starts to infiltrate the group. Can they work against a curse? Can they survive a murderer? Can they stay united? Just what is out there in the hollow? And for goodness sake, that's the best darn camera battery I've ever seen! If you want complex mythology to explain the nightmare, it's never really developed in any depth.For all that, though, ""Hollow"" is surprisingly well acted. What the screenplay lacks in horror, it makes up with some actual character development. The primary quartet are all quite believable. Emily Plumtree, Sam Stockman, Matt Stokoe, and Jessica Ellerby play the four leads. As the stress of the weekend starts to divide them, each turns in a performance that was more convincing that I had anticipated. Seriously, I think they all have the potential to go on to bigger projects. As much as I want to recommend ""Hollow"" for this reason, though, I'm still unable. The back story is both derivative and only vaguely explored. And in a movie that is trying to ratchet up the tension, this is a fatal mistake. I'd personally be happy if I never saw another ""found footage"" thriller. Too often, the genre lends itself to sloppy storytelling. Performances at 4 stars, plot at 2 stars, scares at 1 1/2 stars. The DVD/Blu-ray packaging might convince you that this is a horror story, but it's really a piece about relationships under duress. KGHarris, 2/13."
The concept of the show...that the doctor has to compromise her principles by doing jobs for the mob to protect her brother just didn't work.  I can't imagine week after week is not my cup of tea.
"Uh ... the ""stuff"" is not moving along very fast .... I am getting a little bored at all these stalling tactics, get on with it."
"This episode, stay, is the worst in an at best mediocre series. It is so stupid that the actors seem on the verge of laughing when they say their lines."
"The production is beautiful, and the acting is excellent, but the story simply plays out a series of cliches that never add up to make a plot, and by the end, when you realize it was exactly what you both expected it to be and hoped it would not be, this albeit well-made short falls flat."
"For the first time in a long time, saw and episode that I regretted paying for.  And that is a bad thing.  I gonna stick with this series for a while, but it's just not as layered and complex as it used to be.The brilliance of this show is its ability to address &#34;virtue&#34; on a very physical level.  I think they have of lost their way in this manner."
"Getting into mid-flight, then crashing again. That was season 3.So after the fascinatingly terrible second season we kick off the third season with a bang, the doofi haven't come up with a plan or anything but they're wandering aimlessly getting by when they find the prison and plan to make that their home due to it's impenetrable walls. The first half of season 3 is, actually pretty damn enjoyable! Rick's team scrambling to get their s*** together was pretty entertaining while Andrea's encounter with the Governor was pretty interesting. Unlike the second season where the actors sat around a farm and waited for their knuckle-dragging fanboys to shower them with money and praise, this season interesting things actually happen and the 7th Heaven conversations are vastly minimized to bare necessity.Rick's group was the most entertaining part of the show. A few major characters are unexpectedly killed off in gruesome ways and after one problem is dealt with another pops up. I guess it's because we're familiar with these people now that they all have a place in the situation instead of sitting around bored. The acting is still hammy and forced, especially by Rick who does the worst American accent I've seen in awhile. Apparently American's grunt all the time. His descent into madness though was nicely done. Carl also steps his game up this season, instead of annoying his parents and me, he has hardened into the situation and his actor doesn't play it cutesy or whatever. Short Round also steps his game up when he sees Rick going crazy, so it was nice seeing some development with these characters, lord knows it was long overdue but at least it's finally here.Then we got the other storyline with the Governor, and it was pretty interesting when you're first introduced to Woodbury. However a few episodes in this supposed badass Governor seemed to enjoy nothing more then sitting around drinking with Andrea and discussing their feelings, I wouldn't be too surprised if there's a scene they left on the cutting floor with both of them reading Cosmopolitan too. His arc is slow and boring, which was a bad call considering the producers want him to be a memorable villain. Basically after his eye's taken out he becomes a surly douche who is hellbent on destroying Rick and his gang for flimsy reasons, then the last scene you see him in he finally snaps into what we've been hinted at for an entire season.Andrea is also boring with her token black friend, I got little to no impression that they're friends, instead they seemed more like survivor acquaintances who at the first sign of shelter start snapping and b***hing at each other like rabid hyenas. Her arc was interesting regarding that she's one of the main characters in the comic who's still around. In the show, she goes to Woodbury, sleeps with the governor, wonders if he has some screws loose when she finds his human heads collection, tries to resolve the tensions between groups, then gets killed. Wow. I mean, half the season was dedicated to this sole character who slowly pieces together for 12 episodes ""governor... BAD!"", and then abruptly dies. I mean the surprise was nice but what a waste of time that ends up being watching this expendable character sit around, drink, and wonder if something's wrong.Michonne, like a malignant tumor, grew on me. At first she just glared at everyone/everything and clutch onto her unbreakable katana afraid everyone will take it. However once I got endless vapid dialogue with the other characters comparing periods her silence became welcoming to me, and I ended up liking her by the end of the season. Merle also comes back this season, but he basically just plays governor's lackey until he's betrayed, then turns into angsty jerk that no one likes. Like Michonne however, he was pretty straight-forward and not too talky which worked fine for me, also Michael Rooker is a great actor so he brought some dimension to Merle's character.So after the midseason finale when the governor's pissed off and Rick's going crazier, the show kind of just stops. They could've excluded the last couple of episodes and still worked. Instead we got many filler episodes, such as Rick running into the black dude from the first episode, and Andrea getting chased by the governor for an entire episode. Why did they even do that? Why did they bloat out a solid first half into more nothing? Why do the Walking Dead writers hold so much contempt for their fans? Why not end this season 12 episodes in or something, keep it lean and solid, or go the extra mile and give the season a clear resolution with the governor/rick's conflict, and make season 3 a knock-out? Oh yeah, because AMC doesn't care about quality.So season 3 definitely picks up from the soggy turd that was season 2 (really though there was no where to go but up), but flails and crashes after the halfway mark into another bafflingly mishandled season of the walking dead. It looks like the production team blew their entire budget on the first half then slapped a few filler episodes together centered around one character, and called it a day. So instead of this being a solid good season, it's a few good episodes, followed by nothing, followed by a giant middle finger, followed by credits. Really though, they promised for the finale 27 deaths, then it turns out that almost all of them were unimportant stock characters shot off screen. I'll give the writers this, they're intune with their fans pleads for mercy. They hated Lori, she died. They hated Andrea, she died.So all in all it concludes into a mildly diverting tv show, but it's never really scary, exciting, or engaging. The zombie apocalypse is still poorly shown and instead of a grittier more realistic survivalism story we still see characters sit around not doing too much. The gun handling in this is still laughably bad and the pacing gets progressively more sluggish as the season shambles along. Really though I've long given up higher expectations for this show, the fact that thousands of fans showered this season with praise before they even finished it (finale date - 3/31/13) shows that TWD fans are, still, gullible morons who see nothing wrong with paying $40 for another half assed season.P.S. Nice 5 star reviews that are 2 vague sentences of praise written by many people who have only reviewed The Walking Dead Season 3. F***ing viral marketing, how does that work?"
"I have to admit when I first started watching this show I was prepared to dislike it intensely. I'm not a huge zombie fan to begin with, too much grossness what with falling body parts and their predeliction to snacking on the living plus the screaming just doesn't usually make for the kind of entertainment I enjoy. But the Walking Dead Season 1 charmed me enough with it's believable, intriguing characters and end of the world as we know it depiction to get into watching it. And I found myself enjoying it immensely even though I had to hold a pillow in my lap to block out the more squeem-inducing moments. (If you've seen the show you know what I'm talking about)Season 2 was equally great, more so since now we knew the characters enough to care about their fates and/or even be annoyed by some while growing to love others. WARNING: SPOILER ALERT HERE - But then when Shane died at the end of Season 2 I thought, ""Uh-oh, am I going to even like Season 3?"" Granted while Shane wasn't the greatest humanitarian he was THE main source of the internal conflict amongst the group. It made watching the series so worth it for me since I was by turns fascinated, frightened and even sometimes sympathetic of his hoped for role as savior and hero being upstaged repeatedly by his best friend, Rick. It's enough to drive a man mad and sure enough that's what happened to Shane and then Rick, every the shining hero put an end to Shane's life. And sadly the best source of internal conflict on the show too. This left me wondering what Season 3 would bring. I heard about Michonne and that seemed like a good thing. A kickbutt woman with a katana? How cool will that be, right?And then Season 3 arrived and with it my feelings of growing...boredom. Sadly Michonne's character is taking forever to develop and sorry, but having the actress run around looking angry all the time while not saying much does not endear her to me. I know Michonne's a strong, silent warrior type, but I don't know why since she's just not been given the time and attention her character needs to take it's place in the overall story. The Governor is also boring since again we know he's a bad guy who seems charming on the surface, but not really why outside of the usual cliched ""former nobody finds himself in power and aims to keep it that way no matter who he has to mow down along the way"" villian. And the survivors themselves haven't really gained much in the way of new developments either. All of this leads to a not very compelling story to watch and maybe it's just me, but I find myself having to use the pillow in my lap alot more this season. Even in places where I don't think we should have to like did we really have to see Hershel's foot getting cut off? That coupled with the fact that things just keep getting worse and worse and worse and there's no real reason to care or goal to be had makes me feel that this story is simply another one of the walking dead, shuffling along with a blank stare on its collective face. And I'm so jaded by this point I just dance out of the zombie's way a little bit then don't even bother with the head shot since it really just isn't anything I'm interested in dealing with now. For me anyways, this show is dead."
"Remember the scene where Carl got shot? Remember when Rick turned that corner on the horse in the city? Remember the CDC, the interstate when the herd came through.....any scene that Shane was in?This is no longer that show. If all they've got is a guy mowing down a crowd with a gun then screw them. Even the Merle situation seemed rushed and contrived.The dynamics that Shane and Dale brought - gone. The interesting path Andrea was on - gone. Now she's a g-stringed girlfriend - oh wait now she's dead too. Merle's great presence and the potential for his character - gone. They brought the cool black guy with the dramatic British theatrical training and the greatest southern accent ever from the first season back just so you could watch him quickly disappear into useless madness and find out that his awesome kid died.All that remains is a lukewarm crowd of people waiting for Rick to give orders - even Daryl - with some moodiness and bitchiness occurring throughout from what's left of the uninteresting group.The governor - the actor totally unconvincing.All my favorite characters are dead - no longer anticipated the next episode. It's a dead show as far as I'm concerned."
"The same old same old, another cop show with a so-called best selling author sidekick. This kind of show has been done to death. ANOTHER cop show? Adding a writer of fiction cop books to the same old same old mix is something new?It was cute for the first season, all that sexual tension between them, but now that's over and now the show is slowly dying. It won't see another season."
"Really loved Castle when it had a layered storyline (Beckett's mother, the serial killer, etc) and when it had connectedness with characters.  This season has lost the magic.  It's episodic, contrived and tired.  The character chemistry is gone as we see little of Alexis and Castle's mother and the relationship with Beckett and Castle lacks substance.  The one-liners and stories are mostly predictable and the season finale was anti-climatic.  And what's with the cameo appearance of Beckett's Dad?  We never see the guy and suddenly we are supposed to connect with a moment when she is at a crossroads and meets him for coffee for advice? Blah. Wishing they would have tied it up neatly a season ago as I'm finding that I don't really care what happens now."
"Maybe with time the actors will become comfortable with their characters and stop over-acting them.  Denis Quaid scowls and growls even when he smiles.  I get it, you are a miserable rancher forced into being a miserable sheriff.Chiklis isn't very imposing as a chicago goon in the desert.  Full face camera shots of his expressionless face don't frighten anyone.  OH....a miserable Havana casino manager now a miserable Vegas casino manager!The actor who plays Dix needs to decide what voice he is going to use all the time.....he sounds like Rich Little doing Denis Quaid....or a whining kid.  Pick one, please.The brother of the sheriff could disappear and noone would notice.  He and the casino chick will finally get it one when Frank and Dean come back."
"This series has a very exciting concept, but lacks the acting skill to pull it off. Dennis Quaid hasn't got the personality to project a simple man of integrity, the land, traditions, etc. His whole demeanor, and his acting forte, just breathes &#34;complicated&#34;, hinting at mysterious depths and quirks. He should stick to roles that play on his strengths. Not to paint him into a stereotype, but he makes a great trickster, hood, playboy, bad boy. Clint Eastwood he is not. John Wayne he is not. Tom Selleck he is not. Serious miscasting here. Too bad."
"My kids used to remark about an old joke that it was old when the dinosaurs roamed the earth. This formula about an aggressive, honest, opinionated sheriff taking on a saloon-keeper in the wild and wooly American West is far from original.  It is not well acted, directed or conceived.  I expected much better from the cast.  One cultural stereotype after another with many murders, jurisdiction challenges, and righteous indignation.  How much a relief it would be if life were like that...."
"This show could have been so much better, but since they had to get the characters sooo involved with so many other things, it really took away from the main theme of the show. You should have let Michael Chiklis be a mean and nasty hamster too."
"I really wanted this to be a 5 star series but its not. I like both the main actors and had high expectations but have been disappointed at the &#34;tough cowboy&#34; &#34;though mob guy&#34; wooden acting. The set for outside the casino is so bad, even today the Fremont street area is not that shiny!If you want to watch a really good series about Vegas in the 60's watch Crime Story&#8230;..better acting, better sets, better cars & way better music. The series starts in Chicago but moves to Las Vegas after the first 2 seasons."
"Riley Keough and Juno Temple star in Jack & Diane which is basically a love story between two young women and disguised as a warewolf story as well. But the whole warewolf storyline was pretty much vacant and nothing, and I mean NOTHING happens in this movie. The writer/director couldn't create a full and compelling story, the writing is flat, the acting is only really good from Juno Temple, and the direction is sloppy. And the way Riley Keough looks in this movie is like a young Elvis Presley which is I'm sure intentional since that is her grandfather for crying out loud! I just didn't believe the relationship between Jack & Diane, they fall in love way too quickly and I can't figure out why they do? This movie is pointless and I'm only giving it 2 stars (way too generous, I know) because of Temple's performance."
"Although I've yet to see the concluding chapter of ""Twilight,"" I can't image it would be any worse than this mess.  Here we have 2 teen age girls, both with issues who meet, get friendly then bleed, vomit and cough up teeth on each other.  I'm not sure if director Bradley Rust Gray was trying to make a horror film, but the film is horrible.The horror element comes in often as Diane (Juno Temple, ""The Dark Knight Rises"") who also has an identical twin, has nightmares (which we get to enjoy) of some sort of monster (werewolf?)  I couldn't quite figure it out.  We see this growth of long hair, blood, teeth and internal organs mixed into the visuals.  It never makes sense as to what it is or why she has the dreams.Diane also seems like the needy, fair-weather lesbian, just there for the moment, whereas Jack (Riley Keogh, ""Magic Mike"") is the real deal.  Butch in all ways.  That's about it.  Just 110 minutes with two sour-faced unlikeable young women.  Not funny, not sexy, not interesting, not emotional, not educational.  I needed a shower after I watched it...the warm kind.The Blu ray transfer comes with a 1080p resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  Shot in 35 mm film, it looks very good on Blu ray.  Film grain remains and clarity is good for the most part.  Skin tones are spot on as are most of the colors.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  The film is dialog centric so the surrounds don't come into play often.  Sometimes with ambient noise but rear channels come alive with the nice soundtrack.  Extras include a 10 minute doc about the special effects, an AXS-TV promo, a trailer and other Magnolia features."
"This is the worst season of the series.  The first few seasons had me laughing so hard.  But this season, everything seems so forced.  Penny seems to be more of a miserable lush than previous seasons.  The exchanges between Howard and Bernadette are so dull at times.  I don't know what the heck Raj is doing, but watching a full show stacked with tidbits of a texting date ended up putting me to sleep.  However, I see the progression of Sheldon's character with Amy as an interesting story line and see this as taking center stage instead of the Howard and Bernadette snoozefest and the painful Leonard and Lush Amy storylines soon.  I wish there was not so much angst in those relationships.  It would be funny to see Howard and Bernadette and Leonard and Penny in a competition to see who is the most passionate or romantic couple only to have Sheldon try to join in the competition out of pure competitiveness where he suffers a kiss from Amy for the sake of the cause and make Raj the black horse out of nowhere!"
"For all that Sherlock Holmes-type characters are lauded for their deductive abilities, what they're usually doing is induction, not deduction. Induction is the type of reasoning that goes from the specific to the general, e.g., he has blood on his sleeve therefore he is the murderer. This sort of reasoning is very unreliable and even the smartest people are wrong more than they're right. This means that Holmes and his ilk are fundamentally impossible characters, although Doyle's original is shown as less miraculous than most of the current iterations. The conclusions drawn by the character in this show are absurd."
Too boring for words...the whole thing fell flat from beginning to end and I amazed I even got to the end or did I? Forgettable to say the least.
"If you like this show, you must not have read Arthur Conan Doyle's books, or watched the old Basil Rathbone movies--which I recommend.  I thought this series might be good because it has Lucy Lui.  It is just another cop show with a smart cerebral main character.  He is just too clever for words.  The characters are nothing like Watson and Holmes. Holmes would never try to burn his violin.  I would rather watch reruns of Monk.  He has his problems, but he is not rude and nasty. Does this Holmes ever take a shower, he looks so grungy!"
"i really wanted to like this show, and it is just ok. I think they are trying to hard to make sherlock like a bad@ss hipster guy, and really the main thing i like about the show is Lucy Lu"
"How sad. They turned Fringe into a dull invader story. Gone are the fantastic events that required the quirky team of Olivia, Walter, and Peter to make some incredible discovery. Walter is no longer the lovable damaged person he was, and that was 80% of the draw of the series. I had pre-purchased a season pass but I am now canceling it. For me the series is already over."
"Hey, guys, I love this show, but I'm PAYING for it so I won't have to watch your stupid ads. FOX, you've seriously screwed up, in this viewers opinion. Bad. Bad enough that I WILL NOT be spending money for this show again if it has ads."
There should have never been a second season as far as I am concerned. Season one should have ended with and they lived happily everafter just like the fairy tale.
"To go along with all this cheesy acting.I didn't think the first season was all that great but I thought it had potential and would pickup so I watched it to the end. I have seen every single last episode of this series to date and I'm not sure Why I gave it the benefit of the doubt. It goes from ""Okay,to Interesting, to Good, to Terrible, to Great, to Completely Awful"" and that seems to be the episode cycle with this series. The balance of story writing and acting ability is never consistent with this show. Sometimes there's a really good episode and then one that is a complete flop. It's as though each episode has a different writer like this is a series of short stories all by different authors. Some time you hate you missed the show and sometimes you wish you didn't waste your time to watch it all. Then complied into that is the acting, and how bad it is. There are maybe but a handful of ""good"" actors on this show and they are all Villians. With the exception of Mulan just about everyone else makes you want to cringe at the way they deliver their lines. It's as though Uwe Boll is directing this show. The acting is completely all over the place.For starters Seeing less Henry and more story started to make this show seem more promising and then came season 2. Not only is Henry all over the place but as usual he is the most annoying character on the show. I get it this kids supposed to be a key character but his acting is awful in every scene which makes watching him just make you shake your head and hope the scene ends soon. Whether the writers have him doing some stupid and pointless idea or if he's just running around town nagging people with the same ""I want to help"", ""your a story book character"" it just gets old and quick. Why and I mean WHY would you give the worst actor on your show the most screen time? This kids acting makes Tommy Wiseau look like Kevin Costner! and I know ""he's just a kid"" yeah and a terrible actor. I wouldn't cared much or have said much if they didn't cram this kids in your face every 5 minutes into the show. No matter what the story is as soon as this kid appears it's ruined. I don't even understand this kids story. So what if his adoptive mother is an evil witch. She's nicer than 99.9% of the mothers out there.Unlike his real mother she didn't abandon him and actually wants to be his mother. I mean think about it she feeds him well, buys him toys to play with, drives him to school, takes him out eat, I mean what the heck. She's a great mother but this kid can't stop complaining about her. For what? Pampering and spoiling him? Worse thing she ever did was try to show him how to use magic. If this show stuck to the point and didn't jump back and fourth to this pointless Henry Mills side story it would probably be worth watching. Instead I just find myself looking to spend an hour doing something else before TWD comes on.and by all means do bring the thumbs down. Hate the idea that someone sees this series for what it is. Semi interesting plot trouble by bad writing/acting."
"This second season has the characters stuck in Neverland, and it drags on and on.Sorry to say that i lost interest."
"THE PARTIES AT the Hamptons are wild - especially at the Graysons. Season One gave us the murder at the engagement party; now we have a character dragged off to rehab at her mother's memorial service, the pregnant mother's swan dive at her baby shower, and the groom's arrest for murder at his wedding. My favorite character, the unpredictable Nolan Ross, played by Gabriel Mann, is dragged through serious trouble throughout the season.It's not looking good for him in Season Three either.Seems creator Mike Kelley and producers Mark B. Perry and Marty Bowen decided to opt out of their ""Count of Monte Cristo"" revenge motif and embrace the night time soap opera format - and it also seems there are plenty of people who love it once you count the rave reviews on Amazon. For me, it's not as good as Season One, where Emily Thorne (Emily Van Camp) donned her black hoodie and put the hammer down on those who had wronged her father and ruined their lives. I miss those photos, where she would cross off the guilty with a big red ""X"" after executing a clever payback.Now - surprise! - Emily has a boyfriend, a hunk she met in Master Takeda's school for revenge. There was no mention of this in Season One, but we are dealing with soap opera rules now, like is Amanda's baby Jack's or the result of a one night stand? Two major characters get over-the-top death scenes (where I began to wonder if they would actually die or not. They do.)Cinematography is excellent again, making the most of beautiful Southampton scenery, gorgeous sets and high fashion style. Madeleine Stowe, playing matriarch Victoria Grayson, wears a fantastic Vera Wang gown in the wedding episode; the designer is recognized in the end credits, too. Sound is just fine for this dialogue-driven show; the occasional ambient sound and special effect blends in well.ABC Studios also provides a generous batch of extras for Season Two beginning with three commentaries: executive producers Sunil Nayar and Melissa Loy, and writer/co-executive producer Michael Foley on ""Illusion""; executive producer/writer Mark B. Perry, writer/executive story editor Joe Fazzio and actors Nick Wechsler (Jack) and Margarita Levieva (Amanda)on another, and creator/executive producer/writer Mike Kelley and Emily Van Camp on ""Truth, Part Two."" The one with Kelley and Van Camp hint at spoilers for Season Three, so be on guard.There are three interesting featurettes: ""Schooled in Revenge,"" that gives us a peek at Master Takeda's new students in his martial arts school of vengeance; ""The Sound of Revenge,"" showing how iZLER composes music for the series; and ""Haute Hamptons: Dressing Miss Davenport"" with costume designer Jill M. Ohanneson again demonstrating how she chooses clothing for the characters, focusing on Ashley Madekwe, who plays Ashley Davenport this time. There are deleted scenes on each disc and the bloopers on Disc 5 are funny again, mostly because it's a treat to see the so-serious Stowe and Henry Czerny (Conrad Grayson) crack upWho knows if the series will return to its thriller format? Once sucked into soap opera, it's hard to get out of it. ""Revenge: Season Three"" will premiere on Sept. 29 on ABC.-- Kay Reynolds"
"Season one was very good.  The writers seem to have lost their way.  The plot is now incomprehensible.  Too bad, but like many shows, it simply ran off the rails.  Bizarre."
I'm always disappointed when a TV show starts out with a fantastic first season and then fizzles in the second.  It's almost like all of the creative energy was used up making the first season and then there's nothing left.  Or maybe they just ran out of things to say.  Either way it looks like it's happening with Revenge and I'm pretty bummed.  Looks like I have to find a new favorite show.
every one has their personality and sticks to it - but are all very moral decent peoplethe good thing if you watch on a regular basis - is that you see the ancillary California communities as the locationsthe best thing was Bradley Whitford's episode and the next best thing is Morena Baccarin's episode otherwise I found these episodes to be really horrible.
"I started watching this show because Monica Raymund was in the cast and, after watching all three seasons of &#34;Lie to Me&#34;, I think she's among the most provocatively beautiful, talented, and fascinating actors I've ever seen, but after watching &#34;Chicago Fire&#34; for most of season 1, I've given up because, apart from Raymund's Gabriela Dawson, for me there simply are no characters in the series who are interesting, likeable, or possible to care about, and more than a few are just plain aggravating - especially Taylor Kinney as the obnoxious Kelly Severide with Jesse Spencer, late of &#34;House&#34;, a pretty close second. This is really just a nighttime soap with the &#34;drama&#34; of fires added to give it what juice it has and that really isn't much. Eamonn Walker as the Chief is quite effective, but Charlie Barnett as Peter Mills is a ridiculous, puppy-like character who acts about 16. Others, of course, may well feel very differently, but I was very disappointed."
"Alex and his fellow film school friends receive a mysterious video link that suggests the frightening images from the GRAVE ENCOUNTERS film may have been for real. The group gathers their cameras and heads out to the old insane asylum where the film was originally shot to investigate, only to fall victim to the same insatiable spirits! GRAVE ENCOUNTERS 2 shares all of the first film's weaknesses without finding any of its strengths. At first, it seems like the makers may be parodying the ""found-footage"" genre just as they had done with the popular ghost hunting TV shows from before. By the end of the the first act, however, we come to the frightening realization that the atrocious acting, idiotic characters, and recycled plot points are all being taken seriously. The story borrows generously from Dave Parker's THE HILLS RUN RED with a touch of PARANORMAL ACTIVITY as John Poliquin and the Vicious Brothers prove to us that they have nothing new to bring to the table in this second installment. The same cheap effects and obnoxious scare tactics are employed once more, but what is the point of using the ""found-footage"" format when the images on screen are exaggerated to such an extreme? It then becomes impossible to accept any of the footage as being ""authentic,"" thereby destroying the illusion and rendering the film a complete failure. A little subtlety goes a long way, which is a lesson that the makers of GRAVE ENCOUNTERS have yet to learn.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
"Again, let me offer up this defense before I go any further: I'm not opposed to the whole `found footage' phenomenon.  As I've said, I think there's a spark of brilliance behind every one of these films.  If there's any fault to this entire movement, it's that too many stories that would be better served and received by being built as a regular feature (meaning NOT as a found footage vehicle) are, instead, being done on the fast and the cheap by taking this somewhat easy-way-out.  Still, if the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY franchise teaches us anything, it's that ""if you build it, people will come"" ... so settle in for the long haul, society.  It looks like `found footage' is here to stay.(NOTE: The following review may contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)I didn't see the original GRAVE ENCOUNTERS, so I'm only going on what I've been able to ascertain from some quick reading; but it looks like that 2011 flick tapped a vein: budgeted on a slick $1 million, it at least had legs strong enough to start a franchise, and it's second installment, GRAVE ENCOUNTERS 2, even garnered the embellishment of the Tribeca Film series, so that's none too shabby.  While the first feature explored what happened when the production crew of a ghost-hunting program actually ran afoul of real ghosts, the second tweaked the formula just a bit.Film student and horror enthusiast Alex Wright (played by Richard Harmon) believed that GRAVE ENCOUNTERS was a legitimate conspiracy released to audiences.  He contends that what happened in the ""film"" was actually a true story, but it was only ""marketed"" as a fictional film in order to get it before the masses.  Out to prove his point, he enlists the aid of his fellow classmates to scout out the real location of the original `encounters' so that they may probe the condemned psychiatric hospital for true spirits.  What he finds brings him face-to-face with some grim truths that might spell doom for those who joined him for such a personal haunting.This horror schlock is brought to you by the same team who did the first outing: the Vicious Brothers.  At a glance over on IMDB.com, it would appear this franchise is presently the only thing they have to their name, but, in their defense, there's enough charm, gore, and inspiration that I wouldn't be all that surprised to see more from them.  Granted, not every stone turned over here is all that original, but there's a pleasant enough mix of solid performances, predictable developments, and harmless scares that they're probably destined to do another one, at least, or launch some other screamer on unsuspecting audiences.What I didn't like was the blatant stupidity of so many of these characters.  Yes, I realize that a `working stupidity' kind of goes hand-in-hand with horror films.  But you would think that a group of young film nerds - ones who have made a college career out of mildly sending up the same genre with their own little pet projects - would know best what trips and traps to NOT fall into here.  Once they're deposited in the psychiatric hospital, all of what they knew before seems to vanish quicker than the first virgin (another horror film staple), and that's sad.  If they were so smart, why didn't they plan this all out better?  If they were so creative, why didn't they expect some of what awaited them?  If they truly believed everything in the first film was a legitimate spectral event, why wouldn't they have gone in better prepared than they did?I know, I know, I know.  It's a horror film, after all, and that's what suffices for a horror film in this day and age.  Put your brain on `pause' and you're liable to enjoy this one a bit more than I did.GRAVE ENCOUNTERS 2 is produced by Death Awaits Cinema, Twin Engine Films, and Pink Buffalo Films.  The film appeared as part of the Tribeca Film series.  DVD distribution is being handled by New Video.  As for the technical specifications, much of it looks and sounds solid, though there is some obvious distortion done deliberately due to the nature of the `found footage film' phenomenon; however, I didn't find any of it unusually distracting from the experience, though some muffled audio was tough to hear.  Sadly, there's only a single special feature; it's listed as ""An Interview with the Vicious Brothers,"" but it's essentially a 3-minute blurb about the film - I'm guessing it was almost what they said when they pitched this idea - and it's disappointing.RECOMMENDED only for fans of horror and/or found footage films.  Outside of the basic storytelling premise - that the Vicious Brothers kinda/sorta intended for this to be `respected' as a legitimate found footage flick - there's nothing new here.  As I've tried to be clear above, it's kinda/sorta sad that the whole `found footage phenomenon' has come full circle to the point now where fully realized stories that may've been better served by not being filmed this way (as `found footage') are still being churned out by an industry that apparently never heard a bad idea.  I think GRAVE would've been better constructed as a traditional horror film - the very ones it thumbs its nose at - but maybe that's just me.  Odds are that, if `found footage' is your thing, you might enjoy this one more than I did.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at New Video provided me with an advance DVD screener of GRAVE ENCOUNTERS 2 for the expressed purpose of completing this review."
"Grave Encounters 2 is a found-footage film that follows Alex, an aspiring filmmaker; Alex, who recently posted a negative review for ""Grave Encounters"", begins to receive eerie messages that have him questioning the original film's authenticity. Alex eventually believes the film is real, and convinces his friends to travel with him to the Grave Encounters' shooting location, a mental hospital, to get proof. Grave Encounters 2 has an interesting concept, but lacks the essential horror elements (terror, suspense, atmosphere, etc.)The story in Grave Encounters 2 is interesting; I know this concept has been done before, but it's not something that's been overdone, so I was genuinely interested. The execution, however, was poor. The film uses the first 30 minutes or so to build up the mystery and introduce/develop the characters. A horror film with build-up and characters? Great! However, the build-up/mystery in this film is very dull since it lacks suspense and creepiness, and the characters aren't actually deep, despite spending a third of the film learning about them- we see the surface of the characters, and they're irritable and illogical. So, the first act of the film is basically useless backstory that could've been told more efficiently.The rest of the film takes place in the mental hospital. Again, the tension is absent throughout the film; this makes the jump-scares ineffective, except for 1 or 2. Most of the film is the group walking into a room, seeing something paranormal and being chased out; running from room to room, you'd think you were watching an episode of Scooby Doo. I won't spoil the final third of the film, but it's actually somewhat decent; the explanation is twisted and somewhat unique; I'm sure there are a few hardcore Grave Encounter fans that will enjoy it. I'm not saying it's the greatest finale, but it adds to the dull atmosphere/tone of this film. My final complaint for the movie overall: the poor use of an immensely creepy and haunting setting- the opportunity to build a dreadful atmosphere is completely missed, and the setting is basically ignored. The acting was mostly good, occasionally some of the dialogue would feel forced and there was some overacting.Overall, Grave Encounters 2 has an interesting concept and a decent final act. But, most of the film is uneventful, boring, and uninspired; the tension is absent, the jump-scares are ineffective, and poorly uses, actually, completely forgets about it's setting. Barely enough to warrant 2 stars, I recommend a rental for horror fans. As of 2/23/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming.Grave Encounters 2 has strong violence and blood."
"If you loved The Vicious Brothers and their film ""Grave Encounters,"" they're hoping you'll flock to buy the next chapter of their horror saga creatively titled ""Grave Encounters 2.""  Utilizing the increasingly popular ""found footage"" genre that combines elements of the thriller into a faux documentary presentation, ""Grave Encounters"" was a reasonably effective (if not spectacularly original) entry into the horror arena.  It does seem that every low budget scary movie of late thinks that this is the go-to genre of filmmaking, so it's becoming more difficult to distinguish inventive works from the overcrowded pack.  This sequel employs the same device to carry out the story.  And it is just so tired already!  But as long as the movie has something fresh to offer, found footage can still make for a thrilling visceral experience.  I may not have hated ""Grave Encounters 2"" as much as some--but after a reasonably promising set-up, the film seemed to implode on itself with a lunatic (and ill conceived) final act.The movie takes place roughly two years after the events of the first movie.  A film student (Richard Harmon) is obsessed with the footage of the first film and decides to see if the events depicted were real or not.  As any remarkably sane person would do, he assembles some friends to break into the psychiatric hospital represented two years prior.  Even if everything is real (which he believes), his knowledge of the place and its monsters should provide plenty of clues for survival.  There isn't much more to tell without revealing spoilers.  I'll just say that the introduction (which takes a VERY LONG time) is handled well enough, but a major twist in the hospital kind of derails the franchise.  Very little makes sense after this revelation and the film just gets loopier by the second, and not in a particularly good way.I liked that there is a distinct connection to the first film. Here, The Vicious Brothers made a smart decision.  This movie presupposes that you've seen the original.  Although you can certainly watch this as a stand alone, the finale will lose some of its impact.  But maybe that's a good thing as I really thought that this was the weakest point in the series so far.  If you remember the stylistic differences between ""Blair Witch"" and its abysmal sequel, some of the same mistakes were made here.  It's almost too meta, too referential to the original and so it loses a unique voice of its own.  And with the choices made in the conclusion, it defies the logic of the first picture and this is always something that irritates me.  KGHarris, 3/13."
"First season was a nice, somewhat innocent, and enjoyable fish outta water story; but the second season is just about characters bed hopping and using each other."
"This film raises serious questions, such as should I give my copy away or throw it out? Randy (Patton Oswalt) is determined to take a group of boys on a scouting trip. He persuades the kids with a corny scout video to the dismay of everyone and absconds with the kids to the woods. The film had potential, but didn't know which way to go. The frequency of crude humor prevented it from being a kid's film. The crude juvenile humor prevented it from becoming a good adult film. It should have appeal to an adolescent crowd, one too young for the rating.The characters are poorly developed. Leonard, whose mother coddles him, is not utilized. Kent's attraction for the older women could have been made more for an adult audience, as long as the film is going that way. What was with the naked girl on the motorcycle? The opening scene was idiotic as scout masters take on the responsibility of informing a child his father has died.Are there funny scenes? Yes. In spite of all the crudeness, there were scenes which made me laugh, but too few to put up with a poorly written production. At one point I thought they were going to mimic ""Lord of the Flies,"" but that fell flat. I think a LOTF spoof would have worked better i.e. make Leonard a fat kid they call ""Piggy"" etc.Watch at you own risk.Parental Guide: Frequent F-bombs in front of children. Nudity (Jill de Jong model for Tomb Raider)"
I had expected more for the main character. So good in Friday Night Lights! This is weakly written and lacks polish.
"I really like country music and I enjoy relationships and I do not know anything about the music business.  The music in this show is a teaser---you get a few seconds of really good stuff and then it's off to something else.  I am sure they are doing that so people will buy the music but I do not like being manipulated like that.The relationships are smutty and flat and predictable.  Sort of like the old fashioned bad &#34;cryin' in my beer my gal done me wrong and my dog hates me too and I  smell just fine and if you don't like it you can kiss my  ....&#34;  songs.There is not one person who is a moral, upright, stalwart, good and Godly person to offset the smuttiness and dirtiness of the rest of the cast.  I want to have at least some hope that good will triumph---there is none of that here.So, this is not entertaining to me.  It is frustrating."
"IN THEIR SKIN stars Selma Blair and Josh Close as a young couple who move with their gentle son into Dad's family home.  Of course, there's a tragic family secret haunting them.  Soon they meet their over effusive neighbors played by James D'arcy and Rachel Miner and their bullying son who gradually insinuate themselves into their lives.The film moves languidly and there are no real surprises or genuine thrills.  Blair sleepwalks through her role and D'arcy adopts a Hannibal Lechter impersonation that just doesn't work.More intensity in the pacing and performances might have had better results.  Sadly, IN THEIR SKIN just doesn't succeed."
"This is another home invasion film. Mark (Joshua Close), Mary (Selma Blair), and their son Brendon (Quinn Lord) get away to their summer home when their daughter is killed in a car accident. While at their retreat they meet Bobby (James D'Arcy), Jane (Rachel Miner), and their son Jared (Alex Ferris). They get together for dinner where Bobby asks all kinds of questions and exhibits a high creep factor. This aspect was done very well as you can sense the creepiness in scene and characters.There is of course the later hostage situation and from the title and write up you know that these people want to take over the lives of the occupants. They did a lot to try to set this up, but I just didn't feel it like the creepiness. The problem with this film is that it lacked character. The characters were creepy, but were not colorful. Because the family was so bland, with Selma Blair looking gaunt, like a heroin addict, I didn't really care if they lived or died. In fact I was hoping they got knocked off early because they were boring. View at your own risk.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Selma Blair)."
"Technically poor, disjointed story in which nothing much happens and what does is not worth bothering with. I didn't finish it. Nuff said."
"Sorry to say, I could not watch the entire movie.Parker Posey played a complete wacked out lady within a loser script that should never have been written."
"Stephen Amell seems like he'd be a good guy to have a beer with, but he doesn't project much of anything else on the screen. No anger, no outrage, no affection, no enthusiasm, just ""I'm a nice guy"". That's still leagues better than what everyone projects, which is angst and fecklessness. It's hard to care about any of them.A few of the story lines are pretty good, others rather stupid, even if you accept the premise of a comic book world. The screen writers apparently feel a need to end each episode with a syrupy moral lesson, each of which is forgotten by the start of the next show; it wouldn't do to have the characters change and grow.I'd be surprised if the series lasted more than the first season."
"The actors are attractive and wooden. Good series for adolescents who are more into clothes, cars, gadgets, and romance, with a now-and-then bloody fight to break the monotony. As to &#34;Arrow&#34; himself: I am reminded of a review of Talullah Bankhead in Cleopatra: &#34;She displayed the gamut of emotion from A to B.&#34;"
"So here we have another series where a skinny model is able to whack around a bunch of guys much bigger than her. Come on. It's hard enough accepting the premise that every cop in the precinct--male or female--is drop-dead gorgeous, but that some chick weighing no more than a fistful of feathers can be sucker-punched by someone she has no reason to suspect, right out of the blue, and come back like Bruce Lee calls for way to much belief-suspension. I might give it a couple more views, but if the pilot is the best they can do, then I'll pass on the rest."
"That this show isn't really very good!NO SPOILERS:Let us start with Fiona, ah Kristin Kreuk, who may be best known by her supporting role as Scotty's unfaithful girlfriend in the movie ""Eurotrip"" (and music video featuring Matt Damon).  Fiona, AKA Kristin (I promise to get it right before the end of this review) AKA ""The Beauty"" plays Detective Catherine Chandler (Ivy League educated and studying for the Bar when her mother was killed)Jay Ryan AKA ""The Beast"" plays Vincent Keller, a doctor by trade that volunteered to go to Afghanistan and participate in an experiment that caused him to become ""The Beast"".  When the government decided to ""cancel"" the experiment, Vincent went underground both looking for a cure with the help of his Chemistry Professor friend J.T. (played by Austin Basis) and in his spare time helping people in trouble with his great strength and extraordinary sense of smellNina Lisandrello (Tess) adds some ethnicity and alternative ""hotness"", as Catherine's partnerMax Brown (Evan) is the obligatory good looking Forensic Specialist (with an English accent)So what is wrong with the show?Dude, I would take the scar and trade places with ""The Beast"" in a heartbeat!  The fact that Catherine is developing feelings for Vincent, simply isn't the stretch that the writers should have been looking for.  I mean Vincent in monster mode is still better than the guy that dumped her in the opening creditsKreuk has some mad fighting skills for a police detective, however, throughout the entire program I was hoping for a short skirt, lingerie scene or a slide show from her last beach vacation.  I couldn't even remember the case that they were working on.I understand that the series opened to good numbers (not as good as ""Arrow"") and works well back-to-back with ""Vampire Diaries"".  I just don't see ""it"".  Might be worth keeping on your DVR and watching during the holiday hiatus."
Kristen continues to find acting that portrays her in the &#34;same old - same old&#34; fashion.  Why did she pick the same old type of roll as she played in Smallville.
"The idea is okay for a special but there is too much sameness for a series. Also, these people seem a bit obsessive about their animals."
"I really like most medical dramas (thanks ER), but this one was missing something ... The main character was hard to watch and her need for attention from her best friend is ... Well ... Annoying."
"The first season was interesting and this second season was silly, now the third season looks soooo stupid I'm all together passing.....if you are going to buy this get the first season, the second is pretentious and not worth the money."
"I love a good mystery/thriller/action movie or TV show but American Horror Story is a bit too gory and visually graphic for me. I watched most of Season One but could not finish that season. Thought I'd try again, but had to turn off the video less than half way through. Perhaps if they left more to the imagination and less blood and guts??? but then it may not appeal to you. We all have our preferences, this one is not mine."
"I watched the entire first season, but found it difficult to watch as it is basically a soft porn made for Prime Time with disturbing sexual situations. That just isn't &#34;entertainment&#34; in my book. Now zombies, on the other hand...."
Big let down from season one. This year's show is much too over the top with the writers throwing in every horror cliche and then even more cliches. Back to the drawing board for season 3.
This season was too dark and violent for me. I made it to episode 4 and thought why am I watching this. Seems like they just want to shock you into how depraved they can make the show. I will pass on the rest of the season.
Don:t get it. _enjoyed the first season. This one doesn:t capture my interest from the first episode. Kinda of wondered what happened to the first family. _thought they would continue it.
Stupid is as stupid does. What a cluster f.... mess These poor souls find disaster everyway they go. I finally started feeling sorry for them but most of there woes they bring on themselves. If you are really bored maybe watch it.Chuck
I would not pay to watch this show it reruns constantly on regulartv. most of these guys don't know what they are doing. they are diggingup gravel and dirt thinking are are going to be millionaires. the mostexciting thing is figuring what the next crisis is going to be andwhich piece of makeshift equipment is going to break next.
Christopher has been in too many dark works since leaving Dr. Who---I loved him in that role and really missed him. Who needs one more crummy politician----
"There is a lot going on in the heavily stylized three part British miniseries ""Blackout"" and I don't always mean that as a compliment.  I was drawn to this presentation due to the involvement of Christopher Eccleston, an actor that I almost always find fascinating to watch.  While he gives a largely successful performance, the actual adaptation is overwrought and even borders on preposterous.  It may seem like an unusual feat to make something that is simultaneously over-simplified and over-complicated, but that's just what ""Blackout"" has done.  As a study of addiction, of infidelity, and of political machinations, ""Blackout"" is a show that had a lot of interesting themes to work with.  But nothing is explored in any real detail or depth, so there isn't much with which to emotionally connect.  And it doesn't help that the political side story is just plain silly!  To compensate for some of the plot's shortcomings, the show is fashioned as a quick-edited and jarring nightmare that leaps around in time.  While this disorientation might be a good approach in an addiction drama, it doesn't disguise the implausibility within the narrative structure of the program.Eccleston plays an alcoholic City Councilman who is caught up in corruption with a local builder.  After an intense confrontation kicks off Episode One, Eccleston awakes with only a vague memory of the previous night's events.  However, something seems amiss as he's covered in blood and the nefarious builder is in the hospital.  We see the scene repeatedly in short staccato bursts of memory, but can Eccleston piece together what happened and stay out of trouble?  A young woman. presumably a prostitute, was also on hand and her involvement with Eccleston is something that the viewer has to decipher with time.  As Eccleston's world seems to be crumbling, an unexpected act of violence brands him a national hero.  And this deeply flawed man has a chance to ascend to power.  Is this a time for cover-up or is it a time for redemption?  While this twist literally made me laugh out loud, I never believed it for a moment.While loud and over-produced, I did enjoy the set-up of ""Blackout.""  And the ridiculous twist was mightily entertaining. But I had a couple of major issues with the remainder of this three-parter.  The mystery is never particularly compelling, and the political power Eccleston wields never rings true.  Originally set up as a puppet leader, he grows more resistant and altruistic.  SLIGHT SPOILER:  As the show needs to come to an end, in one miraculously scene, he ends contract corruption once and for all within the city!  Easy as this, one man made a decision in one night and revolutionized the entire city government!  That's how things work, right?  END SLIGHT SPOILER.  In the end, I just didn't think ""Blackout"" was smart enough to work as a great political thriller but it also lacked the humor necessary to make it a pleasing potboiler.  An exercise in style over substance, you will have to overlook a lot in the plotting of ""Blackout"" to get much enjoyment out of the rather dour affair.  KGHarris, 12/12."
"okay show... i think the first season was better, but its still a great watch..no issues with playno issues with purchaseno issues at all!"
"while this wasn't my typical kind of sitcom, a little too edgy for me, it was still funny enough that I was willing to watch. Then it 'jumped the shark' with really crude language, as is typical with sitcoms these days. Apparently the writers mistake crude and graphic language for humor or else they assume the viewer won't know the difference. Sad."
"I've read where this is the last of the franchise that began in 1992 with Jean-Claude Van Dam and Dolph Lundgren at their peak.  It is the only one of the series that I saw and I don't remember much other than it was OK.  Here, they make brief appearances as leaders of the secret UniSols project.The headliner this time is Scott Adkins as John who appears to be just another citizen being awoken by his young daughter who hears something downstairs.  It is Luc Devaraux (Van Damme) and a few cutthroats who then torment John with the brutal murder of his family and beat him within an inch of his life.  John lives and of course seeks revenge.  But some things are fuzzy in his head as he mends in his hospital room.The plot didn't make any sense to me but then I missed all those sequels.  Still, good sequels can usually stand on its own.  This film is not much more than a traditional bad guys vs. good guy blood bath.  I did like some of the fight sequences and clearly Adkins knows what he's doing on the martial arts front.  So does Andrei Arlovski as one of Devaraux henchmen.  He and John have one great dual in a sporting goods store."
"In the opening scene John (Scott Adkins) sets the screen scene record for a non-cyborg to get hit by a crowbar and survive. As he wanders off into a coma as he watches Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) who is wearing gloves, murder his family. The FBI knows it is Luc, because he ""left his prints all over the place."" Now is this a clue, or just a screw up?John awakes from his coma and doesn't remember much of his life as he looks for Luc and tries to put things together. He discovers he was not a nice person and that entering a strip joint causes instant healing as he no longer has to use his cane to get around. He teams up with a dancer (Mariah Bonner) who knows the bad him and they go on an adventure having to fight off a ""Manchurian"" plumber who drives a truck with a self repairing hood.In order to keep things level, people who could act better than Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren were not considered for roles. All around a fairly sorry film for the franchise. Oh, not ""Halloween 3"" bad, but close.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, full frontal nudity (male and female), plenty of blood and exploding heads."
"ok, Claude and Dolf have gotten to be better actors over time and in this movie once they start acting, they like stop them at once and make them hit random people.  I don't get it.  (spoiler) Also when they brought back Dolf's character he started thinking for himself and the scientist hated it.  He just resurrected a guy and gave him a healthy brain.  You'd think he would be happy.  There were a lot of things I did not like about this movie.  It seemed like a waste.  It should have been about Claude and Dolf achieving independence and beating the robot brain soldiers but alas it was about brainless super troopers killing each other again. Boring."
"""What difference does it make, what more can you take from me?"" After a home invasion leaves his wife and daughter dead, John (Adkins) is after revenge from the group behind it. Since this is like the fifth movie in the series this review will be short. Either you will watch it or you won't. I have to say that this is not my kind of movie. I am not really into these type of let's make another movie in this series type movies. Movies like this with just action and no real story are not interesting to me. I know a lot of people will disagree with me but I had a hard time staying with this movie and by the end I was just glad it was over. Overall, not my kind of movie. I give it a D+."
"""Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning"" stars Jean-Claude Van Damme, Scott Adkins, Andrei ""The Pit Bull"" Arlovski and Dolph Lundgren (credited in that order). The new Universal Solider film is directed by John Hyams, responsible for so-so action flick ""Universal Soldier: Regeneration"" (2009) and just plain terrible ""Dragon Eyes"" (2012).First things first. ""Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning"" is not a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie. Van Damme's role here is only as an extended cameo, and his fight scene is rather brief, and so is that of Dolph Lundgren. I don't even know if I should call it a Universal Soldier movie, as in ""Day of Reckoning"" there is hardly any sci-fi element that was still seen in ""Regeneration.""Still I expected something exciting from the film as the star of ""Day of Reckoning"" is Scott Adkins, who can really do action. Adkins plays a man named John, who, heavily injured, wakes up in a hospital to learn that his beloved wife and daughter were brutally murdered by masked intruders. So far, so good.As the story goes on, however, it becomes clear that the film is going nowhere. Action is brutal and gory (that's fine), but terribly drawn-out and poorly edited. The confusing story (including the lengthy non-action opening scene that should be much shorter) doesn't make much sense. There is one decent car action sequence, but ... is Scott Adkins, a martial artist, hired for this?As you know, Van Damme, Adkins and Lundgren were also seen in ""The Expendables 2."" They are just part of the cast, but they did much better jobs there."
Acting was very poor and plot was not good with many unbelievable events included. Would not recommend unless you are really &#34;in&#34; to old war movies.
"This was chosen by my s o,so I can only give a review based on their opinion.To be honest,they never finished this video as they do not care for subtitles on the screen during viewing.Their opinion is that if they wanted to read they would open a book.I suppose some find the subtitles distracting,not me.I wish I would have watched,but am not fond of the WWII genre in film,or any war movie,for that matter."
"This story of robbery went wrong and the brother sister criminals tried to escape with the loot in the snowy countryand held locals as hostages is so old, forced and predictable that it is boring.It is a complete waste of (this viewer's) time.Second worst film of recent years, after ""The Paper Boy""."
"I have a theory, possibly true, possibly not, than any movie involving someone named Zach or Josh will be terrible.  This movie falls into the terrible category.  A great noir has a sense of inevitability about it, but also surprise.  This film had nothing but cliches without irony.  Lets see incestuous Southern siblings,  Father and daughter cops. Violent boxer in jail for something who throws a fight.  In a great noir, the boxer's taking a fall would have something to do with the killers.  But that would be a film I'd like to watch, not a film like that I laughed my way through.  Now, Todds are solid in the film world.  Maybe if a Todd had written or directed this film, it might have been better.  How did this movie get made?  How?"
I think this was a really good film it seemed short but It was enjoyable. I think if you liked FROZEN or WOLFS or love films with some violence but not overdone with it... films done in the snow... you will love this.
Storyline was predictable after the first 30 minutes and a polite psycho is not really believable. It was good to see Kenny Rodgers again though
"Deadfall is a white noir, instead of being told in the shadows of the mean streets of the corrupt city, it takes place in the wide open snow covered wilderness. It is easy to identify that Deadfall wants to conjure up memories  of Fargo  or any other Cohen brothers movie for that matter, but ends up simply stuck a drift in it's own snow storm of tedium. This isn't a bad movie, per say, but it is middling, predicable and more often than not, dull. Which comes as a shame because the movie has a real great cast that is game for something more meaty.Telling the story of Addison (Eric Bana) and Liza (Olivia Wilde), a brother and sister team that just stuck up a tribal Casino. A car wreck leaves their driver dead and them stranded in the cold Michigan wilderness heading for the Canadian border.  They become separated and Liza hooks up with a stranger, Jay (British actor Charlie Hunnam), an Olympic silver medalist pugilist just out of jail and already on the run again. He wants to go home for Thanksgiving, but they end up stuck at a roadside motel for the night. She pretends he's her brother and he pretends she's a playboy centerfold, and somehow through all this they fall in love.Also add another subplot involving small town cop Hannah Becker (Kate Mara), trying to prove herself in a man's world and dealing with daddy issues involving the local sheriff (Treat Williams), who may be her father, but he is also a sexist, arrogant lout.Deadfall starts off very well with a great hook, but as it goes along it becomes tiresome and conventional. The early cinematography by Shane Hurlbut is excellent with a nicely done car crash and an exciting chase on snowmobiles, but like everything else in this movie becomes more pedestrian as it trots along.Directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky, an Austrian born director who won an Oscar for 2008's the Counterfeiters, making a very mild mew English language debut. Working from a half backed script by first time screenwriter Zach Bean, who manages yo fit more clich&eacute;s in a ninety-five minute movie than just about anyone this year. Bean's script seems cobbled together by bits and pieces of other movies, and not necessarily there best parts. It's plotting, it is rushed and there is little or no character development.Deadfall manages to almost descend into self parody with it's obvious and contrived ending that feels like the old Humphrey Bogart movie Desperate Hours, which itself was remade by Michael Cimino and starred Mickey Rourke, with a very special Thanksgiving twist. A holiday showdown in the snow.A very good cast is all that keeps this afloat. Eric Bana is superb in the central role, a tough guy villain that is easy to root for. Olivia Wilde proves she's much more than merely eye candy here, she is sweet, scared and sympatric in the role, she makes Liza simply more human, and this could be Wilde's best work so far.Kate Mara is excellent as rookie police officer Becker, she's smart and tough with the offbeat charisma that Mara is good at exhibiting. She's pretty, but not glamorous, and gives a clich&eacute;d role a more firm footing in reality, or at least she makes it appear so.Charlie Hunnam is just okay as Jay, a poor man's Tom Hardy the role is so underwritten that the actor is given little time to do much of anything, he's just there as the movie's handsome stranger, a rather dull protagonist.Add reliable veteran performers Kris Kristofferson and Sissy Spaceck as Jay's folks, and Treat Williams as the sheriff, this highly capable cast really cooks. Unfortunately it adds up to more of a cold lunch than a holiday feast.Deadfall is a slight and unmemorable thriller, it's laughable in all the wrong ways and doesn't add up to a impressive Thanksgiving themed movie. Although it would be interesting to see what happens after diner, I mean some people have some explaining to do that could have added up to something more interesting than what we have here. This time of year you can do better. Give the gift of love and take some you care about to see something else.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com"
"This movie, starring Elizabeth McGovern among others, has an obvious similarity to Downton Abbey and no doubt fans of that wonderful series will be drawn to it. But the similarity is all on the surface. In fact, this turns out to be a pretty dour and rather boring excursion into the emotional stuntedness of the English upper middle classes during the 1930s.It all takes place at a country house in Devon on a single day. Dotty, a rather vapid young thing who is pretty but not much else, is marrying the square-chinned Owen. But she has invited her former swain Joseph to the festivities -- and he for some reason has come. The house fills with guests, none particularly interesting, and Dotty knocks back slugs of rum while waiting for Joseph to do something -- which he never quite manages.We also get flashbacks to the lovers the previous summer, boating on the river, kissing in the conservatory, running through the rain etc etc. We wait for them to give in to the dictates of the heart - and wait and wait and wait until the closing credits.Downton Abbey is great not only because the characters are vivid and memorable and the writing and acting are superb but because we also learn something about the way English society was changing before, during and after the Great War. The web of relations between upstairs and downstairs is interesting and provides for great drama.This movie does none of that. It is simply mediocrity dressed up in nice clothes with smart British accents."
"I went into this movie without any expectations, but I like wedding movies and thought I'd give it a try.  The primary female character has great screen presence. The story had potential, and I enjoyed the flash back technique used to tell the story. But the plot moved slowly and didn't quite close the loop. Kind of ended with a thud."
"The best thing I can say about this film is that there are nice shots of pretty clothes and a lovely upper-class English home in the early 1930's.The main character, a self-absorbed wealthy young girl, is torn between the man she is about to marry and a former lover.  She is pretty in a vacuous way, but with an annoying habit of posing with her two front teeth resting on her lower lip.  I guess that's what privileged young girls did in England at that time?  Her groom to be is a handsome cheerful chap but we don't see much of him.  Who we do see ""moping about"" is last summer's boyfriend, a chinless lad with all the charm of the tortoise he gave her.  It turns out, in the only interesting scene in the film, that he may have impregnated her, in which case the child will have the worst features of both---egad!  The bride, who is supposed to be not only pretty but witty and charming  (we don't see that but we are told that she is) has the stock plain, little sister whom everyone ignores.  There are other stock characters...Miss Spoon who gets herself locked in the bathroom....a little boy who plants confetti bombs on the stuffier family members and the ""charming"" but dreadfully interfering mother (well played by Elizabeth McGovern).I suppose if I cared a whit about who this dim, blah girl eventually married I'd have enjoyed the film.  But I didn't."
"A friend of my wife recommended this movie to us, saying it was extraordinary, and after watching it, I cannot help but wonder how good a friend she really is :) This is one miserable movie, based on a premise that is not really original, with many unlikable characters and that at times moves at snail's pace. The first 10 minutes were so bad that I am surprised I kept watching. After that it does get slightly better, but it never really delivers much to the viewer.The only redeeming aspect is some humorous moments that got chuckle from me, but the story and most of the characters were unlikable. The plot revolves as you can guess around a wedding, and we have the strong-willed bride that likes to have everyone marching at her own pace, the former boyfriend who we know is going to try to sweep the bride away, the conniving mother, the oblivious groom and a myriad of quirky family members. The use of flashbacks to tell the story of the bride and Joseph, her summer love, was OK, but nothing special.The performances are nothing to write home about, and as it should be clear by now, I am not satisfied at all with the experience. Luckily it was relatively short! I really recommend staying away from this one. My wife loves most British movies and she also thought this was rubbish."
"Director Stephen Frears (""The Queen"", ""High Fidelity"", ""Dangerous Liaisons"") and screenwriter D.V. DeVincentis (""High Fidelity"", ""Grosse Point Blank"") are back together again for a new film based on the memoirs of American writer and journalist Beth Raymer, a memoir about her experiences in the sex industry, amateur boxing and sports betting.The film would feature an all-star cast starring Bruce Willis (""Die Hard"" films, ""The Sixth Sense"", ""The Fifth Element""), Catherine Zeta-Jones (""Chicago"", ""The Terminal"", ""Entrapment""), Vince Vaughn (""Wedding Crashers"", ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", ""The Break-Up""), Rebecca Hall (""The Prestige"", ""Frost/Nixon"", ""The Town""), Joshua Jackson (""Fringe"", ""Dawson's Creek"", ""The Skulls""), Laura Prepon (""That 70&#8242;s Show"", ""October Road"", ""Are You There, Chelsea?"") and Corbin Bernsen (""L.A. Law"", ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", ""Psych"").VIDEO:""Lay the Favorite"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  For the most part, picture quality for the film is very good.  Colors are vibrant and really look good outdoors.  Really good detail when it comes to closeups and colors black levels are nice and deep.  I didn't notice any problems with the overall picture quality, no aliasing or artifacts.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Lay the Favorite"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  The film is primarily all dialogue driven and dialogue is crisp and clear.  Not a film where you would hear a lot of surround usage but you do hear a bit of the ambiance come into play during the film.  But for a film like this, the lossless soundtrack was appropriate.Subtitles are in Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Lay the Favorite"" come with the following special features:Deleted Scenes - (7:41) A total of 11 deleted scenes.JUDGMENT CALL:""Lay the Favorite"" may have been a fascinating memoir to read but as a film, I feel that the film tried to incorporate comedy but also be a bit deep at the same time but it just doesn't work.The primary character of Beth Raymer comes off in the film as a girl who loves her job of pleasing men as an in-home stripper, showing her body and getting what she wants but trying to make money and survive.  When compared to the original memoir, there is a much better story as Beth is trying to balance life at Florida State University and to pay her way through college life, she becomes a stripper.  But because of her not being satisfied or she was fired from these jobs, that's the reason why she moved to Las Vegas.I really don't know if the real Beth Raymer was anything like the film version of Beth Raymer but the film's first half hour tries to feature Beth as a naive sex kitten that who is a stripper, tries to have sexual relations with her boss and fidns a guy at a casino and has sex with him immediately after they met.While the film tries to focus on high-stakes gambling, you're left thinking...""really?"".  Not to say that Rebecca Hall's portrayal of Beth Raymer makes her out like an ""airhead"" but perhaps instead of focusing on the sexy side of Beth Raymer, at the beginning of the film, there should have been some glimpse of her brilliance with numbers that is later mentioned in the film.  That Beth is actually a smart young woman, not just some kind of vamp.  Also, unless you have an interest in sports-gambling, the film is really lacking in structure and not that entertaining.Of course, we eventually see Beth grow in the ranks of high-stake gambling when she moves to New York City and starts to make money for herself.  But by then, I'm wondering to myself, is this really a Stephen Frears film?  And what an unlikely film to find Bruce Willis and Catherine Zeta-Jones in.  But do give the film some credit in the fact that Bruce Willis, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Joshua Jackson and Vince Vaughn made ""Lay the Favorite"" much more of an enjoyable film because they appeared in it.The Blu-ray release does feature very good PQ and for dialogue-driven film, lossless audio was also good.  And for special features, you get eleven deleted scenes.Overall, ""Lay the Favorite"" was a film that may have featured a talented director and also featured a cast of big names but unfortunately, with an uninspired screenplay, the characters weren't fully utilized and the film just lacks anything of interest unlike the original memoir that the film was based on. Probably worth a rental but nothing more."
"It wasn't exactly easy to make it to the end of the tone deaf comedy ""Lay The Favorite."" When I got there, though, I was in for a huge shock. The credits rolled and I realized that Stephen Frears was responsible for directing this! In case you haven't heard of him, the Oscar nominee has orchestrated some truly great films including The Queen, The Grifters, and Dangerous Liaisons. Well nothing could be further from these excellent films than this flight of fancy. Based on a true story, an expose on the world of gambling by Beth Raymer, the plot had the potential to be absolutely fascinating. In fact, I'd love to read Raymer's memoir. I think it would be very enlightening. But instead of a hard hitting drama, Frears has removed any sense of reality from the picture. I don't care that he wanted to make something light and comedic, but this isn't serious enough for a drama, funny enough for a comedy, informative enough for gambling enthusiasts, or rich enough in character so that anyone might actually care about what happens. In short, the movie has no idea what it wants to be and that is very apparent.Rebecca Hall plays the central character as a chirpy stripper who is simultaneously brilliant and clueless. She dreams of the big time, she wants to be a waitress in Las Vegas! She gets involved, instead, with an odds-maker played by Bruce Willis. She's a natural at the game and soon becomes invaluable to the operation. Willis's wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) doesn't like the closeness between the two and this causes much friction. As Hall sets out on her own, she gets into some trouble from which she may not be able to extricate herself. Hint: It involves Vince Vaughn. It just might require a little help from her friends and a caper is afoot. And boy, there's no stopping this crew when they are joined!One of my biggest issues with ""Lay The Favorite"" is that it is all over the map in tone. And none of it really works, nothing is developed in enough depth to get you involved. Even the gambling aspect of the picture is lackluster and pedestrian. I never cared about anything that happened. Willis seems to be sleepwalking, Hall is positively grating, and everyone else is pretty much wasted. Hall has a love affair with Joshua Jackson, but we never know the first thing about him. The character development is so sketchy as to be virtually non-existent. A few of the smaller roles scored and Zeta-Jones has presence. The experience, for me, had no real laughs, no real danger, no real romance. I've certainly been a fan of Frears, Willis and Zeta-Jones in other projects. Here, though, I'm hard pressed to tell you anything that I like about this misguided effort. About 1 1/2 stars, I'm not sure why I'm rounding up. KGHarris, 3/13."
"Having finished watching Stephen Frears' ""Lay the Favorite,"" I am still unsure what to make of this ""true story"" based on Beth Raymer's memoir of her experiences in the sports-betting industry in Las Vegas. The film has one interesting subject matter, to be sure, and benefits from the fine performance from Rebecca Hall as the spirited heroine, but with its unfocused and disjointed narrative ""Lay the Favorite"" simply doesn't know what it is doing.An in-home exotic dancer Beth travels from Florida to Las Vegas, dreaming of becoming a cocktail waitress at a casino. As luck would have it, she gets a job working for a bookie Dink Heimowitz (Bruce Willis). Beth, who is good with numbers, becomes a sort of good luck charm for Dink and even gets romantically involved with him before his wife Tulip (Catherine Zeta-Jones) comes back and interferes.The story may sound interesting. Actually, it is not, jumping from one scene to the next without developing any of the characters. In ""Lay the Favorite"" you will never know anything about the betting industry. That itself is not a big problem if the film allows us to know the characters. Beth meets characters played by Corbin Bernsen, Frank Grillo, Joshua Jackson, John Carroll Lynch, Laura Prepon and Vince Vaughn. The impressive cast does their best, but frankly, we really don't care what happen to these uninteresting cyphers.The only exception to the mediocre writing is the film's protagonist Beth, who, thanks to Rebecca Hall, remains attractive even when her character is not really credible. Despite her effective acting, ""Lay the Favorite"" seems trying not to entertain us, by omitting or blurring critical points of her story that should be more interesting."
Not a great movie.  If you can watch it for free that go for it.  My bet is that you turn it off after about 15 minutes.
"The ""found footage"" technique is taking film by storm. Expect more of it. Soon, we'll look at ""regular"" films like we do now at silent films.  And get this.... it's SUPPOSED to be poor quality. Creates a believable and empathetic viewpoint for the viewer. But the science here is a joke. Yes, the fish tongue parasite exists, but everything else is just bunkum. The list is a long one, but I mean, really??? Chicken manure monsters? There is really nothing scary here once all the people have died except dead bodies. And the sick guy jumping out at the end is just LAME! Not worth paying to see except to see the power of found footage technique."
"Well here we have another ""found footage"" flick to add to the ever growing genre, where some are great, some good, some average, but lately a lot have been awful. ""The Bay"" tells a story of what happened to a small town in Maryland in 2009 when something in the waters of Chesapeake Bay starts making the citizens sick and makes others do strange things. We hear from a news reporter named Donna (Kether Donahue, ""Pitch Perfect""), who tells her story and shows us what happened through footage she shot and found. Director Barry Levinson (""The Natural"", ""Rain Man"", ""Bandits"") tries to make this story work as best he can, but sadly this material is tired and seems all too familiar.The first 30 minutes aren't too bad as we see the early signs that something is wrong with some of the people in the town, but what is the real cause? Sadly by the time it's revealed the ability to care about the cause or any of the actors in the movie is pretty much gone. I don't fault Levinson for trying a different type of movie compared to his previous work but this is a lot like ""Sphere"", a good idea but pretty lousy execution. It's certainly not as bad of a found footage flick as oh say ""The Hollow"" was, but ""The Bay"" isn't very good. *1/2 out of 4 stars."
Good concept but the build up was drug out. I found myself falling asleep a few times. The acting was good but te &#34;live footage&#34; made me feel dizzy and sick. It was hard to stay in suspense with the shacking vibe.
"I did not like the movie, I am a horror movie junkie ( if there is such a thing). This  was not horror to me."
If you watch any of the SyFy channels self produced movies then you'll know what to expect. Has some entertainment value but don't expect good special effects.
"""The first signs that something was wrong happened 6 weeks before July 4th."" While setting up for the big July 4th festivities a small town in Maryland discovers some residents dead and no clues as to why. The more the doctors investigate the scarier it gets until the whole town is soon infected. This is yet another found footage type movie but it isn't like most of the others. This one is done in more of a interview fashion with the footage being used to help tell the story. Also because of the director (who has done real movies such as Rain Man and The Natural) the movie is technically much better then most of these types. The problem is that even though it flows better and looks better it is still a little boring. The way it is presented makes it seem like more of a documentary then a horror and I was not really scared at all watching. I will say that if you are a fan of these found footage type movies then you will most likely really like this too. Overall, better then most movies like this but not scary and a tad slow. I give it a C."
"I really dislike movies that apologize for being made in the first few minutes the lead actress looks into the camera and suggests they should have hired a voice actor. She was right. And a director. And an editor. And some actors. Oh, and a story that can keep you from falling asleep. Five minutes of dead fish tells you all you need to know about this stew - it's a plague movie and it's as dead at its victims. If you finished it, you were a victim too, because you just wasted an hour and a half of your life.Hey here's an idea; let's take an unusual phenomenon that has plenty of free film so we don't have to film anything, and we'll just throw it into the air and tape together what falls out.The movie belongs in The Bay."
Nothing new here. Move along. Even my son-in-law who used to love this show is bored by it. Catch the damn thing and put these shows out of business.
"Yolanda is oh so superior.  She imagines she takes the moral high ground (that whole rotten apples analogy was ridiculous and made her sound stupid), and her worship of that husband of hers is nauseating.  Mark my words, the Yolanda and what's his name marriage will be finished within five years. Just as an aside, Kyle has the worst taste in the entire universe.  Truly hideous clothes she has chosen for her store.  Does anyone take this stuff seriously?  These women stand for much of what is wrong with America, IMO.  It embarrasses me that people in foreign countries might see this program and think that this is what American women are all about.  Oh, but wait a minute, Yolanda is from Holland isn't she, and she just soars above the others in awfulness.  (I realize that I am watching it and find it to be the best in icky entertainment.And dear little Kim, struggling to stay sober and wanting these awful people to support her when they are just waiting for her to fail.  They are the wrong support system for you, Kim.  You would be wise to keep your distance and seek support from those who understand your struggle.One more thing, I do absolutely love Jiggy and Lisa's sweet, sweet husband, who carries Jiggy around happily. Lisa lucked out with that man, I think.  He is the best of the lot."
This show seems boring to us
"There's just something about lance henriksen's work for years and years that attracts me..Even enjoyed his television work on series 'Millennium&#34;., which i didn't always GET, but it did provide a different sort of t.v.programing...On a whim, bought this second hand online for rainy day entertainment,when ive read all my books...(yup,it's true..no KINDLE.).Still luv lance's gravelly,smoke weary voice and that face that carries deep grooves,..but thats about it..Don't believe i finished watching it..Gave up..What the hell is that crap stalking the woods???Why oh why, must movie people throw in those endless flashbacks of a beautiful,mysterious girl, laughing, twirling ,running her perfect face,skinny butt, through fields of flowers???After having viewed thousands of movies in time, this is an immediate turn off.~~~~Of course, we realize early on,she's going to have to pay the price....Ah, well, if your a newbie to film, or very young, u might like this sorta thing, some grisly moments newbies might enjoy and then of course a little sex strewn about,which im not opposed to...but all in all, not for me. It was juvenile...Instead look up some of lances's old work, like in ALIEN;or theres a movie he made years ago where he is part of a marauding bunch of vamps, that is down and dirty, AND thoroughly enjoyable...What was it's name?...darn it...sometimes menopause sucks."
"Typical formula murder mystery that falls shy of the intended goal. Matthew Rhys is surprisingly good as the bad guy, but police-trained people, or even amateurs, who watch the show will be more than disappointed."
"Did not finish watching the movie, did not care for the plot. I found the movie to be a bit gory."
"Truly one of the worst movies I've seen -- writing, directing, acting, you name it. The lead actress was absolutely pathetic. If this is how Nancy Grace views herself, it speaks volumes. I'd rather have a root canal than see this movie again."
Strange movie that had a very strange ending. Acting was average and story line OK but not great. Not a great movie but acceptable.
"In the long tradition of ""women behind  bars"" movies ""Prison Girls"" ranks near the bottom (an achievement of sorts). It is a terrible movie shot on a cheap budget with a script that was apparently made up as they went along.  It does feature a LOT of nudity, in fact that is the only noteworthy thing I really remember about the ten minutes or so that I watched.  I skipped ahead to see if it got any better but it didn't. There is also some simulated sex that manages to avoid being the least bit erotic.  I do remember thinking this would make a great beer night movie for college kids.  BTW: the two stars doesn't mean I didn't ""like it"".  It means I found it well below average."
"WIP flicks are what they are. They nearly (nearly) transcend criticism because they are a hard and fast genre requiring certain obligations to be fulfilled. This one tries to skirt some of those obligations.Here's the scoop. A handful of female inmates are granted a 2 day pass to the outside to see if they can re-assimilate into society (right). This follows them on their attempts.Other than Uschi Digard and Candy Samples I didn't know any of these actresses (actresses?). The schtick here is to get the girls out of the prison with the 2 day pass scenario. It opens with the obligatory shower scene and ensuing cat fight and is followed up with the girls visiting the prison psychiatrist as to why this 2 day pass can do them well. We then see how each uses the pass which amounts to little more than one sex scene after another.Yup. Cheap sets. Bad acting. Bad writing. Bad directing. But we're not here for that. We want the babes and there are babes aplenty. Problem is, everything is so bad the bare babes become tiresome after little time. Sex scenes, even soft core sex scenes, can be arousing. Not so here. They wear out their welcome pretty quick. The real highlights are seeing Uschi and Candy and even those left me wanting.There are a lot of these kinds of flicks out there and most (maybe all) are better than this one. Seek them out first"
Ok so I bought this movie because it was 99cents. The only reason I plan to keep it is because in the future if anyone asks what happened to Lindsay Lohan's career I can just show them this film.
"There is something strangely fascinating about the casting of a downward spiraling Lindsay Lohan as screen icon (and two time Oscar winner) Elizabeth Taylor. Lohan is an easy target, to be sure, so I entered into the Lifetime original movie ""Liz & Dick"" with a reasonably open mind. It's true that this TV movie was lambasted critically, but it also became one of cable's biggest ratings hits of 2012. So, if nothing else, the Lohan factor created a certain curiosity. In that way, Lifetime came out the winner. That said, I might not have expected greatness, depth, or insight out of ""Liz & Dick,"" but I did anticipate a bit of fun. With a history of cheesy and over-the-top movies, I thought this might be a genuine guilty pleasure. Highlighting the tempestuous relationship between Taylor and Richard Burton (played by Grant Bowler, now on SyFy's Defiance), there was lots of room for campy fun. Alas, this never comes to fruition. Too superficial to be truly enlightening and too serious to be much fun, ""Liz & Dick"" doesn't make much of a mark at all.The movie is centered, for the most part, around the Cleopatra shoot that put Burton and Taylor together for the first time. Not much in the way of introduction is done for either, so hopefully you know something about each career-wise to put the story into context. Taylor is a diva, Burton a charming boozer. Both are married, but are somehow drawn to one another. Looking at the movie, however, there is nothing to establish this as a grand passion or a legitimate romance. There is a mild opposites attract flirtation and suddenly they are dissolving their marriages. They get together only because they're supposed to, to heck with demonstrating any real drama or relationship building. This by-the-numbers biography is so vague and unenlightening, they try to add content by staging interludes where Taylor and Burton reminisce in spare interview sequences.If you are familiar with Burton and Taylor, ""Liz & Dick"" offers absolutely no new insight into the pair. Chances are that if you have a preexisting knowledge of this film era and a love of movies, you are already smarter than the film's screenplay. I feel like this was made as an introduction to those who have zero exposure to the actual back story. But if that's the case, the movie doesn't dig deeply enough into the dynamics of the relationship or provide anything that defines this couple as the Hollywood royalty that they were. As for the performances, the great Theresa Russell is completely wasted as Taylor's mother. Bowler is likable enough, I suppose, but doesn't have much to work with. And Lohan lacks impact as a woman that could captivate the world. Truthfully, though, it is the tepid screenplay that makes ""Liz & Dick"" so dull. As I said, this didn't have to be great but it should have been fun! KGHarris, 5/13."
"Liz and Dick were the Brad and Angelina of their era...on steroids. The tabloids kept us inform of all the dirt in their life. This was a tabloid view at best.The film is told in part as a flashback with narration by Liz (Lindsey Lohan) and Dick (Grant Bowler) starting with the filming of ""Cleopatra."" I thought Lindsey Lohan would be right for the role, although she played it without class and style. Oh, they did get the contacts right. I kept waiting for that moment to tie the film together, to make everything I was watching on the screen suddenly become meaningful. It didn't happen. Grant Bowler had the lines down, but face it...he doesn't command the stage presence of Richard Burton.The screenplay was horrible. I don't think the film could have been any worse if John Belushi had played both title roles."
"Movie is bad, but story of Elizabeth (as she preferred to be called) and Richard (as he preferred to be called) is a slight look into their story, as blurred as it may be.Lindsey not a very good actress but seems to have a connection with Elizabeth (this role).Its not worthy of any awards or a movie screen but if you love The Burton's you may want to see this."
"Didn't really like the show.  We tend to watch only G through PG-13 so sometimes we start watching a show because of the rating and decide it is not for us when we get into it. This is what happened with this paticular movie.  Wish you had more selection in these catagories.I will never watch an R-rated movie and there seems to be rather a lot of them, on Prime"
Well it started slowly and never made a momentum.  I turned it off after 30 mints may be if you watch it longer it would make sense.
"I've found that message movies for the most part offer incredibly boring films that while trying to speak from the heart inevitably fail to entertain or hold your attention for long. Rarely does one succeed. For the most part these movies fail miserably and disappear from memory quickly. How many can say that they're fans of LIONS FOR LAMBS? You don't recall it? Not a surprise.For the most part message movies don't do much harm, though on rare occasions overzealous film makers tend to offer simplistic discussions promoting a topic they believe rather than an unbiased account. The majority of these movies seem to head straight to DVD rather than receive theatrical runs. That's not always a bad thing. Once in a while a decent movie comes out and gets into homes this way. Such is the case with A DARK TRUTH.Andy Garcia stars as Jack Begosian, an ex-CIA agent who now hosts his own political talk radio program. Trying to rebuild his life and steer clear of his past, Begosian must face his history when he is asked by one of the owners of a water purification company to investigate the particulars of a small village in South America. It seems that almost everyone there died of something wrong in the water. Begosian at first refuses but when he is told that the leader of a small group trying to get the truth out is Francisco Francis (Forest Whittaker) he agrees. It seems that Begosian owes a debt to Francis but we're not aware of what that is until later.On the run from corrupt leaders and military officials Francis and his group move through the jungle simply trying to avoid capture. Amazingly Begosian has no problem finding them though. He approaches them and offers them help at about the same time the military shows to take out as many as they can. On the run Begosian learns what the actual problem is and that Francis has the proof that will show the world what happened.The message here becomes one of corporate greed and manipulation. The evil corporate giant that has contracts around the world in water purification and management has failed in the small town mentioned before. Rather than seek out a solution to the problem they instead have tried to erase it so they can continue to market their product around the world and increase their wealth. Why they wouldn't seek out a solution to the problem so they can continue to profit from a good product doesn't matter. What matters is portraying corporations as all evil, all bad and all willing to kill to keep information from reaching the public.So yes, the film becomes predictable for the most part. It still is well made and acted and offers some mild entertainment. Just don't get sucked into the message. Are there terrible corporations in this world who will exploit the masses for a buck? I have little doubt. But cookie cutting movies will most likely not be the thing that leads to change. Still the movie offers a mild distraction and decent enough production values to make it worth watching."
"Jack Begosian (Andy Garcia) is a former CIA operative who has retired to Toronto and hosts an all-night talk-radio show.  Hey, why not?  For nearly all the movie he anguishes about something in his CIA past, but never tells us any specifics.  At the same time, way down in Ecuador, Francisco Francis (Forest Whitaker) and his wife Mia (rifle toting Eva Longoria) are being chased by the army for undermining a Canadian water purification project headed by evil capitalist Bruce Swinton (Kim Coates).It seems that the huge water corporation screwed things up and allowed typhus to enter the water system, killing many locals.  If that wasn't bad enough, a corrupt general is executing any and all who try to escape.  Tipped off by a suicidal escapee, Swinton's sister, and major stockholder, Morgan (Deborah Kara Unger) convinces Jack with some big bucks to exfiltrate the Francis family, shedding light on the dirty business.  Jack reluctantly accepts the assignment realizing it will give him an opportunity to correct what happened when he was last in South America.  Oh, and the big bucks.While much of the photography is excellent, writer and director Damian Lee bungle the production with a ridiculous script.  Unger doesn't help much with her dour characterization that never changes from a zoned out aristocrat.  Garcia is much better, especially given the words he has to work with.  Kevin Durand is a hired assassin who changes direction, one that is easily foreseen.  Even with its heart in the right place, the film is preachy to a fault."
"You have some interesting actors in this movie, however, the script is so unbelievable.  The movie never really comes together because the characters don't have any chemistry."
"Mindless brutality has been done so many times it's tiresome.  Three Alabama ""rebel orphans"" take a freelance job to swipe a valuable kid from a crime kingpen.  After the heist they face armies of Texas bodyguards, armed biker chick prostitutes, spiked leather black guys, and Indian archers.  All that's missing is ninjas with throwing stars.  Even Billy Bob can't lift this cheese off the ground."
"&#34;If I can't have him no one can.&#34; When Celeste (Longoria) wants to get her son back from her abusive ex Carlod (Thornton) she turns to three redneck brothers. Taking him back was easy, avoiding the odd gangs that are after them proves to be a little tougher. This is yet another movie where my expectations were apparently way to high. Also this is another movie where they put two big stars on the poster, but not really in the movie. They are in it more then Bruce Willis seems to be in his movies lately but they both did about 3 days of work each. Other then that the movie is a little boring. Really full of action and comedy but I had a hard time getting into this. I'm not sure what was missing because I usually like movies like this but I really couldn't get into this. Overall, I was very disappointed by this, was hoping for something more exciting. I give it a C+"
I could not stand any of these characters at all just annoying low life people that just did dumb things for no reason at all. If it wasn't because of that it would be an alright alien movie. The alien was kinda cool looking and the effects weren't too bad. The overall setting and atmospherewas that good either and just felt like a rushed movie for some reason. Not a fan but that's just me and there are way better alien movies out there. If your bored than I guess check it out.
"At least that's what they attempted.  But it doesn't really scare and it doesn't really make any sense.  Now, I'm thinking my rating may have been too high.  Is it a government conspiracy?  Is it a love story?  Is it an extra-terrestrial takeover? Is it a story about a phobia of toy dogs?  Yeah, it was watchable.  And this could have been a really good movie had the writers taken one of those ideas (maybe not the toy dog phobia) and stuck with it.  Bascially something falls from the sky into a storage center.  Conviently, the people at the center are locked into it because of a malfunctioning chain link gate.  And now the story gets falls off the rails.  Starting with the silly woman walking her dog who decides to investigate the fallen metal container.  Men in Black in cars suddenly show up, only to never be seen again.  Oh, nothing happens to them, the writers decided not to use them anymore.  So we're introduced to the love broken guy from Dr. Who and his best friend, who he finds out later... well, you'll see.  Throw in an old coot who's squatting in one of the storage pods, a creepy basement, toy dogs and fireworks, air ducts (a la ALIEN), a twist in the love story, and a creature that looks like a cross between the Predator and a dinosaur.  Actually, something you might see in a more intelligent version of Dr Who.  And at the end, you're waiting for the good Doctor to show up to rescue you from whatever is the new plot that the writers have devised. Actually, it looks like something they stole from 2010's Skyline, which is an even worse alien invasion movie.  But it's too late for this plot because the credits start rolling. The cast deserves better than this and so do you."
"The story is poor, the acting is fair, the monster is laughable, and even the broader scope of there being an alien invasion of Earth rather than this being an isolated incident is not enough to make this film interesting. Don't bother!"
"[Contains mild spoilers]A military cargo plane crashes in Battersea. London, and because of the power failure, a group of people is trapped inside ""Storage 24,"" including Charlie (Noel Clarke, who also co-wrote) and his ex-girlfriend Shelly (Antonia Campbell-Hughes), as well as their friends Mark (Colin O'Donoghue) and Nikki (Laura Haddock). But it seems there is someone or something in the facilities, too, that is not very friendly to them.You have heard the same story somewhere before. You have seen a young lady with a dog that keeps barking at something in the dark. You have seen some gooey substance dripping from above. Imagine what follows these scenes and that's exactly what you get in ""Storage 24,"" a B sci-fi horror film that does these things in a lazier and less impressive way than, say, ""Alien,"" almost to the point of a parody.But the film's greatest problem is neither the familiar premise nor the cheesy effects; it is those annoying characters about whom I didn't care. I honestly cheered for the poor ""intruder"" that at least didn't keep whining throughout the story.In short, ""Storage 24"" is ""Skyline"" without special effects, or ""Attack the Block"" without humor."
"Tim really is a jerk.  When you have someone as great as Clate, you find a way to keep him.  The project probably cost one million dollars.  And they ended up with $17,000.  That is a huge failure, they lost more than 98% of their money.  They totally tore up everything, like the hill they washed away and the jungle they made a road through.  And for what?  For less than a pound of gold?  The real gold is the TV royalties!  If you're going to contrive a show, at least do it well."
"After watching several of these gold-hunter shows, I've come to thank God repeatedly that I don't work for some stupid jerk boss (like the jackass in this show) who thinks its ok to run people into the ground, endanger their lives, violate safety practices at every turn, (OSHA/MSHA would have a field day if this happened in the US!!!)  and flat out doesn't care if they live or die.  I pray these workers find suitable employment elsewhere."
"""A Little Bit Zombie"" is what happens when fans of a movie make a movie.  Look, we all love ""Evil Dead"" - or to be precise, we all really love ""Evil Dead II"" because anyone who watches the first installment and expects the hilarious humor of the sequel is in for the shock of their lives - but there's a fine line between an homage and a lame copy.  Unfortunately ""A Little Bit Zombie"" is a little bit in the latter category.The plot, such as it is, centers on HR manager Steve (Kristopher Turner) who is marrying salon stylist and high maintenance fianc&eacute;e Tina (Crystal Lowe).  There's just one problem: Steve's sister and maid of honor Sarah (Kristen Hager) hates Tina, and it's easy to see why.  Fortunately, Steve's best friend Craig (Shawn Roberts) is also Sarah's husband and is there to provide moral support. Things take a turn for the hilarious when Steve is bitten by a zombie mosquito and slowly begins to turn into a cannibalistic brain-eater.  Hunted by a magic orb-wielding hottie Penelope (Emilie Ullerup) and crotchety shotgun-wielding Max (Stephen McHattie), it seems our fun foursome are about to experience a very bad weekend in the woods.The cast is a problem. Turner is passable as a normal guy just trying doing his best to avoid nibbling on his friends' brains, but Lowe is pretty bad in a role that requires her to carry much of the humor.  Her inability to keep up with Hager of ""Being Human"" fame is apparent - the roles could easily have been reversed, as there's more chemistry between Hager and Turner than there is between Turner and Lowe.  Ew.The zombie hunters aren't much better. McHattie plays Max as a psychopath who will blow anything up at a moment's notice, which is probably supposed to be funnier than it is.  For a great example of McHattie's talent put to good use against zombies, see ""Pontypool."" Blonde bombshell Ullerup speaks her lines with her usual wide-eyed wooden acting - if you've seen her turn as Ashley Magnus in ""Sanctuary,"" you know what to expect here.Fortunately, ""A Little Bit Zombie"" doesn't take itself too seriously.  Yes, the homages to ""Evil Dead"" are over the top, from the shed scene to the chuckle-worthy evil-point-of-view-cam, but the film's heart is in the right place even if it the script doesn't hit most of the comedy beats. The ending is appropriately off-key and at least ironic enough to make it worth sticking with the film.""A Little Bit Zombie"" isn't very gory, isn't very funny, and isn't very good - but then it isn't trying to be.  It's just a little bit of all three that makes it a passable entry in the zombie humor genre."
"All one need look at is the prevalence of Oprah Winfrey evolving into her own network (OWN, indeed!) to realize that women&#8217;s issue matter in the burgeoning world of pop culture.  And I say that as a man!  Women have their own unique struggles, they have their own unique baggage, much of which gets passed down from generation to generation.  They cross that threshold from childhood to adulthood.  They bear children.  They send their boys and girls off to fight wars.  They experience their own hateful form of peer pressure from girl-to-girl that probably gives them nightmares on up in through menopause.Despite the fact that commercial advertising has told you that you&#8217;ve come a long way, baby, maybe we as a society haven&#8217;t gone far enough?  That&#8217;s some of what&#8217;s in the heart of SAVING GRACE B. JONES, a period piece tearjerker brought to you by living legend, Connie Stevens.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)For nearly 20 years, Grace (played by the incomparable Tatum O&#8217;Neal) has resided in the care of a state asylum for the insane.  Her brother, Landy (the reliable Michael Biehn), finally secures her release, and he&#8217;s bound and determined to bring her home to live with his wife, Bea (Penelope Ann Miller) and child.  However, secrets never die in Small Town America, and while the townfolks are more involved with stopping the mounting flood waters Grace won&#8217;t hold back her own dire emotions in this tale laced with jilted love and misplaced affection.The good?  I love seeing Michael Biehn in practically anything, and his turn as the small-town baker here is pretty solid.  (Granted, he&#8217;ll never quite look the part, but he does what he&#8217;s paid to do!)  Also, I could sit and watch Penelope Ann Miller read the label of a mayonnaise jar because I&#8217;m that interested in watching her work.  Lastly, there&#8217;s a great roundtable of young actresses in this that are clearly destined to have some very good careers.  Writer/director Connie Stevens has put together a winning ensemble around Tatum O&#8217;Neal that looks and sounds pretty spiffy.The bad?  Well, it just wasn&#8217;t all that interesting.  Maybe that says more about me as a viewer and a critic than it does the film, but, for all of the posturing, whining, and moaning in this Peyton Place kinda/sorta wannabe, I just didn&#8217;t feel all that motivated.  Inspired.  Or interested.Now, that may speak to Connie Stevens&#8217; weaknesses as a storyteller.  In a career that spanning nearly seven decades (you read that right), she&#8217;s best known as a luscious blonde with terrific comic timing.  FYI: this is only her second screenplay, and it&#8217;s based on a true story.  I tend to think that something was lost in the adaptation process that maybe a more learned, more experienced scriptwriter could&#8217;ve positively affected &#8211; namely, emotional journeys that resonate for all of the characters and not so few.  Of course, I&#8217;m not questioning the relevance of the subject matter, as even today societies around the world continue to struggle with how to confront mental illness.  By this film&#8217;s tragic conclusion, I thought I was losing my mind trying to keep it all together.As much as I wanted to enjoy GRACE, in the end I thought it was a bit of a narrative mess, not unlike Grace&#8217;s own fragile mind.  Not enough of it made perfect sense, but I couldn&#8217;t force myself to look away, even when I tried.  Exceptional performances across the board just weren&#8217;t enough to make this world come alive the way it should.SAVING GRACE B. JONES (2009) is produced by Shane Productions.  DVD distribution is being handled by Arc Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications?  This is one smartly shot period drama (1940&#8217;s/1950&#8217;s), and it works very well from start to finish though there was one sequence wherein it was blatantly obvious actor Scott Wilson&#8217;s dialogue was dubbed in post-production.  Lastly, I&#8217;d be remiss in my duties if I failed to point out that the film and actresses were highly decorated as part of the 2012 New York City International Film Festival, and the feature won &#8216;Best Dramatic Feature&#8217; at the 2011 Los Angeles Women&#8217;s International Film Festival.  Kudos to all involved.  Unfortunately, the disc offers no special features to speak of.INTERESTING but it&#8217;s honestly still HARD TO RECOMMEND.  At 116 minutes, SAVING GRACE B. JONES is just too darn long.  It&#8217;s clear to see why this is a favorite of critics &#8211; it indicts small-town America for something the entire world has difficulty with, and that&#8217;s recognizing not only how to deal with deep-rooted psychological problems but also how to deal with them &#8211; and critics love to see America brought to its knees.  At best, JONES is the kind of film that might be worthy of film club study; otherwise, it&#8217;s pretty easy to see why this one took so long to find a distributor to the masses at large.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Arc Entertainment provided me with a DVD copy of SAVING GRACE B. JONES by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it."
My wife and I found this movie to be quite boring.  It seemed like it would never end.
"Apparently this movie is based on a true story. It is a depressing story and one that in my opinion,did not need to be told."
"PLOT SPOILER REVIEW.This is based on a true story: Connie Stevens once read a Steinbeck novel. The beginning of the film introduces Carrie, a 10 year old girl (Rylee Fansler) whose function is to supply some needless narration. She is not a major character in the film and I kept wondering how she was going to fit into the scope of things with Grace (Tatum O'Neal).Landy (Michael Biehn) has the patience of a saint as he takes in Carrie and decides now would be a good time to get his &#34;crazy&#34; sister to come home against the wishes of the asylum. Grace causes issues, not unlike a Steinbeck novel we all know and love. The film introduces religion into the film which didn't seem to have a point, as did the film itself.The film was long and slow. It was like watching the rain come down...which we did. The adult performances were spectacular. Michael Biehn was  unrecognizable from his normal &#34;B' acting role. Tatum was Oscar worthy consideration. The girls left something to be desired. Too bad Dakota Fanning had to grow up.Overall, this was a tiresome film by Connie Stevens, who I enjoy more in front of the camera than behind.No F-bombs or nudity. Brief sex/love scene."
"there are some pretty good episodes in this season, but the only thing is it is the same exact one's they show on cable, I hate that I spend money on this, its season 25 and they only have like seasons 19-25, what the hell happened to the first 18 seasons then??? that's ridiculous seriouslyevery week I remember one of my new or old favorite tv shows that I want to watch so I come onto amazon to buy the season....after this bull though, im done, not going to be buying anything from amazon streaming anymore now.amazon wants to be so stupid and cheap to have seasons 19-25 but not the first 18, that's what happens when your cheap!! people leave and take their money with them"
too boring ... after 4 or 5 episodes ... gave up and just watched the last one which i fast forwarded through anywayThe stories are just dumb and dumber ... actually ended up rooting for Ava and Boyd .These &#34;good guy&#34; people are too mean including Winnona AND the religious freak who conned the public herself.
"Each season seems to get more violent and profane and I question if it is really necessary.  The staging is superb and Raylon is a true hero in his job, but we really don't have to see the steamy bedroom scenes to know that he is one sexy dude.  We swore off for a while to let them cool down but go back from time to time to see another edition.  Glad I don't have kids I'm trying to shield from all this obscenity.  Even so, it is still excellent drama."
This is a live aquarium with real fish and loud bubbling noise.  Nothing wrong with watching fish live but they tend to be shy and inactive.  I'll have to admit that if I want an aquarium on my computer or TV screen I would rather have the animated variety - it's much more interesting.
Why isn't the episode from last night not here yet? I have been noticing it more and more that the tv shows that you buy from here are starting to take longer and longer to get:(
"I have no idea why I watch this show, probably for the same reason people start at train wrecks.  It revolves around this dysfunctional dance teacher, Abby Lee Miller, who, despite her personality flaws, seems to be very good at watch she does because she produces beautiful, winning dances for her competitive dancing team as well as some of her individual dancers. She favors two sisters over the rest of the group.  The older one is definitely talented, but one wonders if she's more successful in competitions because she gets so much more time and attention from Abby than the other girls.  That's mostly because the mother is the typical brown-noser we've all known and disliked at some point in our lives.  The Dance Moms are dysfunctional personalities like Abby.  I don't understand why they have not all (except the one mentioned previously) been arrested for child abuse for exposing their children to Abby's mistreatment.  They are all dumber than boxes of rocks. One even has a Ph.D, but apparently not a lot of common sense. (On one episode, one of the moms didn't know who Ann Frank was).  The moms fight Abby, fight among themselves, fight a competing dance teacher (as does Abby) and the whole thing is really a hot mess.  The main reason I like to watch it is to see the girls dance.  The girls are the best thing about the show. They all seem to be sweet, lovely, and talented, which makes the Moms even more culpable for putting up with the treatment Abby dishes out.  One has to wonder if the money is really worth destroying the self-confidence (which anyone with children can see is happening) of these charming young girls. It makes me glad my daughter was into sports."
"This is one of the 'must pass' shows of the season. Bill Pullman plays the president in a comedy ensemble--trying to convince viewers that the 'First Family' also has problems like other Americans.It would be a great premise, except the scripts really suck. In the pilot, the eldest son Skip Gilchrist Jr. (Josh Gad) manages to get himself booted from college. Not only that, but the audiences are supposed to actually believe that in the 21st century, these pyrotechnic exploits would not make the 24-hour and international news cycle. Somehow everything is kept esentially hush-hush. It's dropped after the pilot?Since Skip's higher education career essentially ended, he's now trying to help out dad. He does this by unwittingly botching a tennis game which dad was supposed to let the visiting elected official win. Again, no concept of reality. If the President knows about diplomacy, he is not going to let his idiot clown son screw up a social event. Appearances do matter.I wonder who had connections at the network to authorize this series?"
This is one of my few negative comments because Taken 2 has been out long enough that it should be offered for streaming with prime. This extended preview was a mistake. I thought it was the real show disappointing.
"because I dislike when villains leave the hero conveniently alone so the hero can escape.  And how about when the Liam Neeson character was about to be taken captive and the villains kindly allowed him to place a telephone call.  Filmmakers need to make smarter villains.  There were what twenty villains, and they were all looking at telly or sleeping, when their job was to be guarding Liam and his ex-wife; how do villains keep their job if they do it so poorly - not believable they were all so inept.  I did like the use of the daughter, I think she has the makings of an agent herself and hope that future sequels pursue that story line.  Dislike the editing, cut so choppily I could barely tell what's happening during the fight sequences.  Two and a half stars.Final thoughts: I think the Liam Neeson character needs to train his ex-wife/daughter so they at least have some defensive skills, as often as not one or both are in the thick of things in these films.  What if the Liam character gets shot; it'd be great if the women could take care of themselves or maybe even rescue him should he ever need it. Having everybody strong, including the women, would be great to see."
"This show proves that Staten Island, NY is a vast intellectually defunct wasteland. Its stupid funny watch only if you have time to kill"
"If anyone gave this movie 5 stars they are definitely a high teenager.  This is bound to be one of those cheesy cult classics in 10 years, but for now it's just terrible.  The story was okay but the acting was awful and comedy was a joke (that pun is funnier than anything in the movie).  I rolled the dice on this movie because of Paul Giamatti who is awesome, but he is only in this movie for like 7 minutes (the best 7 minutes).  He was also the producer of the film (why?).This one has crappy special effects, B and C actors, and is a waste of $3.99.  Trust me - pick something else."
"This is a film for those that are easily entertained.It's just weird how movies like ""Red Lights"" that require the viewer to think and use a bit of critical thinking skills to tie the plot together will get bombed reviews because it makes people think. Then you have mindless ""coloring book"" styled movies like this get high praise from the masses. I say coloring book because it doesn't make you think or give you a reason to use your brain. As long as you stay inside the lines the picture will come out the way it's supposed to look, better yet even if you go outside the lines the picture will come out the way it's supposed to look because it's already defined for you. That is what these kinds of movies are like. You just sit down and watch them then it ends. I've seen that shift a lot in movies lately where movies that make the viewer ""think"" get bashed or end up with comments like ""I didn't get it"", ""I don't understand"", ""I have some questions?"". People really don't like to think anymore when they watch movies****(I'm not basing my rating on my observations I note above)****As for this movie it just wasn't to my taste. Movies that try to be awkward but don't carry any depth to them aren't my cup of tea. If you could compare this movie it's like Men In Black meets Harold and Krumar go to White Castle with a bit of Scott Pilgrim tied in (except Scott Pilgrim had a deeper message to it that only thinking people caught). If you're looking for that kind of movie of quirky action movie. You have to have a certain kind of sense of humor to enjoy this film (toilet humor). That's all that really can be said about the movie. Plot wise it's about 2 men that find themselves captivated by a drug that allows them to have unique abilities to see and know things what the rest of us don't. The two men take up the role to be like the M.I.B. to these outer worldly creatures."
"No monster Dave??!?!?  Really?!??!  That's, like, sort of the entire point of JDATE.  Sure, JDATE is full of exposition for the rest of the series, and it's also hilarious, strange, and terrifying.  But the big payoff in JDATE is the fact that Dave is NOT Dave by the end!  Why even bother with the axe story in the beginning if they're not going to use it for a reason?The lack of monster Dave is not the only problem with this adaptation.  Many characters, plot lines, and locations were cut.  The final product is a mishmash of scenes that don't make sense.  I can't even care about this movie.  I certainly don't care about the characters or plot.  It's disgusting that such fantastic source material could yield such an abomination.John was good, though."
"So this movie is like hallucinating on Ambien while watching some children's horror movie.  It is scattered and overly silly.  Plainly, it is just a dumb film not worth watching till the end.  Although, I do in fact hope that all the characters die in the end.  I stopped watching it after its incoherent, flopping scenes just made no sense.  This movie had a chance to be entertaining.  It had good effects, a couple interesting and weird ideas, but it is a lot of trouble to get through.Not recommended, unless you frequently read Goosebumps books while on Ambien."
I used to really like Dual Survival but the new season with Joe Teti SUCKS.He maybe a great special ops man but Stinks at this just way to arrogant. mikyle Hawks would have been a better pick. Or better yet whatever the controversy is with Dave Canterbury(and yes we've all heard big deal) could have been overcome like the whole Bear Grills thing if someone at discovery hadn't freaked. AS is show is not worth watching anymore let alone buy.whole show is headed toward oblivion if discovery doesn't do something fast.And that would be a sad loss.
"Kroll is a genius when he taps his comedic talents correctly.  Unfortunately, this show does not do him any justice.  The skits are absurd and ludicrous, but never funny.  Just amusing.  The characters are more annoying and off-putting than they are fun to watch.There are a few skits that will make you laugh, but most of the season is just a waiting game: waiting for something to be funny.  Unlike his character on the League, who is ALWAYS funny, this show's offerings are pretty lame.I recommend you watch The League instead."
The show itself I would give a 2-3 stars for content. I guess it is just not my thing so much drama but it is a reality show so what do you think you are going to get. My problem is the video always skips or freezes. I got so sick of it I had to turn it off. It was not my internet conection of TV it is the show I have tried it a few other places and had the same issue.
"Deep beneath the Australian Outback lies Area 52, a secret research facility that the government doesn't want you to know about. Here, experiments in human biomechanics have unleashed the ultimate weapon... And one that Australia's top special forces agents will be unprepared to face as they enter the facility on a seek and destroy mission! CRAWLSPACE attempts to combine CUBE's suffocating mood with the psychological terror of PATRICK or THE SENDER, although it falls short in either department. Writer/Director Justin Dix relies far too heavily on a twist ending which has been blatantly broadcast from very early on. This makes for very little suspense and minimal guesswork as the audience wades through an all-too-familiar plot and predictable characters. CRAWLSPACE does come through with a few commendable moments of supreme tension as the characters face their darkest fears within the close confines of the tunnels, but these are short-lived. The added gore, claustrophobic sets, and winning make-up designs do work to the film's advantage as well, however. With a stronger character base and a greater exploration of the villain's near-limitless powers, CRAWLSPACE may have had more room to succeed, but it becomes easily trapped by its own narrow aspirations.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
Jr high setting.  Entertaining in a weird way but too juvinile to watch a whole series.  Reminiscent of 80s movies
"Just couldn't hold my interest. They didn't convince me that they had found the perfect diet. In fact, I couldn't even finish watching it."
"I watched this movie and dang it, there was something that was ""off""  it appeared to me to be very light on science and such but very heavy on propaganda.  Certain regions of the world were entirely missing from the ""studies"" so how can that be definite proof?One has to wonder about cherry picking to achieve certain ""results"" is that science or ???? Oh yeah, if you actually read the end credits and then web search those names the majority have ties to the meat industry as currently operating in the USA.While I don't hate this movie, I do feel that it is misleading in several areas and that it actually does a disservice to those who are actively seeking accurate information."
"It's hard to tell whether ""A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III"" is a good-natured bit of self-parody on the part of Charlie Sheen, poking fun at his reputation as a compulsive womanizer, or a vanity project designed to showcase the actor's now-legendary sexual prowess and playboy image. I suspect it's the former, but even if it's the latter, it still doesn't make for a very entertaining movie.In plot, the movie feels an awful lot like a full-length version of ""Californication,"" as a middle-aged, sunglass-wearing Angeleno laments how he's screwed up with the love of his life (Ivana played by Ketheryn Winnick) because he's never grown up enough to stay committed to a monogamous relationship.Writer/director Roman Coppola's eclectic, scattershot approach alternates between scenes set in reality - or a close proximity thereof - and wild, but surprisingly flatfooted fantasy sequences heavy on op and pop visuals and graphics (Charlie is himself a successful graphics designer) and light on originality and cleverness. Apparently, there's not really all that much worth taking a glimpse of in ole Charlie's mind after all. Indeed, despite a big name cast that includes Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman and Patricia Arquette, the movie feels an awful lot like a third-rate film school project that somehow got green-lighted by an actual studio."
"On the plus side, this is a very tightly and professionally put together film. It's well edited, reasonably well structured, and contains a lot of footage from Hollywood A-listers (and some I would consider B-listers) telling their stories and giving their perspectives. Another plus is that the paparazzi too are given a chance to tell their side of the story.But on the down side, unless you've been living under a rock for the last 15 years or so, it contains little if anything that you won't have heard before. And yes, I really do mean many, many times before.Paparazzi, high price of fame, invasion of privacy, telephoto lenses, people's homes, Princess Dianna, Paris Hilton, Kim Kardashian, it didn't used to be like this back when the studios ran things, sometimes the celebs or their agents set these things up themselves, the people buying the gossip mags or visiting the gossip websites bear ultimate responsibility...Won't somebody please think of the children...You know the drill.I originally titled this review ""Nothing You Haven't Heard Many, Many Times Before"". But then I realized that wasn't entirely true. It did tell the story of how back when the studios ran things, one magazine got info on Rock Hudson's homosexuality. It then went to his studio and basically said ""give us something better or we'll run this"". The studio then offered up another, far less prominent (and less profitable) homosexual actor on a platter, who was subsequently outed in the magazine and had his career ruined. Why the magazine went with this instead of doing the Rock Hudson piece isn't entirely clear, but anyway, that's the story. It takes up about a minute of screen time, and is literally the only thing in this film you might not have heard about before.As for the rest... It's not that I really disagree with anything this film has to say. It's just that like I keep saying, we've heard it all SO many times before.Given the almost total absence anything we're not all already completely familiar with (if not to say positively drenched in), I'd have to describe this work as what William Gibson prophetically called a ""meta-tabloid"" in his novelVirtual Light, published way back in 1994.Great book, by the way. Time spent reading that would be far better used than the time it takes to watch this.Theo."
omigod - I don't know if it is the lead actress's waxy skin or her waxy acting but she always looks like she is eager to be a hooker or something despite being an instant farm girl or whatever her clean as a whistle background is supposed to be.  I did enjoy Ivy's veteran nervousness but this is altogether a very creepy show EXPERTLY acted.  I don't understand the point of this show at all.  I thought at first it would be a launchpad for an actual Broadway show that would have guaranteed sales from fans of the show but I really doubt it now.  It's just a terrible and expensive embarassing show.  If only it was fun to watch in its awfulness.
"The first season was fun with the cast and all of it's musical numbers, now its just blah.  The music is still fun (most of the time) but most of the new cast was just not good ..."
"The show is an awesome broadway drama, but it has been canceled and no one likes cliff hangers not too be continued."
So we need another movie like this?  The only reason I rented it was because others had given such good reviews.
"Honestly, I should give this movie 3-stars, because it's okay. It isn't bad, but i take a star away for what it isn't. It is a movie about a college professor vampire who thought the love of his life died hundreds of years ago until she walks onto his campus. So this professor, and inexplicably the student, played by the beautiful and the Hollywood underused Julie Gonzalo, get the hots for each other and start having an affair. There is absolutely NOTHING hot about this affair. In fact, through the entire movie, the sex talk is rampant, yet there is nothing remotely HOT about the entire thing.To make matters worse, they also cast the incredibly hot Alexis Knapp (Pitch Perfect, Project X) in the movie and she is barely used as well. So, you have Gonzalo, Knapp, a student having an affair with her professor and a sorority full of girls, constant sex talk, vampires attacking parties, an entire sorority of girls becoming vampires and NONE OF IT is actually shown. None of it. It is the most frustrating movie EVER. It is the blue-balls of movies.Vampires. Sorority girls. Sex. Gonzalo. Knapp. Yet, it was filmed in a way that it could safely air on DISNEY CHANNEL; if it weren't for all the sex talk and cussing. Man I really like Julie Gonzalo and I'm really glad that she's getting parts. I just wish that somebody would give her something good. I give this movie 2-stars for the fact that Gonzalo is walking and talking in it, otherwise, it is the most confusing movie ever. There is a cuss word every two minutes, but the creators apparently thought that any sort of violence or sex was WRONG!!"
"Disappointed they virtually ignored the black artist.  With so many young black children needing inspiration, to know that there are more doors than rap open to them, it is important that respect and recognition be shown.  Very disappointed."
I don't know but I just found the whole concept too preposterous and superficial in its depiction of violence and suspense. It just seems like it wants to shock you because it has to compete with other cable shows that are much more successful in their execution of similar edgy material. I'm not feeling the hero or the villain in this setup. Way too contrived for my tastes.
"I had high hopes for a series with Kevin Bacon, and his acting really is fine in this series. However, I avoid programs with plots about sick, perverted people doing disgusting, unnatural things to other people (very often women) -- shoes such as Criminal Minds and The Fall, do this too. My nightmares are fed adequately with my own imagination; I don't need someone else's perspective to muddy up the id."
"I really like the TV show ""Dark Minds.""  It's one of those rare shows that I really look forward to the next episode, kind of like ""The X Files"" a long time ago, at least before that show went off the rails in its last couple of seasons.  I really like the interplay between M. William Phelps and John Kelly; I always get a really good chuckle when 13, or Raven, makes some mysterious comment and either the author or profiler looks up at the other in dismay.I just read part of a review, written by Raven, of the show ""The Following.""  Now, for those of you who haven't seen ""Dark Minds,"" Raven is the pseudonym of the real-life serial killer who helps Mr. Phelps and Mr. Kelly during profiling sessions.  Raven is now behind bars, but he is allowed 15 minutes a call, to give an opinion on some unsolved crime.  Now, if anyone knows what he's talking about when it comes to serial killers, it would be Raven.  After all, practice makes perfect.  And evidently, he's had a lot of practice.  And I was very happy to see that Raven hates ""The Following"" nearly as much as I.I watched the first episode of ""The Following"" and only made it through the first half.  Raven turned it off after 40 minutes.  To me, the biggest problem with this faade-of-a-serial-killer-show:  everyone is in constant crisis mode.  The real world doesn't work this way.  People have down time; they drink coffee every once in a while!  But watching Kevin Bacon -- and his coworkers here -- you'd think they're all on speed.  Man, I say:  kick it down a notch every once in a while!  There are other issues, but this issue alone is sufficient to make me change the channel.One issue that I had with Raven's analysis:  he said that serial killers don't engage the police.  Now, that is usually the case; most serial killers are smart enough to avoid attention.  However, what about killers such as Zodiac?  He is one of quite a few that seemed to enjoy toying with the police.  But otherwise, I liked Ravens critique of ""The Following,"" a show that I won't be following at all, just like Raven.But I will be following ""Dark Minds.""  I guess the season ends this week.  Bummer.  Well, I can watch one more show and then I'll have to wait until fall for the next episode.  I'd recommend following ""Dark Minds,"" and dumping ""The Following"" from your queue.  You won't be following unwatchable TV that way."
Wish he had better writers and co-stars.
"For the first few episodes, my wife and I were really enjoying it. Then, well, it dawned on us that the FBI was more stupid about things than we would have been, or any cops on any TV show we've ever seen would've been, or even Barney Fife would've been. They don't screen people to see who has visited the villain, which would sort of be an easy thing to do. It would give them a short list of suspects, wouldn't it?They have a never-ending string of folks to serve the same purpose as the red shirts on away teams for the original Star Trek series. Hanging out with Ryan is certain death for any character you've never seen before. Bad guys show up everywhere. 90% of the people Ryan has ever spoken to seems to be a part of this cult... yet they won't just scour the prison visitor logs? Half of the law enforcement community seems to be in the cult. It didn't take long for this to get to be a bit silly.Finally, some members of the cult itself are portrayed as ""Constitutional Radicals"". There is a ""Don't Tread on Me"" flag on the wall of the cult's training camp. Seriously? This show is about people who love the US Constitution who happen to really like to kill people? Where did that come from? It's nonsense, and it is the straw that broke the camel's back for me.I love the acting and the casting is awesome. Too bad the writers haven't the brains to make the story credible and to keep their socialistic bias in check."
"I think this series is the main cause of why my blood pressure is escalating whenever I pay attention to it. I was never fond of Police/Investigation/Crime shows except for a few here and there. My friend insisted this was a good show to watch and don't get me wrong for the first 5 or so episodes it was thrilling and engaging but it doesn't take long for the viewer to realize that the plots just keep dragging on and on and are quite repetitive. In short the fault doesn't lie with the actors but with the plot itself, it's ridiculous even for a TV show.Joe Carrol a former college professor, is well the villain the title ""The Following"" is based on his ability to reach out for those unloved/unwanted/outcast civilians who also suffer from a disease called psychopathy or otherwise known in today's pop culture Psycho. He more or less uses these people to form an organization that's going to follow his lead of serial murders, kidnappings, torture and all the inhuman activities ever invented to help him write the greatest novel alive which will be based on the real life of these murders. Not Only that he also chooses Ryan Hardy the former FBI agent who had an affair with Joe Carrol's ex wife and was the reason behind his capture a couple of years ago to be the patroness of this great work of literature that he's preparing. But that's not the point. The Point is the bad people are all intellects, sophisticated, dominating, sneaky and have a good strategy. While the good guys on the other hand, are hopeless and by hopeless I mean they can't do anything to save their lives and as a ramification of that the bad guys keep winning over and over while the good once lose everything.I just got bored, the endless killings of civilians in the name of this literally work while no one's able to catch them in the act is a tad unbelievable. The ability of Joe Carrol to brain wash as many people to join him in his little killing spree is just unrealistic and strange especially when we come to realize he was doing it while he was behind bars through the internet? Seriously! Come Join me in my quest of criminal activties and you'll get a chapter in my upcoming book! Yeah, no one will buy that!The minions are pathetic, losers who killed their (-------) and ran away with it cause the authorities are so dumb to catch them especially when they're already suspects entering a freaking Jail to visit a death row criminal who's responsible for the killing of 14 young girls. Did You get that? He's a mass murder and still gets unlimited jail visit times to interview his minions.Just, don't let me go any further I could go on and on and on about how stupid and impossible this situation would be in real life but I don't think my ramblings will end.Not to mention, he escapes prison again! and his followers fly him through a helicopter don't ask me how they afforded it unless they killed it's passengers to a huge mansion where he'll be crowned as their King. If this was happening in some medieval legend I might have bought that but in the real world in modern times with all this technology?I don't really know what the writers of this show are trying to portray by doing all of this? Is it for the sake of entertainment alone? Cause if it is let me tell you it's quite repetitive. Unless the writers have this hate for the FBI and just want to portray them as useless then fine. Whatever!I don't think I'll be watching the following season. What a waste of great potential!"
"What can I say?  I really was expecting more from a series that had Kevin Bacon and James Purefoy in it.  I love both of those actors and I'm a big fan of E.A. Poe, so I really was looking forward to this.  Unfortunately, I was unimpressed."
"I've watched 3 episodes and can feel some of the storylines a mile away.  Just wait until they reveal that the young FBI agent is a follower. Couldn't see that one coming.This is just more romanticizing death and gore, elevating the serial killer as a genius.  I can't imagine a plot twist that would be engaging enough to ""follow"" this program through 12 more episodes.Even the marvelous Kevin Bacon can't save the show. I wish he could because it's been too long since we've seen him on the screen.  This role is too one dimensional for him.  There's no emotional rangei in the role.  All he gets to do is grimace his way through the episodes as the tortured hero. Snore."
"Watched it for FREE on Netflix. I usually look for a show there before I buy on Amazon. Netflix NEVER has all seasons of ANY show & never current episodes. Amazon does, however, have ALL episodes of every series they sell the day after they air  on TV. Well anyway.... I watched season 1 there,if it were any good I would have bought season 2 on Amazon but this show was NOT good. I gave it 2-Stars because it DID keep me from being bored to death while I was working. So 2-Satrs is me being &#34;nice&#34;.Too much in this series annoyed me. Like how useless law enforcement was. So many idiotic mistakes & unrealistic behavior. Several FBI agents were kidnapped. How does this happen? One of them KNEW something was up (right before they snatched him up) and didn't respond the way someone with FBI TRAINING should have. He just scurried on up to his hotel room like a scared civilian frantically trying to open his hotel room door. I said &#34;They're gonna be in his room. Watch!&#34;, then *BAM* soon as he walks in the cult members are in his room waiting. Too predictable. The &#34;bad guys&#34; kept getting away! Even in situations where there's no way in hell they should have. In a hostage situation, since WHEN does FBI, SWAT, Local law enforcement leave (or pretend to leave) when the bad guys demand them to do so? How do 3 guys take out 3 dozen FBI agents with ease? Why do the &#34;bad guys&#34; ALWAYS get away by sneaking out the back door when the house/building is supposedly surrounded by cops? Even with a police officer RIGHT THERE in the hallway outside of Clair's bedroom (while her door was open) a FAT cult member slowly drops out of the ceiling (like Spider Man) kills the cop with out making a peep then takes her hostage..... Really!?Joe Carrol & Clair's son, was a smart-DUMB kid. One minute the kids does something extremely clever, the next minute he does something extremely dumb (even for a kid).The main thing that irked me is..... No one behaved as if an infinite number of anonymous serial-killer-cult-members were running around killing random innocent people,blowing up stuff, kidnapping kids/women, and kidnapping & torturing FBI. No one was taking this seriously enough for me. Like when Ryan & Claire were held up at his FBI friend's cabin. Soon as they found that a GPS tracking device was planted on Claire (by a cult member) they should have LEFT IMMEDIATELY. Instead they stay and plan on leaving in the next day (WTF!?) in the meantime Ryan's friend finds ONE shot gun and a half-empty box of shells. Mind you, they know that they're being hunted by select cult members with extreme military/C.I.A training (and military grade fire power) that just murdered 3 dozen FBI agents an hour ago. Of course, soon as night falls here comes the bad guys AGAIN.The one victim that survived being attacked by Joe Carrol (forgot her name) didn't act like someone who just found out the serial killer that almost stabbed her to death just broke out of prison. This girl (and her friends) acted like she just lost her cat/dog and was a little bummed out over it. If that were me...After the attack, I would've already had an arsenal in my home. After being notified Joe Carrol escaped, I wouldn't take a piss without a 9mm (loaded with hollow-points) sitting on the vanity. I would've purchased two highly trained German Shepard dogs, that would've slept in bedroom every night. I also would've spent the last 7 yrs doing some type of NavySeals/C.I.A/JasonBorne combat training, and at the riffle range 5 days a week. This is the type of behavior you'd expect from someone that had gone through such a tragic ordeal.Police protection or &#34;Protective Custody&#34; is a JOKE in every low budget movie/series. Am I supposed to be surprised that the 50 cops outside & inside of the victim's home wasn't going to stop the &#34;bad guys&#34; from getting to them? Hasn't this scenario been done to death in movies?DISCLAIMER: Being that Amazon &#34;comments section&#34; is becoming too much like YouTube comments due to ignorant people with no lives, I have to make this disclaimer. F_ _ _ YOU in advance to anyone that feels the need to criticize my review, as well other peoples review. I turned the &#34;notification&#34; feature off because I couldn't careless about anyone's feedback. So your stupid commentary WILL fall on deaf ears. So STFU in advance also. Have a good one : )"
"The characters are good, acting is good, however, this is a graphic, gory television show. The carnage detracts from the story. I wonder how long it will be before some sick person wanting attention starts to copy the crimes in shows like this one and Criminal Minds."
"Parts of his performance made me cringe they we so awful. He's a terrific actor, so I don't know what was happening here. He didn't have chemistry with any of the cast and the whole thing seemed awkward and forced. Pilots can be a little rough around the edges, so maybe this will get better with time. Overall, I'm didn't like it enough to make it 'appointment' TV."
This movie was so slow I had to turn it off. It had bad acting and the storyline was slow as molasses.
"I heard a whole lot of comparisons between this film andThe Cabin In The Woodsbefore I decided to give this one a try. And why not? The latter film is probably one of my top three favorite ""horror"" films of all time, and definitely the smartest nod to the genre I've ever witnessed, regardless of how funny or scary you think it is. This film, written long before CABIN IN THE WOODS, tries to approach that same level of wit and insight into the genre, but the problem is that the script is just too shoddy to pull it off.The film follows two gentlemen in a cabin in the woods (natch). One of them -- a young husband and father-to-be named Michael -- has come to visit Chris -- his old, estranged, meth-smoking friend -- in an attempt to finally wean him off of the drug. Michael takes an old-school approach to rehab, handcuffing his friend to a pipe and letting him sweat it out, and as the two bicker (with fairly repetitive and awkwardly curse-laden dialogue) and relive old times, strange pictures, films, books, and recordings begin popping up around the cabin. Where are these things coming from? What do they mean? Will Chris -- the healthiest-looking meth-addict you've ever seen (check out those biceps!) -- be able to kick his habit? Will Michael allow his own pride to blind himself to the fact that something seriously creepy-deepy is going on?The idea behind the film is great. I give it five stars. I don't even fault the film for its low-budget execution, which is pretty solid, all things considered. The film is a mediation on the art of story-telling, especially with regards to horror films, and its constant nods to various horror tropes -- aliens, strange disappearances, Native American burial grounds, ghosts, creepy religious types, foreign scientists -- is cute enough, but none of it is particularly compelling. Even when something pretty creepy does happen -- a mysterious person stares at our leads through the window or a recording of them appears unannounced -- one or both of the characters inexplicably doesn't care, which effectively neuters the response of the audience. If viewers are supposed to be yanked to the edges of their seats, so should our characters, and what they mainly do is just argue about drugs, friendship, and life.Not until the last twenty minutes of the film do things begin to gain some kind of steam, but it's an old fashioned case of too-little-too-late. By then, the bizarre occurrences of the film have become very obvious (i.e. heavy-handed) symbols. This is further hammered home by Michael's insistence on referring to every set of photos, every scratchy record, every cave painting as a ""story."" This kind of overdone symbolism is especially weird considering the film's general insistence on remaining aloof from the typical spoon-feeding you get from most scary films. Smart viewers will get what's going on, but there's bound to be a sizable chunk of the audience who will finish the movie and wonder, ""What was that last shot about?"" In case you missed Michael pounding it into the dialogue: it's about something, somewhere that wants a story.The trippiness of the overall story just doesn't hold enough water to compel the plot, is the problem. And in a movie that is all about the things that make a story worthwhile and that even cause stories to exist to begin with, it's a shame that the producers focused so much on creating a powerful ending without thinking about what it takes to have an equally powerful beginning and middle. As a result, you have a movie that's too smart for its britches, that seems to have been made backwards, with its strongest and greatest ideas placed at the end. But like a powerful anchor attached to sewing thread, this film's ending is stuck to an hour of quiet nonaction that is not particularly creepy, interesting, or even all that sensible (did I mention that our film's meth-head looks like he could be a lightweight boxing champion?), and so the density of the finale makes the preceding hour of movie seem even fluffier and more pointless than it already is, rendering the entire experience kind of a rip-off."
"I gave up after 45 minutes. Even bad movies I watch to the end, but this one was just weighing me down with the meandering and lack of action. This was recommended as horror, but I like actual horror and not paranormal."
"This character continued to act like a spoiled brat & even with a 'stellar cast' it just got to tiring to watch.  He didn't even change.  It just became wooded & let me be clear I'm talking about the lead's acting.  The father and all the others, a stellar cast, changed and grew.  They were effected by the events that transpired.  The lead did not."
"I don't mind suspending my hold on reality to enjoy a good show.  But this show asks too much.  These spies are so devoted to the &#34;mother country&#34; that they jeopardize their kids.  I'm sure Russians love their children, so what's up with this absurd notion?  Then they just happen to have a new neighbor who just happens to be an FBI agent recently back from deep cover and assigned to counterespionage.  I mean c'mon.  Then the scene in the garage getting the jumper cables out of the trunk where the hostage is lying bound and gagged for days and the agent gets close enough that the smell coming from that trunk would have knocked him over!  Then the spies dump a body in the drink and proceed to have sex at the scene!!!  And the ending was just plain ridiculous.  Seeing the husband spy in the shadows after the agent leaves his garage was laughable.  What's he live in there with his gun at the ready?  No thanks!  You have to do better than this."
This is a very good series but there seems to be a sex scene every few minutes of spies having sex with other spies etc. This takes away from the show and becomes very irritating.
"The show is entirely too graphic when it comes to the sex scenes and half of the show involves sex scenes.  Also, the show would much more fun if the star characters had a good relationship instead of what they have."
"Two things to consider when playing a spy.  Don;t act like one and do your homework on that particular country. This series is seriously horrible, rediculous and unbelievable.  Also, the sexual content has no redeeming features which is also known as a description of pornography.  A caveat to the producers and directors. If you don't know what you are talking about  don't put it in the script."
Didn't ever get past the second episode. Seemed a lot of it centered around sex scenes and talk.Don't recommend it.
"A potentially good story, good premise, however the producers once again succumbed to using &#34;lessons in how to perform sexually&#34; in order to capture the attentions of those who still need these lessons.  Oh, how I wish a story could be told without the explicit demonstrations of all types of perversions.  The British seem to be able to do so -  subtly, and often with humor.  I watched 3 episodes before getting sick of it."
"I loved the pilot, and I thought that I had found another Breaking Bad/Mad Men quality tv show. Great characters, plot, acting, etc. However, episode after episode after episode made me lose interest and my disgust for the characters increased. Now, I am about mid-season and I really don't want to watch anymore, but I still have a little bit of hope that it will get better. There are so many things wrong with this show.1. The Americans in the show are all completely and utterly stupid. I always suspected the FBI and CIA were not very good at dealing with people from other countries. It's our culture's lack of foreign language ability, arrogance, and ignorance of other cultures. But I just can't believe that everyone in the FBI is this stupid and incompetent and naive. It's really hard to watch stupidity.2. The Russians are all extremely intelligent. Their martial arts and fighting skills are above everyone's elses. They never make a mistake and they are always ahead of the game. It's frustrating to watch one side be so dominant (and it's the side I don't like) and the other side be so stupid. They win every fight they are in. They outsmart everyone around them. Blah. Boring.3. The story and the characters are implausible. I am a foreign language teacher, and no one can learn English that well after 12 years old, and I am pretty sure these Russians were not speaking English when they were in elementary school. The two main characters speak perfect accentless English like someone who was born in the US to two native born parents. Their actions and behaviors are 100% American. They don't even look slavic. It's just not realistic. They fit in too well. Also, don't their children wonder where their parents go at night??????I just can't recommend this show."
The main characters are too new or too blase' because I found it boring.  They have no believable drama when it calls for it and look like actors on a stick.  Sorry but I fail to see why it was renewed.
"The summary write up was intriguing. The open action sequence was excellent. The fight choreography great. Listening to Fleetwood Mac in the background added a good pulse-generating touch. So tell me, Mr. Writer and Mr. Producer, is it really necessary to throw in oral sex within the first fifteen minutes (with another round for good measure minutes later)? Just what did that add to the plot? Is this the ""art imitating life"" that we hear, over and over? I don't consider myself Mr. Moralist but I know that where there's smoke, there's fire. As I am told repeatedly, if I don't like it, I don't have to watch it. So, I'm not watching it. You took a perfectly good story, with good acting, and urinated on it."
The story was interesting but there were a lot of scenes I did not consider even with the rating (I figured it was on family tv)
"The core device of horror in Would You Rather isn't terrible: desperate people are competing, and getting paid to do horrible things to one another.  Many horror movies these days have populist and/or &#34;game show&#34; angle.  Recently 13 Sins and Cheap Thrills played with this concept in a pretty satisfying way.Would You Rather unfortunately distinguishes itself from those movies by not making much sense.  The title suggests something like Fear Factor, where participants torture themselves.  But what they actually do is choose which other participant they will do something awful too.  That said, there is no consequence for choosing wrong, or a real way to lose---except not participating.Players die incidentally because they are tasked with stabbing, hurting, and mutilating each other---not because of some wicked twist in the game or whatever.  The ending is also plain old stupid, and there are continuity errors in the film.  And perhaps the biggest issue of all: the gore is very weak."
"Intended as a brutal, cruel installment to the torture porn subgenre, it felt like the intensity was declawed, domesticated and rendered family-friendly.  However, at times the character dynamic in this ridiculous scenario makes the movie at least watchable, although still falling short of recommendable.Iris (Brittany Snow) is a good person with a good heart who finds herself in a difficult situation.  Her parents are dead, she has no money and no job, and she is left to care for her terminally ill brother.  Philanthropist Shepard Lambrick (Jeffrey Combs) offers Iris an opportunity to change her life in the form of an invitation to a dinner party that offers a solution to all of her foreseeable problems, financial or otherwise.  Upon arrival, Iris finds herself among similarly desperate individuals all looking to make some money.  Basically, this is Dinner for Schmucks if the schmucks were financially desperate and the hosts wanted to morally bankrupt them one sadistic challenge at a time.The guests include a mix of transients, gamblers, young and old, able and wheelchair-bound, friendly and unfriendly.  Completely out of left field, one of them is played by porn star Sasha Grey.  But the real wild card in this rated-R truth or dare is going to be the sweet, naive old lady in the wheelchair.  What is she going to do to people?  What are people going to do to her?It starts out with mean-spirited intentions--masked as helping people--in the form of paying a vegetarian to eat steak and fois gras and coercing an alcoholic to binge drink fine scotch. But they quickly graduate to things like ""would you rather electrocute yourself or Iris?""  Then lashings, stabbings, drowning and some other seemingly mundane, poorly executed,  unshocking punishments.  Even things that should have been hard to watch (in the hands of a different director) were presented in subdued, PG-13 form. Really, I could watch this with my grandmother.  She's seen Goodfellas and The Godfather, both of which have more scares, shocks and brutality than this.Iris is clearly meant to serve as the audience's moral compass.  But I never found myself rooting for her, nor caring about her or any of the other characters...except for maybe the transient, selfish Amy (Sasha Grey), the first one who realized how to get out of this alive.  In fact, from the start Amy really embraced the concept and celebrated the challenges as a malevolent force.Fledgling director David Guy Levy likely intended this to be a brutal, cruel installment to the torture porn subgenre.  However, I felt that the intensity was declawed.  I felt no suspense.  But I did enjoy watching the character dynamic as people tried to rationalize their ""would you rather"" options.  A task that, again, Amy really owned.  So while I was disappointed by the near gorelessness, watching the ""game"" still offered sufficient entertainment.A major shock was that the best performance wasn't by horror king Jeffrey Combs or Pitch Perfect (2012) favorite Brittany Snow.  The only convincing character was Sasha Grey's coarse portrayal of Amy.  But there were no shocks from schlock, gore, moral corruption, torture, cruelty or even the lame attempt a surprise twist ending.  Oh, and the old, sweet nave lady in the wheelchair?  Totally under-, or even un-utilized; mishandled by too much restraint while directing a film in which there should be no restraint!  What a waste.If you are looking for jaw-drops, you won't find them in Would You Rather.  I would only recommend this to someone who watches no fewer than four horror movies per week.  Really.  Like four.  As in, you probably systematically try to watch all horror ever anyway and won't listen to me as I try to warn you away."
"There will be some people who instantly dismiss the low budget shocker ""Would You Rather"" based on its rather unpleasant conceit. Indeed, the movie was brutalized by most mainstream critics upon its release. It currently averages a dismal 20 out of 100 possible points on the review aggregate site Metacritic. Despite this fact, I was never deterred by its ghoulish premise. I embraced it and it was a major selling point! I'm not squeamish, I welcome an experience that will shock and disturb me. Truthfully, I didn't hate ""Would You Rather."" I did, however, feel that it fell far short of its potential. At 2 1/2 stars, I'm giving credit to one of the B-movie greats. Jeffrey Combs (always the Re-Animator in my heart) gives an unexpected and offbeat performance as a bored millionaire that uses real people in his sadistic entertainment. He made me laugh on occasion and his interactions with his staff and his son are quite funny (although to be fair, maybe some of these sequences are unintentionally amusing). The overall experience was so dire and monotonously downbeat, I welcomed each instance of levity. After all, aren't games supposed to be fun?Combs, as I mentioned, plays an unorthodox philanthropist who hosts exotic dinner parties. He scours the city for likely invitees and brings them together for one unforgettable night. Brittany Snow plays an enterprising, but struggling, young lady who has moved home to care for her terminally ill brother. Treatment is expensive and hope is thin. When Combs proposes a chance for her to win financial independence and stellar medical care, it is an offer she can't refuse. Upon arriving at his estate, she meets other equally needy attendees. As the evening progresses, Combs seems intent on pushing everyone to their limits. How much would it take for a diehard vegan to eat meat? A recovering alcoholic to get blotto? This is simply a teaser, though. When the game of Would You Rather begins, contestants are pitted against each other in a series of events that escalate in gruesomeness. Who will be the eventual winner and what will winning cost?Absolutely terrific idea, right? For the movie to truly succeed for me, though, I needed one of two things. Either I really had to care about the characters or the competition had to be far more imaginative and fun. Snow is fine, if a bit drab. While she is supposed to be our moral center, I found myself rooting for Sasha Grey (as no-nonsense Amy) instead. Combs is a joy to watch, but the game lacked something overall. I won't spoil the individual surprises, but the realm of torture porn cinema has really raised the stakes in films of this kind. This is brutal and unpleasant, but surprisingly toothless as well. Touted, I suppose, as psychological horror--there isn't undue gore. But again, the characters didn't give me a lot to care about. Add the unnecessary and poorly developed subplot about the doctor, the intriguing father/son dynamic that is forgotten when necessary, and an ending telegraphed a mile away and I wanted to like ""Would You Rather"" much more than I did. I guess I'm officially jaded. This didn't really shock me, but its relentlessness did depress me. KGHarris, 7/13."
"Talk about a drab, colorless, senseless film.I adore horror thriller based films but this clunker falls short of most any genre you can think of. It's washed out cinematography is only surpassed by even more washed out performances - it's as if they borrowed the premise of the Saw franchise minus the gore and genuine tension of the first and then proceeded to steal, at least to some degree the story line of ""The Game"" - and pulled the eyeball slicing right out of the classic horror/thriller ""Repulsion"".There is nothing here you won't see coming and nothing you haven't seen before."
"Basically you have a lot of wasted time each episode.  The hosting is boring, the guests are dull, the laughter is sometimes obviously fake.The videos are funny, though.  They get less entertaining because of the lead ins, but they are the ONLY reason to watch this show.It would be better for you to spend your time searching Youtube.  That is basically what this show is--a Youtube search--with a ton of inane and unfunny discussion added to it."
"Disappointing English language remake of the classic 1976 Spanish horror flick Who Can Kill A Child? about a young couple on vacation who land on an island that seems to be completely deserted except for some children.  Stephen King co-opted the basic premise for his famous 1977 short story Children of the Corn so what seemed pretty novel and shocking in 1976 is much less so now.  This version follows the old Spanish flick very, very closely but where the original was extremely creepy this version is hamstrung by lousy acting (from the adult leads and the children alike) and never manages to generate any suspense whatsoever.  In this film the first victim the protagonist sees killed by the children is stabbed and bludgeoned with rocks.  In the original film the first victim was hung up like a human pinata while a smiling little girl slashes at him with a scythe.  Which sounds creepier to you?  Like the 2004 version of The Manchurian Candidate this ultimately comes across as much more timid and less imaginative than the original movie it's a remake of."
"Come Out and Play (Makinov, 2012)I first heard about the Spanish exploitation/horror flick Who Can Kill a Child? When Eli Roth touted it in a Five Films segment on the late (and much-lamented, at least at Goat Central) Rotten Tomatoes Show. At the time&#8212;this was probably five years ago now as I write this in November 2013&#8212;it was pretty much impossible to find in the United States Fast-forward to 2013 and I still haven't managed to catch the original. Unfortunately, I was unaware that Come Out and Play, directed by one Makinov (rumor has it this is Mexican director Gerardo Naranjo under a pseudonym, but I have not seen firm confirmation of that yet), was a shot-by-shot remake of Who Can Kill a Child? until I was about ten minutes into it. By that time I figured I would give it a shot, no pun intended. While I watched, I half-perused the vitriol unleashed at the movie on the IMDB message boards. I didn't hate it nearly as much as a lot of people did, it would seem. But then, I repeat, I haven't seen the original. For all I know they are completely justified, and let's face it, how often are shot-by-shot remakes successful? (Let's put aside the woeful remakes that would have been infinitely better had their directors opted for that approach.)Plot: the members of The Offspring... no, I kid (though I have had that song going through my head for hours now). A young married couple, Francis (The Lake House's Ebon Miss-Bachrach) and Beth (Vinessa Shaw from the The Hills Have Eyes remake), are taking one last vacation before they become parents, looking to get away from it all on a secluded island. When they get there, they notice a few kids fishing on the pier, but don't see any adults. They think nothing of it and head for their hotel, which is, again, oddly deserted. Eventually they realize there's a pattern here.My favorite thing about the movie, by far, was Makinov's attempts to get that seventies vibe going. There's a scene where a character is trapped in a radio hut with frosted windows, and you see hands banging the windows over and over again. That's nice stuff, right there, and for the most part there was no attempt to go young-and-beautiful with this cast (that would have actually not made a great deal of sense&#8212;after all, if your &#8220;adults&#8221; are only a few years older than your kids...). That, too, contributes to the seventies atmosphere. On the other hand, and this may seem contradictory, one of the few reasons one would consider watching a remake instead of just going back and watching the original is seeing how a director will take advantage of the updated technology available thirty-five years later to come up with gorier special effects. And yes, I'm the first to admit I'd probably be yelling at him for destroying the atmosphere if he actually had, but I end up asking the usual question: why did this movie need to get made in the first place?It's rather pretty, save some ridiculous, overdone scenes (wait till you see the hilarious opening shot of the end credits), and the acting is at least competent, but there's nothing here that would set this apart from about three hundred other horror films currently on Netflix Instant that either never made it to theaters in your area or never made it into theaters at all, and they all have the advantage of not being remakes. This is one of those &#8220;if you're drunk and have nothing better to do on a Friday night...&#8221; selections. **"
"This series is about what's wrong with America.  A Popeye's employee, who should have been fired on the spot, is given a ""mentor"", and put on the fast track to becoming a trainer.  It's probably all a big lie, but maybe it isn't.  Employees who work hard and do their job see other employees who are terrible get away with it, so why work hard at your job?  After watching a few episodes, I do think it's all fake.  There's a guy who walks an hour each way to work, so Popeye's gives him 10 grand to buy a car.  I'd have given him $20 to buy a used bike.  He can't figure out to car pool with someone, take the bus, or get a bike?  Give me a break.  I've worked lots of jobs.  I haven't seen lots of people who work real hard, but don't get recognized.  What I've seen is lots of people who do crappy work, steal from the company, and should be fired.  Yes, the show is fake."
"Anyone with an interest in the minds of sociopathic serial killers would of course be fascinated by Jeffrey Dahmer. And I would imagine captivated as I was by the in depth  Stone Phillips interview series with Dahmer, his father and his mother.Unfortunately, ""The Jeffery Dahmer Files"" tells us nothing new, poses no new questions nor does it leave you thinking much of anything aside from wishing you had you had that hour and twenty minutes back. Documentaries are a genre which I adore. Brilliant  film makers such as Enroll Morris know and understand that the subject weaves the story - there is no room what so ever for hokey ""re-enactments"" and staged self serving dialogue.Director Chris James Thompson never moves past a dull and hollow presentation, there's no insight into Dahmer just a huge dependence on over played news footage and again community theater level  ""re-enactments"" all this makes for is pretty awful story telling and worse movie making.Take a pass on this dreadfully dull failure and watch the Stone Phillips interview series on Dahmer I assure you it's riveting and I believe it's also available in it's entirety on youtube."
"This show had some potential, but it was cancelled by the network.  Not worth the time to watch just a couple of episodes."
"But poorly acted and directed.  Shame. The story line has a lot of potential but it seems the casting director missed the mark and mbecause it appears to be so poorly directed, the actors do not seem to have much to work wi\th."
Nothing else to say that aside of the plot is very unclear... and probably as amateur of SCIFI it's simply not my treat .
"I always thought Meagan was a bit arrogant, but since she was a neurosurgeon I was willing to give her a break because it comes with the territory.  However, this current season, she has gone well past the lines of ego right up to hubris.  She is no longer amusing to be around and if the behavior (read writing) doesn't change, I will be leaving this show, even if they did bring a hunk on board to play Tommy."
"As much as I love Mark Valley as an Actor (Human Target), and I think bringing him into the mix here was a good idea, how Delaney treats him and her own character has totally changed the show.  Her attitude is just disgusting now, and they lost me as a viewer after the third episode.  I dont see it as making it to season 4 without MAJOR changes in her attitude towards others."
"I could find nothing to commend this film.  Photography, script, screenplay and direction is poor.  What could have been a suspenseful story was a bore.  Marisa Tomei's performance was lackluster, principally because of a sparce script that left her little to work with.  She is described as starring in the film description, but her character has only a weak supporting role.  Other actors seemed to be reluctant to act.  Not even a ""B"" movie.  Most disappointing.  This film should not have been made."
"it seems they are more interested creating a serial like drama than any semblance of an accurate historical tale. another complaint would be that 50 percent of the time you are left looking at a black screen. i guess you save a lot of money on setting, make-up, costumes and so on, but really is not amusing to watch."
"I can tolerate a certain amount of graphic violence & understand that Viking life wasn't all sitting around looking for 4-leaf clovers - but this was WAY, WAY TOO MUCH!"
"Our 'hero' isn't particularly heroic.  The British are portrayed at insufferable just for defending their homeland. The idea of a shield maiden isn't developed enough to mean anything.  A main character is both a boatwright and a seer without explanation.  Our hero is about to dump his wife for lack of a long string of male heirs.  I don't expect anyone to clean up history, such as it is, but some illumination might work.  Given this is a history channel exclusive, we could have woven in some explanation of the levels of technology we are witnessing."
"It still amazes me how little people prepare themselves for making what is probably the biggest investment in their lifetime. They worry about little things like the color of paint, or cleaning the carpet. One couple liked the look of ivy climbing up a cinder block wall which faced their back yard. It didn't bother them that the wall was part of the industrial building next door. They didn't stop to realize that the price of the house, which was lower than typical for that street, had a reason. The higher priced houses were farther down the street from the factory, Other people liked the furnishings, or other items in a house, which normally do not go with the sale of the house unless those items are in a separate personal property sale agreement. Finally, I don't know many people who purchase a house after looking at only three houses.  This program has too much repeating of names, locations, and other facts, and in general is a poorly made time filler.  When I was a sales person, if I made as many errors in a sales presentation as most of the agents in this program do I would have starved and quickly gone out of business.  Buyers don't care what a sales person likes as the term, &#34;I like...&#34; is used over and over again during the sales presentations. The buyers were also about as competent as the sales person as they lacked basic knowledge and common sense."
"My wife and I got some great ideas for decorations and we like the &#34;contest&#34; aspect of the show, but ultimately the prissy attitudes of the judges (especially the French guy...go figure) are tough to swallow (pun intended).  I will give the show 2 stars only because of entertainment value and nothing more. You can find better ways to spend your time and energy than with this show.  I'm sad that I will not be able to regain the lost hours of our lives having been spent on this.  :-("
"6 Souls used to be called Shelter but after hemorrhaging cash at the global box office the producers changed the name and foisted it off on the streaming crowd to see if we'd give it a second chance. Fortunately, I watched it on Netflix for free but there's little redeeming about this poorly paced, confusing mess of a plot.Julianne Moore and Jonathan Rhys Meyers are both excellent and struggle to keep the fun going as the screenplay slowly gives up the ghost and unfortunately for these guys they're in practically every single scene. The psychological claptrap quickly disappates to JRM showing us how many American accents he can do as he gets possessed evermore frequently, and somehow the ""scientists"" involved don't decide to call it quits and go home before something really bad happens.Something really bad does happen, of course, involving a random dartboard collection of a preacher, a crazy-blind-old-woman-witch-doctor, skin breakouts that need urgent medical attention and bucketloads of exposition to fill in all the gaps. In darting between deciding what sort of story this is going to be, the audience gets thoroughly confused and the film treads a line where it never manages to be scary, interesting or gripping. Despite good performances from the two main characters, they can't save this one - skip unless you're very, very bored."
This is a movie worth watching. I personally don't care for Juliann Moore's acting. Good for watching on a night when there isn't anything else on.
"Too much ... everything, my sense is that the writers were a bit immature for the subject matter that could have been brought into the plot but was delayed to bring out points for shock value as soon as possible."
"When I first became aware that ""Bates Motel"" was coming to A&E;, I was fascinated (as a huge fan of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"") to see what direction the show would take the Bates characters.  Unfortunately, there is too little of that juicy dramatic material in this show (at least so far) and far too much ""stand-alone"" stuff that just isn't interesting enough to hold my interest.For a basic plot summary, the show sees Norma Bates (Vera Farmiga) and her two sons Norman (Freddie Highmore) & Dylan (Max Theriot) trying to start a new life after the death of Mr. Bates by opening a motel in a small-town community.  What they don't know, however, is that the town has more mysterious within it than those already bubbling to the surface of the crazy Bates family itself!The trouble with this show is that it could almost be considered false advertising for fans like me (e.g. those watching for the nods to ""Psycho"" continuity).  The series is 75% focused on original dramatic plotlines with only 25% on the real ""meat"" of the mother-son relationship that really should fuel the story.  Basically, every episode would leave me mostly disappointed (and not raring to watch the next, by any means) but also with a nugget or two of really good canon material.On the one main positive note, the acting in this show is excellent.  Farmiga is chilling as Mrs. Bates, while one could easily see Highmore turning into a picture-perfect Anthony Perkins Norman.Of course, that is just one man's opinion.  I have a brother who also watches the show (he has never seen Psycho) and he loves the original plots.  So, perhaps it really in this case does depend on why exactly you are sitting down to watch the show in the first place.  If you just want another mini-series type drama, it might be okay for you.  But if, like me, you have high expectations of the showing becoming true ""Psycho canon"" material, then you'll likely be disappointed (I actually consider the events of ""Psycho IV"" to be just as, if not more, interesting than this show so far in terms of explaining the backstory of Norman Bates).I'll probably be back for the Second Season of this show, but it will be grudgingly and with a short leash.  If it continues to only tease and tease with very little ""payout"", I don't think I could give it an entire season to play out again."
"This film got off to a great start. Great scenes; great cinematogrphy; grerat acting; great direction.The the two Brits show up and do NOTHING but pick fights, try to assert themselves very obnoxiously, and be generally very irritating.  mean---it's just not believeable that you're going to be real argumentative with two Lugers pointed at your face. When guns were pointed at my face a couple of times, my basic thought was, &#34;I hope this b*stard doesn't get nervous and make a mistake!&#34; Ergo, you don;t want tpo be arguing and yelling at the guy with the gun in your face.Also, I couldn't understabnd a word the two Brits were saying. At least the Germans had subtitles. The Brit captain became so absurd in his demands and arrogance that I found myself rooting for the Germans.I turned this dog off. It's just made up, preachy, silly, absurd crap that I suppose will entertain the much-younger than I am. Seeit if you want."
"I bought it and after watching it I thought  will I ever watch it again?....no it was good to watch one time and that was it. so I sold it asap.  very sad movie and don't let the plane on the cover art fool you, i didn't  see them in the plane lol"
"Even though I know that military families move regularly and often, I still find the changes in cast a problem.  The dramatic spark at the beginning of the season is not well handled.  I wonder how long it will last now?"
"The quality definitely shows its age and there are no educational value from it other than your kids will learn to call a big lizard to help solve manmade problems.  Story lines are simple and may be boring to kids that like today's computer-animated shows.With that said, it's a safe way to introduce kids to Godzilla."
"The premise had some promise, but the computer couldn't decide if it should be a law abiding style or a lunatic.  The character development was lacking and all in all I would find more satisfaction by watching an infomercial."
"Mom's the bread winner, dad's the well meaning idiot, the kids are witty, and there's a superhero involved.  I can't take these formula CGI proposals anymore.  After a plethora of superhero flicks and CGI animation, with cross pollination of the same, I can't say that I found a whole lot of originality in the first twenty minutes of what I saw.It didn't hold my attention for all of the character reasons I mentioned in the first paragraph.  Maybe it's just me, but I'm really sick and tired of the man in the family always being the double digit IQ stay at home dad, and equally tired of the kids and mom knowing more than dad does.And does the world really need another superhero movie?  Well, one more couldn't hurt.  But domestic issues, to me, do not a movie make.I may try to give it another shot, but for now it's lost me.Rescreen; July 4th, 2013It's as bad as I thought it would be, and worse.  The ""villain"" isn't much of a villain, and the overall film is flat and lacks vision.  And the alleged superhero doesn't do much superhero work.  With a script put together by a committee and a market research team, thing is as sociopathic as they come.Having said all that, I'm sure it'll recoup its cost in the market, but returns will be modest at best at its current status.Avoid this thing or watch it with some comfort food, because you'll need it."
"This is a seriously awesome concept. More Americans need to be aware of what life is like in Burma. Unfortunately, since extremely significant reforms have occurred in Burma, this film would no longer be nearly as powerful as it would have been 2-3 years ago. Aung San Suu Kyi's party has members who have been elected to parliament. She is no longer under house arrest.The film also suffers from extremely generic, stereotypical characters. I could have overlooked this and enjoyed the movie, if the message had still been wholly relevant. However, it isn't.I suppose that this movie could be reworked to take place in Tibet, or North Korea, or Chechnya... or Syria? But, I doubt it. No jungles. Different opposition organizations. Unfortunately, this film probably just needs to be indefinitely shelved. It's too bad. It had potential."
"Repetitive images and interview clips tire me out. Sure I believe something happened to this guy, obviously he's traumatized. But the film is thin, and filled with too much of the same over and over again. Better to watch any other paranormal show than this."
"Let's face it; when a person dies, most likely he just vanishes into the ether.  And no matter what people think, that same person probably did not exist before birth either.  (I'll accept life at conception as well.)  But good luck trying to prove life after death, heaven or hell, etc. etc.  Any of these positions is unprovable so arguing is just a waste of time.I did think about the film ""The Exorcist"" while watching ""My Amityville Horror.""  If you've ever watched that much-earlier-and-much-better film on disk, William Friedkin gives a very nice introduction beforehand by saying something like, ""What you bring to the film you will get out of it.  If you believe in evil, it will affect you in a certain way.  If you don't, then your experience will be different.""  I'm paraphrasing a bit, but that was pretty much the gist of it.  But in retrospect, I do believe that Mr. Friedkin wasn't exactly correct; I believe that ""The Exorcist"" is a danged scary movie no matter what belief system you have.And this documentary tries to spook you a little bit as well, but I don't think that it actually works.  No, let's say that it fails miserably.  Just because someone such as Lorraine Warren makes some assertion doesn't mean that I will necessarily believe that assertion myself.  And let's face another fact; without going for some cheap ad hominems -- which I could easily do and have seen others try with this film -- I didn't find Daniel Lutz to be exactly the most credible witness ever.  It made me think of another documentary that I didn't much like, ""I Survived BTK.""  Both films should have been quite gripping, but in reality, I found both of them to be quite suspect, mostly because of issues with the main characters in both films.I have seen the original ""Amityville Horror"" quite a few times, and I still remember watching it the first time.  While I was much younger, it did scare the hell out of me, especially the scene in the basement where the dog gets dragged down to hell, assuming that hell exists.  It's too bad that this film didn't get my attention as much as that one, at least in other ways.  After thinking about it for one night, I'm changing my score from a 3 to a 2, and that's mostly because I turned it off with about 10 minutes to go.  It's just almost unwatchable."
"Nothing really happens, no new information.  Thought this could maybe be a little interesting but turned out to be essentially pointless.  Though it was humorous how they kept cutting to the guy playing his guitar, I laughed quite hard whenever they did that.  Boy is this guy a weirdo though.  I would definitely not recommend this to anyone."
"One of those things you watch on Netflix when there's nothing  else to wawth - I agree with the other reviewers that this should be seen as a character study of a disturbed individual. I don't believe he is lying - I believe that HE believes what he is saying - like one of the speakers (a psychologist?) states - chidrens' memories are filled in by what they see and here until they become reality to them. It is interesting that although Danny claims to have been in therapy - he still harbors such deep hatred toward George, as an adult he hasn't been able to move beyond it. As an agnostic, (who believes in the paranormal), they lost my interest when Lorraine Warren whipped out her 'pieces of the cross Jesus died on' - yawn.But all and all, enjoyable enough to finish. And laugh of the day - the reviewer that gave this one star because she bought this thinking it was THE Amityille Horror movie - people never cease to amaze me."
"This is not a horror movie but documentary. For some reason if I remember it correctly, this was previously categorized as a horror movie. But right now Amazon changed it. Not clear though since I watched this on my Roku.Pretty much an interview with one of the involved individual in the incident."
"Firstly, a big fan of the doctor, been with him since, well the beginning.Russel Davies, and ""his"" relaunch, loved that stuff (if you get the chance, read his book(s) on the matter, very interesting behind the scenes anecdotes)...I liked Eccleston (sp?), and it sounded like there was a lot of behind the scenes politics behind his leaving.  To this day, he's still not spoken openly on what drove him or forced him to leave.(Yes, Virginia, I'm getting to it, give me a bit more time).Tennant and Davies leaving at the same time....  Well, that smacks of more unpublished background anecdotes that I would love to hear about some time.Moffat's first run, okay, the man overused paradoxen... paradoxies?  anyway, those seasons in conjunction with Davies and immediately after jumped several sharks, but were still very good.Then there was an announcement that ""we're going to go simpler now, no extended episodes, plots, etc.""  lived through a lot of that.Then we get to the whole River Sung wedding and beyond....  Extremely unlikely, contrived, but enjoyable 4.5 rating.(Let's call it Season 7)For the most part, it was to my mind an overly maudlin, drawn out farewell to Rorey and Amy.I loved those characters, really really enjoyed them, but a whole half a season with cruise control on to bid them a farewell?And the way that they were eliminated?!?  Really, I could drive a Mac truck through the logic holes in that whole thing.Doctor can't bring them back?  So, what, he could still in his world go visit if nothing else.And River?  Doctor married, then *poof* gone.Budgetwise I can understand it, plotwise, not so much.  (that part, I'd give a 3.5 on the Lou scale)Brings us to this second part;Clara, decent actress, but the lines they feed this poor girl and the vapid plotting....Had been trying to get my son on the Doctor Who wagon, just... about... had... him... snagged.... until these episodes.....He rolled off the couch and made it out the door (need to check on that, it's been awhile)I thought well, it's Moffat, so maybe he's trying to lull the audience into a false sense of knowing what is going on by re-using old plot devices, but to new purpose.Mysterious girl companion that is ""impossible""Doctor having some idea of an overarching mystery in place that no one knows about.(ad naseum)Even if that is the case, the episode by episode suspense build up just isn't there.  At this point, I  could really care less.I think the thing of it was, Davies was a control freak, and as such if the plot jumped the rails, he took the time to rewrite it to meet the ""flavor and depth"" of what he thought the Doctor should be.Moffat, not so much.Still enjoy the Moffat penned episodes and hoping the Neil Gaiman one is going to be good, but quality control just isn't there (in my opinion).I think the recent reviews are looking at the series through rose (no pun) colored glasses and remembering better days.But just wondering (yes, I am a fan of conspiracy theories), if there's more to the story of what is going wrong with this series...Dunno, but when looking for that sort of thing outweighs actually watching the show.....Well, still subscribed to it at this point, but honestly thinking I'm wasting my time."
"I am looking forward to the opening season this weekend!  Matt Smith as the 11th regeneration of Doctor Who is not my favorite, simply because I cannot figure him out.  Is he a lover, is he just a dork, is he a fighter, is he brilliant or just lucky?  Totally confused and his bumbling is a little unnerving, but for some reason - it still works."
It really feels like Moffat is squeezing everything and the kitchen sink into this part of the season. I'm interested in Clara but don't really care about the mystery surrounding her. It feels like the showrunner has lost his passion for the series and it makes me wonder if the 50th anniversary is going to be what long time fans hope. Classic Who needs more than a mention and a shove under the rug like it's getting on the show this year.
"I've only enjoyed one episode so half for the second half of season 7. I still find Clara very charming and quite interesting, but sometimes she can be very much window dressing. Kind of just there to look at and admire how charming and pretty she is. I don't feel she's been given enough to do compared to Amy Pond. This is only the beginning of her journey and I look forward to following that journey. I would recommend that people give this half season a try because we all have different taste. I will continue to watch until the season finale, but after that I don't know if I can continue purchasing such low quality episodes."
"I will start by saying I am a big Doctor Who fan, and don't buy many TV episodes of other series, but I always buy these.  And when Russell Davies stopped being part of the creative team some time ago, there was a noticeable decline in the charm/whimsy of the episodes but I still enjoyed most of the Rory/Amy storyline.  But the Rings of Akhaten wasn't just boring (which it was), the director really turned Matt's characterization of Dr. Who into an angst-ridden simpleton for this episode.  Clara's character is still interesting and dynamic, but Dr. Who has been left two-dimensional and out of character in many ways.  The story was simple, predictable and there was no real sympathy for any character other than probably some for Clara--but even then, it is only her stage presence that holds any real emotion.I didn't care much for the previous Bells episode either, but I gave it latitude in developing a new story-arc without two well-loved characters (Rory and Amy that is).  The same way I let go of Rose Tyler and Donna Noble and all of the Doctor's previous companions, I figured it will take a couple of episodes to integrate Clara (though she was fabulous in her earlier appearances before this current second part of Season 7).  But that does not account for the poor writing/directing and over-acting (I blame this on the director and not Matt) that this episode is full of.  Huge disappointment.  I only hope that they find their legs in a couple more episodes or I might decide I'm no longer a fan and stop buying them.  Honestly, I wish they'd get Russell back because his storylines with Moffett were the best (except of course the Doctor's Wife by Gaimon which was one of the best EVER!), but I'd settle for the better episodes of last season than whatever drivel this episode was.If this is your fist view of a Dr. Who episode, DON'T DO IT!  Go back to Rose Tyler to discover this wonderful series and hopefully this episode (and the previous one) is just a fluke of bad craftsmanship.  I've never before given a Doctor Who episode less than four stars and all of the Rose Tyler and Martha Jones seasons (and most of the ones after it) five stars!"
"I wanted to like this show so much, but the recipes are so far off the mark of what I imagined would come from a Pioneer Woman's kitchen (vegetables, meat, unprocessed cooking tips) I simply could not. Even though the host was sweet and charming, her food was absolutely full of sugar and chemicals. There was a point during one episode when they were camping out when she was making banana boats (?) for her kids that I was stunned. I get that everyone needs a treat now and again, but her show is loaded with high calorie, high sugar, sweets. This show should be named The Sugar Woman."
"This show has always had a nice premise.But, the constant attempts to be witty, funny and dramatic regularly (constantly?) get in the way of good television and keep the show from being really interesting."
The shows is good for riches who are affordable to pay too much for rent or own... I think it is a waste money to pay too much for rent .. or purchase... It is not worth to watch anyway as it;s my opinion.
"Great CGI and a compelling idea, and a great disappointment.  They could have developed so many themes from this premise. but they chose to make it a tale of emotional relationships.  All of the cliches are there: the rebellious teenage daughter, the young lovers, the Hispanic man defending his family, the clever witch, the cardboard males and the powerful women who, between running all the world knock out grown men three times their weight. This soap opera cum CGI seems suitable for teenagers and women, if they are into examining their emotions; adults interested in exploring larger questions need to be warned: this is dumber than Castle. For myself, I'm on to other and better shows, say Crossbones."
"Had this show aired in the 60's or 70's it may have been a hit. But, today's standards ( unless yo have been in cryostasis for a long long time) is a flop."
"This series had promise, but the story is very weak. Feels like &#34;Terra Nova&#34; all over again. Okay, it is a little better than &#34;Terra Nova&#34;, but not much."
"I like a different kind of sci-fi as opposed to this. Defiance seems more to me like a western set with aliens in the nearly wild frontier of a terraformed Earth. Seven alien races all at once? That is a bit over the top. I like sci-fi programs that have a bit more imagination to them and that are adventures.I know plenty of people like this new series in that it is linked in with an interactive game, but for me, this one just does not fly. Finally, the same old theme with love triangles just bore me to death."
"It's been a while since I gave this a try, but...just no. SyFy keeps trying to turn out the next big sci-fi hit but keeps missing the mark."
"This show has a well worn plot.  The ousted good guy who is on his own and ends up trying to save the town, the county, the world because his good side wins out over the old selfish nature. The twist for this show? Instead of your normal ethnic races of earth they threw in some aliens for the big diversity card. Ho Hum."
"The CGI is good, artistic, believable. But the costuming and make-up are a throw-back to 60s Star Trek. And the storylines! We've been there before... kind of a mix between Mad Max and the worst storied part of Walking Dead (you know, when the heroes were battling the tyrant of a walled city. Glad that sequence is behind us ). But Walking Dead is a great show. This one falls flat. I watched fifteen minutes of the first episode and already knew what was going to happen next -- so I shut it off. Are there no good writers with original scripts out there?"
"Can't really say why this show did not appeal to us as we enjoy shows with an unusual twist.  This show centers aroun survivors on Earth after an apocolypse.  This show has a twist, in that there are aliens in the mix.  Just couldn't get into the plot of the show."
"I have given this show three chances to be something more than mundane, regurgitated science fiction tropes; unfortunately it still has yet to break-free and form its own identity.  The story is dull, the acting is sub-par, and the cgi is atrocious (even the biggest fans of the show have to admit this).  There are several other options in the Amazon instant video store that far surpass this one.  I cannot recommend this show."
ANOTHER after the world has gone to hell show.good acting tho and could be better but it's beendone a hundred times and I just got tired of themakeup and the script wore on me..which is a shameas the lead guy is a decent actor..but it just misses themark and is nothing to write home about..but that's just me.
"This show looked promising so I gave it a shot. It greatly disappointed me. With each episode watched I grew less and less interested; so much so that by the time the season finale came I didn't even care to watch it, not even to avoid having wasted my time watching the episodes that came before it. The show is quite simply a bust and not worth watching."
"I started watching for Mia Kirshner who does a lot with her medium to small part as a brothel/saloon keep.  The albino aliens are shockingly degenerate - the rest of the alien races are just wearers of recycled stock costumes from the wardrobe department.ETA:  rewatching this episode AFTER I learned of[[ASIN:B0007K2SRG Piepel]] which is probably the reason for Joss Whedon'sDollhouse: The Complete Seasons 1 & 2as well as learning of the companion book, I realize WHY Mia Kirshner is playing a willing prostitute (named Kenya Rosewater to hint at her heritage) and why in this episode, she says to a dirty blonde customer that (1) he doesn't have to pay because he is ""fun"", (2)the wife of the zombie-looking Castithian ""customer"" is hugged and THANKED for sharing her wonderful husband with the girls of NeedWant and that (3) Kenya Rosewater calls her fellow prostitutes ""Night Porters.""The racist, elitist Castithians claim to be seeking refuge on Earth from their inhabitable situation at home and to be against the Volge but really they are a menace intent on taking over and ruling over others.  Defiance is about the balancing and unspoken brinksmanship that goes on against these would-be comrades.This is from House of Dolls which is available to read on the web - Fella reminds me of Kenya Rosewater:""Fella never forgets for a moment that agreat miracle has befallen her here. The Camp Commander ispleased with her. Fella knows how to win the heart of the GermanBeast And when Yaga has had a few drinks, she pours her heartout to Fella as to a close friend. Fella has already heard fromYaga the most intimate stories of her life: about her beau, thecommander of nearby Camp Niederwalden, who is two-timingher; about her youth, which she spent in a whorehouse in Dres-den. In her drunkenness she often sympathizes with Fella forhaving been born a Jewess. If not, she wouldn't be a prisoner buttake it from Yaga commander of a German concentrationcamp. She'd have seen to that Fella is her only true-blue friendin the whole wide world. """
"The special effects are really poor, even for SciFi. This series is tied into a computer game, something that is going to be the next con job (like action figures became, where the made a series just to sell toys). Maybe the graphics are so bad because they wanted to match the 8 year old consoles graphics? I watched the pilot in 3 sittings because I got bored and started doing something else.They should have kept Alphas, or some other good series, instead of making this."
"I know its a show but the graphics are sub par and the story line is boring.  For some reason, I don't like the main male character in this show.  Sadly, I only watched one episode so I may be judging too early.  The game on the other hand is great!  First true MMORPG for a first person shooter.  I give it props!"
"I wanted to like this show, I just lost interest after three episodes, it just does not hold your attention, not mine anyway, I find the story to have been told before, not original, the effects are good, the actors are good, it's just the story."
"Okay...sometime within a span of 33 years. around the present time, planet Earth gets colonized by not just one, but seven (yes,7!!) different species of aliens in addition to the human population.  Then the Earth presumably experiences all kinds of catastrophic wars and gets completely ""re-terra-formed"", not just biologically but geologically too.  Major cities are also suddenly transformed into vast expanses of what resemble ""Wild West"" towns - except for the Saint Louis arch, which seems to have survived intact, albeit in some disarray. (Although the Mississippi River bed seems to have been long dried out and lined with tall, rocky cliffs.)  And to top it off, everyone of every species dresses in clothing appropriate to the 1700's-1800's while carrying laser and pulse weapons more powerful than anything seen before, even in the most outlandish sci-fi. And of course, all clothing ensembles are complete with the usual holsters and bandoliers of bullets across everyone's chest.  And everyone seems to drive off-road vehicles that look like something Detroit decided not to produce back in the 1950's.Finally, the graphics tend to like video games rather than high quality CG and green room work. I can't decide if this production is supposed to be animation, soap opera, or cinema.I like science fiction as much as the next guy, but this one is way too much and I don't even want to try to follow wherever it is going. Bad writing, bad acting, and bad cinemetography."
I rented this movie exam a fan of the leading man. I've always enjoyed his work. In this movie I didn't get involved and I don't think he got involved either. The movie was shot for lighting very little character development I did not seem to care about the story the characters or the cast.  I hope others find it more entertaining than I did!
After a time of see this serie i wonder what happens with the subtitles . Is no a bad serie of the universe but the millions of people who are deafmute will no apreciate.
Improve the show by-only picking peeps who will actually BUY a house-show home after buyers have improved it
"This show seems more realistic than most DIY shows.  However, it is pretty boring because the producers show the same scenes over and over because of the way the commercial breaks were cut out.  It also seemed pretty over dramatized.  I wouldn't recommend watching this one unless you're looking for something to help you fall asleep."
I would not recommend this show.  It's all about her and her problems.  I got weary of hearing about her problems while the renovation was being done.  I wanted to hear discussion of the project.
"This is the kind of movie that gives criticism a bad name. I appreciate its existence, but in no way could I recommend it. Of course we all see and derive different opinions from various forms of art, it's all subjective. But some forms of opinion that are displayed in this film are not only idiotic, but somewhat offensive(the holocaust...really?). There are things to read in the Shining for sure, but for the most part its just an effective ghost story with haunting visuals. Look if you believe 9/11 was a cover up for us to go into Iraq or that Neil Armstrong never landed on the moon but on a constructed Hollywood set then you're the type of audience for this film. Me I live on planet Earth."
"This presentation is in documentary form with odd people that spend time speculating on supposedly purposely hidden messages permeating Kubrick's film ""The Shining"" (1980) with some compare and contrast to the Stephen King novel.There is a montage of clips from:""Foust"", Friedrich-Wilhelm-Marnau, 1926Demons 2 (1986)Demons (1985)Video from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial MuseumMaking of the Shining (1980)Eyes Wide Shut (1999)Full Metal Jacket (1987)The Shining (1980)Barry Lyndon (1975)A Clockwork Orange (1971)2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)Dr. Strangelove (1964)Lolita (1962)Spartacus (1960)Paths of Glory (1957)The Killing (1956)Killer's Kiss (1953)Fear and Desire (1953)Dreamscape (1984)Brainwaves (1983)In the Land of War Canoes (1914)The Beast in Heat (1975)Jesus Christ Superstar (1973)The Magic Mountain (1982)Sitting Bull at Spirit Lake Massacre (1927)An American Werewolf in London (1981)Wolf (1994)The Three Little Pigs (1933)Creepshow (1982)Capricorn One (1977)The White Buffalo (1977)Satyricon (1969)The Brain from the Planet Arous (1957)Spellbound (1940)The Terror (1963)Apocalypto (2006)The Legend of Hell House (1973)Agency (1980)Kicker (1981)The Shining (1997)Summer of '42 (1971)Schindler's List (1993)Dr. Doolittle (1967)My Fair Lady (1964)The Battle of Apache Pass (1853)All the President's Men (1976)Drums Along the Mohawk (1939)Did aliens build the pyramids?Did Stanley Kubrick incorporate disenfranchised Indians?Did Columbus think that the Western Hemisphere was India?Did Stanley Kubrick incorporate dispatched Jews?Did we know that we are being watched by a cabal?Did Stanley Kubrick incorporate ideas from the book ""Subliminal Seduction?""Did the government use widgets in Telstar?Did Stanley Kubrick incorporate nasties into rug patterns?Are you going to waste one hour and 43 minutes and four seconds on this claptrap?"
"Someone said in the long time ago that people see what they expect to see. If &#8220;Room 237&#8221; proves something, it is exactly this famous saying. The film is a documentary about five avid fans of Stanley Kubrick&#8217;s classic &#8220;The Shining,&#8221; who present through voiceover their theories about the hidden meanings by analyzing the details.The idea is great. Execution is not. Each commentator&#8217;s analysis is introduced in a random way, and there is no sense of structure and narrative development in the whole film. The documentary goes on and on jumping from one theory to another without exploring any of these contents.I believe Stanley Kubrick paid attention to every single detail, down to the number of the room, even though I do think some part of these details is accidental. Still, I admire the passion and enthusiasm of these five fans, and some of their analysis are really interesting (about a wrecked red Volkswagen beetle, for instance), but most of them are just far-fetched and uninteresting. Fakes moon landing? Oh, please.There is one good thing about the documentary, and that is it has a lot of footage from the original film. After all the merit of watching &#8220;Room 237&#8221; is that it reminds us of how great &#8220;The Shining&#8221; is."
Although James Mcavoy is an awesome actor I found this movie pretty boring. the story dragged the plot kind of stunk. the movie did not get exciting until the last ten minutes of the movie then it just stopped with James's character putting his hands behind his head. I won't go into anymore detail so I won't ruin the movie for who wants to watch it. but all I can say is that I found it dull. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you don't
These &#34;Housewives&#34; series used to be somewhat entertaining but the &#34;players&#34; are just so self-involved the show has become painful to watch.
If you want something fun and educational for the kids. I strongly recommend curious George instead which is free on prime.Another fun series is avatar airbender.This one is boring and poorly put together in comparison. Even my dinosaur crazy kid doesn't really get into it.
"Here&#8217;s the thing about comedy: if you beg, borrow, or steal it, it usually isn&#8217;t as funny the second time around.  No matter how hard you try.  No matter how everyone involved tries.  It just won&#8217;t work the same way.  Ever have to explain a joke?  Ever notice how &#8211; in the process &#8211; everything remotely humorous about it gets sucked away with each passing word?  Same thing.  When you pilfer from the best, you&#8217;re at least playing solid odds that whatever audience shows up will give you only gracious laughs but not necessarily ones all that legitimately earned.Humor works best when it comes from an original inspiration.  When all you do is take bits and pieces from what others have done before you (especially when it comes to comedy), then you should be fully prepared to be called a &#8216;hack.&#8217;  You deserve it, after all, and so does everyone who shows up to help you out.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)From the product packaging: &#8220;A Russian space station crashes in Amsterdam, releasing a deadly virus that turns everyday citizens into flesh-craving psychopaths.  Aziz (Yahya Gaier), his brother Mo (Ouled Radi) and several strangers emerge from jail, oblivious to the mayhem until they team up with a local police officer (Gigi Ravelli).  After receiving a desperate call for help, this unlikely band of heroes sets out on an insane rescue mission &#8211; and it&#8217;s going to take a seriously crazy plan if they want to get out alive &#8230;&#8221;I&#8217;m a stickler for comedy, and, if you learned anything from what I wrote above, you know that I think it works best when it&#8217;s fresh, original, and timely.  That&#8217;s a mighty big success to achieve, and directors Martijn Smits and Erwin van den Eshof give it an affable try in a script that barely hints at anything original in it.  Sadly, we&#8217;ve seen these characters before (in much better films); and we&#8217;ve seen this set-up and situation all too often (again, in far superior outings).  If this represents the best they have in their arsenal of entertainment, then the Dutch might wanna leave zombie comedies to the rest of the world.Naturally, there are a few tweaks here that work quite well, so KILL isn&#8217;t a complete failure.  Amsterdam has never looked better!  A Cold War era Russky soldier gets some of the best one-liners in his five minutes of film!  Aziz&#8217;s &#8216;Holy Grail&#8217; turns out to be the official &#8216;Office Skank.&#8217;  At times, KILL musters a recognizable charm (that we&#8217;ve seen stronger elsewhere).  The problem is that it never mixes up its ingredients enough to force this mixture to congeal into the confection everyone involved probably thought it was going to be.For example, leading man Yahya Gaier seems all wrong here, so much so that he looks like he isn&#8217;t having all that much fun.  Likewise, his big screen brother (Radi) grins and goofs through his dialogue, though he never quite seems to tap into proper comic timing to make the best of the dire circumstances.  Dare I say, the only one who seems at home here is the fetching Ravelli &#8211; she dominates every scene she&#8217;s in the way a leading lady should &#8211; an actress who clearly understands what the script and directors wanted out of her and delivers in a big way.Too bad they couldn&#8217;t have used a few bucks from whatever budget they had to hire a decent continuity person, as the forever-changing blood stain patterns on Gigi&#8217;s clean white blouse gets downright irritating in the second half.Or was that a joke, too?KILL ZOMBIE! (2012) is produced by Launch Works and Talent United Film & TV.  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled by the stellar Well Go USA Entertainment.  For those folks needing it spelled out perfectly, this is a Dutch spoken language release with English subtitles available.  As for the technical specifications, this is a very well-made release, and it dishes out some high quality sights and sounds (though a few effects sequences are pretty bad).  Lastly, if it&#8217;s special features you want, then you&#8217;ll be sorely disappointed: there&#8217;s only a theatrical trailer to make your day.(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED.  As charming as KILL ZOMBIE! is, it&#8217;s also quite obnoxious.  Unfortunately, the script by Tijs van Marle borrows only the best ideas of vastly superior films but never quite puts them to good use.  As a result, the story never metastasizes into anything so noble as those films it derives its narrative and situations from, practically sucking the life out of screwball moments that go on for too long.  Still, fanboys are likely to swoon over the unintentionally luscious Gigi Ravelli, the single-best Dutch treat ever to put on the police uniform.  Be warned: she&#8217;ll have you wishing for the Apocalypse in no time at all.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Well Go USA Entertainment provided me with an advance DVD copy of KILL ZOMBIE! by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it."
I hoped this would be interesting but it was simply too low-budget for the idea of pre-WWII spies in Warsaw.
"I really wanted to like this, but the story development seemed dis-jointed and dull. The lead actor would have been excellent as a British spy, but he was playing a Frenchman and did not seem French. This made the whole thing unrealistic."
"David Tennant seems to be sleepwalking through the role, and while it's one thing to be gallant and devil may care it's another to be completely devoid of any emotion and convey absolutely no sense that one's life may be in danger. Alan Furst, the author, writes meticulously researched and detailed novels, focusing on Europe during WWII, and has a wide fan base. Personally I find his books overly detailed, his writing wooden and the immense array of poorly developed characters that come and go non-compelling. Overall I found this production lifeless, but if you like the books, give this series a go--perhaps you will enjoy it."
"I like psychological thrillers and from time to time it intrigues me, but it gets very macabre and over the top gross."
"This film offers some valuable lessons about autism but it's execution is uneven. The character he worked with (the owner's son) was simply not believable. Luke's character was much more engaging and believable. The early parts of the film are slow to develop. In my view, the story probably could have been told in less time but it's worth seeing."
I have watched and loved DC from the beginning but just as some of the fisherman I have grown pretty tired of it and am retiring from watching it Since the Cornelia Marie is gone things seemed to have gone downhill from there with the story lines.  I have watched faithfully until the last 2 years though.  Sad about it!
"I found this to be a bit slow and nothing special, but if you are looking for something that's none offensive for a family to watch together, this my suite you."
The dog puppet is not as cute as the other Jim Henson's puppets and the story was not original or captivating.  My 4 yr old loves the Pajanimals but lost interest less than 5 minutes into the pilot episode.  The graphic of the hand drawings is not great either and that could be another reason why she lost interest so quickly.  Would be better had at least half of the pilot is done with the puppet/animation (this comment also applies to all the children animation pilots).  Need some work on several aspects for this show to work for us.
"This pilot revolves around Dorothy going to Oz in order to snag a birthday present for her Mom, but the inherent problem was how her mother knew about Oz immediately without question or concern. Along with how each of the character were already familiar with Dorothy. Setting the story in Kansas with tornadoes with Dorothy ''landing'' in Oz mysteriously would've been better. Putting more of the Oz mythos would've helped a great deal here. As does adding mystery, conflict, or a moral lesson. Also, the switch from traditional hand drawn animation to stop motion/claymation, and finally to preliminary sketches was more than a tad jarring.That being said...I do think subverting the ruby slippers in favor of the golden magical hat was a nice change.Hope to see some improvement as this moves forward."
"Interesting concept - based on Wizard of Oz characters but don't see anything interesting beyond that.  Also should have at least 1/2 of the pilot done in animation (gorgeous, by the way).  It is really difficult to use imagination to continue watching the show when the story was just ok and with parts in black and white sketches...."
"The show is to slow for my 4 year old son. The art is choppy and lacks emotions on characters. The educational value is low, which shows that the show is neither fun nor educational. So far the only original Amazon show that I see has potential is the Annebots."
"Had to take some convincing to get my five year old to watch this - her brother pressured her into doing so.  Something about the alien is a little blah, generic.  Once they were watching, they were interested in the art, especially the explanation of pointillism, but they both lost interest in the entire show about halfway through."
"I watch a lot of these paranormal shows.  Some I really enjoy.  Other shows can be interesting or have something to offer. Some, I just can't handle.  Like Ghost Adventures, it has some great evidence but the dude annoys me so much I can't watch.  This one, well I actually like these good ol' boys.  But to be honest, in the two episodes I watched, I didn't see anything that impressed me as far as their techniques or evidence.  Lights popping on on a rim pod a couple of times brings hoots and hollers and bell ringing from the old dude.  A dead bird is counted as evidence when there are cats on the farm...just seems like a lot of nonsense.  I have family in the south and this feels like not much more than their superstitions.  Do they collect real evidence?  In the two shows I've seen it has been a lot of muddin' and playin' but not a lot to impress.I like these guys.  I wish they would do less playing and more real ghost hunting.  Their personalities would come through without ten minutes of 4-wheelin footage."
"Not a bad joke or anything, but they make fun of a show you may want to creep you out. Random characters, names, and personalities."
"Not as good as some of the other ones like paranormal witness and Stranded. What evidence they do get it seems they hardly show. It's kind of laughable how they want the spirits to react to them and then freak out when they do. Not as good as the previously mentioned two, but will watch because it's about the only paranormal show going on right now."
"While the animation and voice acting is fairly, there needs to be a small bit more development in the plot and character. It's great the main character tries to learn and figure out how to do things, but there needs to be more ''meat'' behind it."
"This is a show that would be good to watch at the wee hours of the morning after returning from the bar. Course, turning on my Amazon is not the first thought that I have at that time, so I'd probably never watch this show.The Indiana Jones reference was fun, but after they go to the mall it was just banter. Since that is the main setting for the show, most of it will become just banter quickly."
It just isn't a show for me. I could barely finish it. This may be a show that others enjoy.
"Oh, good religious icon! This was hella bad! I will say that the animation was good, writing was pretty crisp, and voice acting was acceptable. However, just the premise alone was enough to make me want to click ""x"" on my screen. Basing an entire pilot around the crystal skull from ""Indiana Jones 4"" Is that the best they could do? Say what you want about the sometimes-amusing racist depiction of just about everyone involved, that was hardly the worst offense here. I really wanted to see amazon.com succeed in their first animated show, but this was something even the worst show on Comedy Central couldn't compare to. It reminded me of an old MAD TV sketch with Nicole Sullivan doing her thing, and I didn't care for that show either. I guess you could compare it to The Boondocks with lady characters, but they could have made them at least somewhat appealing. The pop culture references made me think of the now-canceled ""Ugly Americans,"" which worked on about five levels above this. I got the feeling even Adult Swim wouldn't wash their hands with this pilot. Out of all the amazon.com pilots I have seen, this is the only one I wouldn't even consider watching if it somehow got a series order. Maybe other people would watch it b/c they know ""so many people just like"" the two leads, but that does not mean I would watch a show about them. Consider this a vote of UN-confidence."
The two leads are a bit obnoxious. The pilot overall wasn't that interesting and I do not believe I would watch this series.
"I think I laughed once during the episode, but it wasn't a ""laugh out loud"" laugh. This show sounded funny. It really sounded like something I would like... but I just don't care. Can't quite put my finger on why. I wasn't offended by anything. Would've been more appealing if it was hand drawn. The computer generated animation felt really generic. The voice acting was sub-par too. I would give it another chance, but the next episode would probably follow the same patterns. Too bad."
"The premise of this show, in which two seemingly everday females tackle supernatural evil, is an intriguing one.  However, it's obvious the show is written by men, and so I think that will lose much of any female audience it could have otherwise snags - a market that is poorly unaddressed in the world of animation.  I'll give it a couple more episodes, to see if they work out the kinks, but at this point - it might as well be two male heroes yet again."
"If you like adult swim you'll like this, it's not for me and I didn't find it funny, but I'm sure many people will."
became quickly bored with the episode and did not even finish watching.  disposable characters which did not generate any feeling of attachment
"Not good.  From the hood accent females to the blatant political incorrectness (which I wish was funny, but missed the mark) to the odd storyline (mall workers moonlighting as international artifact hunters?) to the contrite villains, this was not good.  Nice try, but try again.  REDLIGHT"
"Not particularly good. Looks like flash animation and not that good. The dialog is bad. It sounds like the two women doing the voice acting just read the script while it was recorded. I think it is supposed to be about two sassy street smart girls, but it comes across as one wannabe and one not so smart. Overall, just bad."
"I don't think I'm the right audience for this. I laughed a couple times, but maybe there's something I'm missing. I dunno. I just don't feel right about reviewing it. If you like Adult Swim, or Ugly Americans, watch this show. You'll probably enjoy it. As for it's odds of getting picked up? Not a chance in hell."
"I really wanted to like this one, but it didn't work for me.  The voice talent was great - it's the writing and jokes that let them down. Too many stereotypes, old cliches, the central premise seemed totally recycled (one capable character paired with one not capable character), fast and furious ""jokes"" that came across as trying to hit the target instead of actually funny and, frankly, everything seemed to have been warped in from the late 90's.  Also, that was the longest 20-odd minutes.  In spite of all the fast-talk, the episode dragged."
"Price, I'm a big fan of your reviews on TV.com so it pains me to say this, but I didn't find this funny. The tropes are tired and played out, and frankly it's lazy writing. The pilot set up a story line for the season, but just barely. I will not be sticking around for future episodes if it gets picked up. This reminded me of Ugly Americans and the same kind of lazy plot lines."
This was not very entertaining. I was done before the show was. Anybody giving this more than 3 stars must be stoned.
"During the opening, after I found the disclaimer 'warning: actors will break out in song' somewhat amusing, my initial reaction was-- I hope these intro numbers are just that, and will never be shown again.  Unfortunately, the characters break into forgettable pop sounding tunes that are a bubble left of plumb.When I watch a comedy that doesn't quite work, I often feel as though I can see the thinking, see it on the page, and it was probably a good idea at the time.  The execution doesn't work.  On a show or skit that IS working, a viewer can forget that this was on someone else's page, as the actor makes it his own.Like watching SNL, when some skits take off and others just lie there, good ideas gone wrong.The set up is fine.  Unpaid internships.  Varied foursome plopped into a HuffPo environment, headed by a Bebe Neuworth (Huffington) who hasn't found her character.  Horse's behind intern from the previous bunch lording it over everyone.  He's pretty good.  The 28 year old employee who disses the lanky geek was nicely underplayed.I couldn't finish watching it after the fourth number.  Oh, no........NOT another dumb song.Points for the setting, the difficulty of new grads trying to ooze into a biz they are already in debt for after 4 years of college, and not getting paid.  More realism can still be funny.  So far, this show is NOT."
I do like musicals but I wasn't real thrilled with this and watched 20 minutes before I moved on to something more interesting. I thought the introductory songs lingered on far too long (except for the coughing part--most humorous!). Probably should of watched the entire thing before I ranked this; it oould of been a decent show---maybe clip each solo so they are are not so lengthy...
"So this may not be a fair review, since I turned it off during the opening song, but I really don't want Amazon to waste their content space on what appeared to be a Glee rip off show. Please no musicals about whiny, entitled millenials."
"The characters are clich&eacute; the acting is sub par, the script needs work and do we really need another musical that no one will watch. Does anyone remember the cop musical, how about the musical that revolved around a small casino outside of Las Vegas. Even Smash, a very well done musical about musicals is being canceled. Only Glee has any staying power and that's because of its pre-pubescent fan base."
"I really wanted to like the characters, but just when I thought they were interesting, they broke out into song which did absolutely nothing for the plot or the character.  Sorry guys, this one wasn't for me."
"What were they going for?  High School Musical but with expletives?  Who wants to watch a comedy/drama with songs and dancing that are done by reality stars.  Not one of these actors is a Gene Kelly, John Travolta or Jennifer Lopez.  I just did not feel that the younger cast was up to the task of a musical, nor were the songs and choreography up to the standards of a 1st rate show.  If Amazon wants this to feel like a real High School Musical on a weekly basis they hit the mark.  But, I will not be watching.  I like musicals, when they are done professionally."
Probably too close to reality to be a sitcom.  And it really doesn't play well as satire even though one of the songs does riff off the old theme song from the Mary Tyler Moore show.  Really don't care for any of these characters.  Just superficial fluff without a solid center.
The music was fine. The plot seemed a bit forced to me though. I can't see this being successful. Not sure who the demographic would even be.
"This show is definitely not my thing. I don't mind musicals, in general (as an aside: the musical episode of Scrubs was probably my favorite of that entire show), but I couldn't stand this. The characters were too cheesy for my taste--they were all very generic caricatures that lacked depth. Trite is the word I'm looking for. Additionally, the songs felt forced and were always jarring. The songs in a good musical should come naturally. These really didn't, in my opinion. I also didn't find the singing to be very good.Honestly, I had a hard time getting through the episode. I made sure to finish it, but I found it unpleasant. I know some people enjoyed it, though, so I must just not be the demographic it's targeted at. For me it was grating. Your mileage may vary."
"The song had some semi funny lyrics, but I'm not really a huge fan of musical tv. Never watched Smash and couldn't get through an episode of Glee. During the song it looked like there was some bad lip syncing going on by the asian girl, and I could let that slide since it's not always easy to do. But after the singing was over it still looked like she was lip syncing, when nobody else did.The writing was alright, the cast was kind of annoying. If this were made into a show I wouldn't watch it."
"The acting itself is great, but my interest was honestly lost within the first 4 minutes of the show..might appeal to different audience, but remember what has happened with similar shows, i.e. Glee..started strong, but now fizzled. :-("
"The show is trying to be similar to a &#34;Glee,&#34; but no where close. The acting/singing is sub-par and the story line is dismal."
"The only thing that kept me from making this a one star was the fact that two of the actresses were well played and well cast.  That being Constance Wu and Bebe Neuwirth.  Other than those two, the cast was simply stupid.  Most of the songs were ridiculousness and the direction of the show was like a wet washcloth.If you don't like stupid comedy skip this one, or rather watch it and rate it so junk like this doesn't get made."
"This show is a disappointing production overall. Story, acting, singing, and direction all pretty bad.  How do you make Bebe Neuwirth look bad?  She is an amazing singer/actor and she couldn't shine in this terrible production."
"It was just kind of weird. The singing audio didn't quite match the video, so it didn't look like people were really singing. None of it was very funny."
This just didn't do it for me. I thought the jokes were lacking both lyrically and in dialogue. Actually I think in the first few seconds the lip syncing was just really not in sync at all which made suspension of disbelief almost impossible...
"I can see how some might like it, but it was not for me. All the (not great) singing really killed it for me, I didn't make it through the pilot. But I won't give it one star, because I think I'm just not the target audience for this show."
"I'll be the first person to say that I'm normally not big on musical numbers, so admittedly there is some bias in that department. But even for people who enjoy them, I just don't think they're done terribly well in 'Browsers.' Also, all of the characters fit very tired and cliche' archetypes (stoner, nerd, gay guy, iron lady, etc.). The concept of the show itself isn't that bad, and the way the characters interact is very reminiscent of 'Scrubs,' which was a very good show. Overall I don't like the show mainly because it's weakest point, the musical numbers, also happens to be the only real memorable thing about it. You would think just getting rid of the musical numbers would make the show better, but in actuality, it would just make the show completely forgettable."
"Terrible.Seems like it might have promise but then they bust out an ""impromptu"" song that is terrible.Also, if you're going to reference social media (@modernvaljean) it helps if someone has actually created some content for that account."
It was a self indulgent vapid display of every thing that's wrong with modern entertainment. It tried so hard to be clever and hip that it wound up being neither.It has potential I in that there was obviously talented players.
"A musical TV series?  OK, at least it's not &#34;World's Most Boring Job that We try to make Interesting by Featuring an Obnoxious Prick to Yell at the other People&#34;, or a forensic crime show, but still doesn't quite make it.Maybe I'm not the target audience, but I only made it to about 15 seconds into the 2nd song before I went into diabetic shock."
"Sorry guys, didnt like this one. I hated Lez Miserables because it sang EVERY word.  I felt a little dread during the opening scene of Browsers.  Not sure why there is this mash-up of SMASH & THE OFFICE. For me, it doesnt work.  What does work for me is Bebe Neuwirth. She was great!"
"The idea is cute. It's a sitcom, but it's a musical. It's got quirky personalities thrown together in a dysfunctional workplace. What could go wrong? Well, it's rude. To me, the F-word is for extreme situations and for ignoramouses who lack the vocabulary to express themselves any other way. These characters are smart and articulate, so why is their dialague riddled with F-bombs? Bebe Neuwirth is so watchable -- a consumate pro. I can't understand her agreeing to do this. She even gets the best musical number in the pilot -- except it's framed around the F-word. Show some creativity, people! Lose the language, and I might watch."
It had me for an Internet minute abd tehen I stumbled away.  I really like Constance Wu though - she was like 'Far out' . . more please.
"I think that this was the my least favorite of the pilots, I like the actor from Paranormal Activity 3, but other than that nothing seem to mesh on this show."
I do not like  many musicals. The idea of people singing will at work all day. Is stupid. Thumbs down on this one.
"If you aren't into modern musicals, you won't like this. If you are into modern musicals, you'll probably be 50/50 on this show. That doesn't leave a lot of room for the development of fans.A show about interns from around the country, working at a Huffington Post-esque web company, could maybe sort of work. But the singing is thrown in with the intention of making it stand out. It does stand out, but in a way that makes it entirely too niche to catch on for most people.From the very beginning, it just feels like a bad Glee ripoff. I would not watch this show."
"As a fan of high school comedies (Election being almost perfect) this pilot disappoints.  Nothing seemed real about it.  Juvenile teachers or actors imitating juvenile teachers, it was just dull.  Made me wince.  The principal has possibilities, but only if the teachers are much more on top of things than he is.At least two of the three teachers seemed like warmed over Joel McHale imitations.  Nuh, uh."
"The best I can say is that at least with this pilot, I made it more than half way through the program. The problem is that the more I learned about the characters, the less I liked them. Now I've seen some pretty funny sitcoms based in school (such as Boston Public), but at least then I could identify with the protagonists. In this case, I found myself not caring at all. Oh well, I guess you can't win them all. That's why we make pilots."
"This is not a well written show. It's unoriginal, the characters are bland, and it's not funny. It's not the worst of the pilots but it's near the bottom."
"I must be too old, this does not seem funny to me at all and I just stopped watching half way in."
"I think this show is OK. But I felt like it lacked the strong humor and cast of a show like 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia'. I also thought the main characters looked too much alike, which created an odd contrast from the diversity of the children in the school. While I found the show amusing, it's nothing special, I wouldn't go out of my way to watch an episode. I got the sense the writers were trying way too hard to be funny here."
NO. Amaz on made 8 comedies. Of them 5 were pure crap and 2 were mostly crap and 1 was partly crap. This fell into the first. It was not the worst of them but it is still crap!
"If you like Scary Movie or Date Movie or Blue mountain State, shows in that vain, you'll like this. I didn't laugh once, I didn't enjoy the banter. It's trying to do workaholics without being as talented or believable as those guys--not that workaholics is believable, they just have great delivery."
"This episode wasn't very good. Similar humour to Workaholics, but definitely not as funny.  If it got picked up, I might give it another chance.  The characters are decent and the premise might work, but not many of the jokes land."
"As some others have said, I am baffled about the high rating for this show.  I almost stopped watching at the halfway mark, having not laughed once, but then finished watching just to give it a chance.  The second half managed to make me smile once or twice, and that's it.  I really enjoy ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,"" but this, unfortunately, is like Sunny minus the strong writing and great acting (although what appears to be not-so-impressive comic acting may just be the result of sticking good actors with bad material).  And, except for the existence of bullies, it doesn't feel as if it's drawing from anything real about high school, either from the perspective of teachers or of students.  (I did like the principal's secretary -- but she's on for perhaps two minutes.)"
"Three male high school teachers have total disregard for their jobs, their students, and their superiors. Here's the punchline that ought to have happened in this show, ""You're fired!"" Dumb situations, drugs, anti-gay slurs and behavior, everyone misbehaves, no one has any feelings or gets punished for their misdeeds. I don't doubt some particular drug-addled viewership will like this kind of men-who-won't-grow-up kind of sitcom. If I had a remote to change the channel, I would certainly use it on this."
"This was an average American sitcoms. It made me laugh a few times, but it's not something I would watch if it became a series."
"I simply do not understand where all these 5 star reviews are coming from. I could see how this type of humor is not for everyone. But this type of humor IS for me - I'm a big fan of It's Always Sunny, Workaholics, The League, and all this aspires to be.But this is just not good. I think the problem lies with the actors? Primarily the history and PE teachers - they're not funny (what they're doing could be funny / the scenarios are funny in theory, but the performances are just not believable / real / authentic...which makes them not funny). I did enjoy the Spanish teacher though - he was quite good.Wanted to like it (particularly given how it came to be), but it just isn't good. I haven't read any positive ""official"" reviews [newspapers etc.] either."
"I can imagine the thinking:  let's get some self-absorbed characters to push some boundaries on the cheap a la It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  And I think there is some funny dialogue here but the actors are simply too obnoxious.  IASIP doesn't have likable characters but it has likable PERFORMERS.  These guys aren't funny, the aren't appealing, and I wouldn't watch them again.A lot of shows with middle-of-the-road writing are elevated by perfect casting.  This is middle-of-the-road writing crippled by terrible casting.  For all I know, these guys actually wrote the show, again a la IASIP, which is why they're here.  I don't know.  I didn't look."
Didnt NBC try this show already? What is this show going to be about? Here is the cast of the show:Lead singer from Likin ParkPoor mans nick swardsonsuper poor joel mchale.How is this rated so highly?
"This felt pretty average to me. It managed to get a few laughs, but I pretty much forgot about is as soon as it ended. The thing is, it's too much like several other shows/movies out there, ""Workaholics,"" ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,"" ""The Hangover,"" and for some reason it also reminds me of ""Horrible Bosses."" Basically three screw ups with crap jobs doing horrible things throughout the show. Been there done that. Instead of doing something unique, it's just cashes in on an already saturated genre."
"It seemed like a long 22 minutes but there were some occasional laughs.  Some in the cast appear talented. The humor is alternately slap stick and adolescent.  Just who do they see as their audience going forward?  I suspect it may be pretty narrow with this type of humor.  I would suggest they go back to the drawing board and re-think this. A couple of times I thought the show had possibilities but it kept lapsing back into silliness.  In the long run, that won't cut it."
Stupid movie! But it was in good condition it did come by the date given. I would purchase from them again. It's not their fault the movie is lame. But customer service was AWESOME!
"Sometime in the near future, some people get obsessed with celebrities so much that some companies start providing these admirers with a new way to get closer to their ""stars"": getting infected with the same virus as their favorite celebrities. Young Syd March (Caleb Landry Jones) works for the Lucas Clinic, a company that owns the exclusive rights for such super-celebrities as Hannah Geist (Sarah Gadon).I know this is a satire - not a very good one, but a satire nonetheless - so I decided to keep watching, ignoring the film's unbelievable premise. But when Syd smuggled the virus out of the company's lab by getting himself infected, I lost interest in whatever was going on. ""Antiviral"" tries to depict a near-futuristic world that is bleak and captivating, but with its underdeveloped idea the result is simply pretentious and boring.Caleb Landry Jones, better known for some movie fans as Sean Cassidy / Banshee of ""X-Men: First Class"" turns in a compelling performance, but his character is not given enough depth for the viewer to really care what is happening to him. Same can be said about the celebrity Hannah Geist (Sarah Gadon, who played Emma Jung in ""A Dangerous Method""), whose back story should have been much more interesting.The director's flair for visuals is on display throughout ""Antiviral"" with some stomach-churning moments that feel like going on forever, but what Brandon Cronenberg needs a tighter narrative and a less-is-more approach to the subject matter."
"Terrence Malick is one of those directors that I don&#8217;t always click with.  I know that he has a very large and supporting group of rabid fans and yet I have yet to be truly mesmerized by him since his debut, &#8216;Badlands&#8217;.  What I have always admired about Malick is that he tries to come at very deep rooted and intellectual subjects from a vantage point of almost complete detachment, allowing us to hover over these subjects without beating us over the head with them.  He&#8217;s focused on war and faith and death and celebrity and in each of these instances, even when I don&#8217;t feel the film worked as a whole, you find this otherworldly atmosphere thanks to Malick&#8217;s thickly laced scope of ideas.I&#8217;ve said this time and time again, but Malick is a director who tends to get in his own way.&#8216;To the Wonder&#8217; is, in my eyes, the most disjointed, distracted and overall uneven film Malick has directed.  While I&#8217;ve grown accustomed to his use of visual imagery and whispered voice over to create his &#8216;point&#8217;, the use of those images and whispers only reduced &#8216;To the Wonder&#8217; to an elongated commercial for Zoloft.The synopsis here is rather simple.  Neil meets the free spirited Marina in Paris, where he sweeps her off her feet and brings her and her daughter back to his home in Oklahoma.  Their relationship starts to crumble almost immediately and soon Marina and her daughter pack up and leave.  In her absence, Neil starts to court Jane, a former flame, only to have Marina crawl back home and convince him to marry her, leaving Jane out to pasture.  Marriage doesn&#8217;t fix the crack in their marriage though, and soon they find themselves at violent odds.  While all of this is happening, the Spanish pastor in their town is, apparently, struggling with his grasp on his own faith.I&#8217;m honestly not sure what Father Quintana has to do with this story, at all (completely reminded me of the useless Sean Penn segment in &#8216;Tree of Life&#8217;), but Javier Bardem was easily the best thing about the movie so I hate to say it should have been removed from the film.  In all honesty, this felt like a really bad editing issue.  Terrence Malick is notorious for chopping his films in half.  There was that controversy over &#8216;The Thin Red Line&#8217; where he actually cut Adrian Brody right out of the film, and he was slated to be THE STAR.  So, it&#8217;s no surprise that Rachel McAdams has like three scenes, but it is disheartening that the Father Quintana storyline feels like a poorly developed subplot.  There is absolutely no flow between these two storylines, despite having Marina briefly confide in Father Quintana about her relationship with Neil (and by &#8216;briefly&#8217; I literally mean for about five seconds).  Instead, these two stories feel ripped from two separate films and so I really feel like there is very important footage that was left on the cutting room floor that could have developed this into a more cohesive story.Or maybe Malick just wrote a story void of those essential bones.I think that is a major issue I take with this.  Even from a purely spiritual or emotional standpoint, &#8216;To the Wonder&#8217; feels vacant.  In dissecting the relationship between Marina and Neil, the film goes nowhere.  Their issues are never explored, their fights are never revealed and their tumultuous relationship is pretty much a repetition of pictures that reduce Marina to an obnoxious woman who prances around and wants to be tickled and Neil to a grump who pouts at the camera or walks out of the room with his eyes cast down at his feet.  There is no meat here, no actual character development and so we can&#8217;t care for them at all.  The spiritual angle of faith feels like an afterthought, since Bardem&#8217;s scenes are sparse and feel like such a tack on I almost couldn&#8217;t take them as part of the same film.Yes, &#8216;To the Wonder&#8217; is beautiful, but it has nothing to say."
"After visiting Marina (Olga Kurylenko) in Paris, Neil (Ben Affleck) brings Marina and her daughter Tatiana (Tatiana Chiline) back to the states with the intent of getting married and allowing Marina to get her green card. However their relationship hits a rough patch and Marina and Neil both find themselves traveling their own paths. Marina encounters a priest named Father Quintana (Javier Bardem), who seems to have a struggle finding his own happiness. Meanwhile Neil rekindles an old flame with childhood friend Jane (Rachel McAdams).It was difficult to anticipate a film like ""To the Wonder"" since Terrence Malick films are generally pretty abstract. ""The Tree of Life"" felt like half a dozen storylines competing for your attention and none of them felt like they were properly resolved. ""To the Wonder"" continues Malick's streak of featuring incredible cinematography in his pictures. Cathedrals, trickling streams containing slumbering rocks, walking along the beach, a rose bush covered in snow, and an endless array of impressive shots of the sky and animals in their natural habitat; a National Geographic special is like the secondary storyline to Neil and Marina's relationship.The narrative of ""To the Wonder"" feels extremely erratic. It's not that it can't decide who to follow or where to go, but the path it travels seems so random that it feels like someone just closed their eyes, spun around, and pointed and then followed that path for awhile before jumping back to the previous path. The characters are practically driven by indecisiveness. Neil doesn't want to be alone, but can't seem to commit. Marina wants to be with Neil and then she doesn't. She wants to live in the States and then she wants to move back to Paris. Father Quintana wants to help people, but refuses to help himself. Even when these characters get what they want, it's like a flip switches on inside and they can't accept it. It becomes extremely frustrating.What you end up with is constant visits to the drive-in restaurant Sonic, repetitive trips to the grocery store, and frolicking through grassy field that seem to last a lifetime. Affleck seems to only have a handful of lines and spends most of his time lurking about; pacing around, not talking, and looking disgruntled. There is something in ""To the Wonder."" Something about blossoming relationships always falling apart just when they seem to be at their peak and what appears to be two different lifetimes lived by one man. A priest is able to make others feel good about themselves yet is so empty inside and a woman is in love with a man who's in love with another woman. You're just kind of left dangling when it comes to Jane and Father Quintana and even though the story between Neil and Marina is given the most time its conclusion is massively unsatisfying.While it may be filmed beautifully, ""To the Wonder"" doesn't exactly move its gestating 112-minute duration along any faster with everyone on-screen galloping around their front yard or a field full of slow moving bison genitalia. So embrace that obnoxious ten year old of yours, hold a rooster, and lick a tree branch because ""To the Wonder"" is a romantic drama that wanders around so aimlessly it can't decide where to go next."
"""You got me out of the darkness. You gathered me up from earth. You've brought me back to life."" Neil (Affleck) is an American who is traveling in Paris when he meets Marina (Kurylenko) a divorced mother with a ten year old daughter. Striking up a fast romance they both move back to Oklahoma. Not long after the move the relationship begins to stale and when her Visa expires Marina and her daughter return to Paris. When she moves back Neil reconnects with an old friend and they begin to fall in love, until Neil hears troubling news about Marina. I'm not going to lie, the only reason I can write that summary is because I read it off of IMDb. I did watch the movie but I couldn't really understand what it was about, even after reading the summary I still wouldn't have guessed that was the plot. I also am not sure if the movie was told in present time or one long flashback. I did have a feeling this is what I was going to get going in though because this is a Terrence Malick film (his last one was Tree Of Life) and his movies are very different that everything else. There really isn't much I can say about this, mainly because I didn't understand what was going on. I can usually follow movies, but Malick's are much to smart for me. Overall, if you liked Tree Of Life or movies like that then you will like this one too. I just thought it was boring. I give it a C"
The photography and locations are wonderful but the actors are wasted in what is basically a very long ad for no product at all.  Lots of navel gazing and internal monologues regarding the breakdown of a couple.
"This show is a'right but what makes it difficult to watch is Stevie. He gives off a super creepy vibe, not only is he controlling but it is clear that he only see's these two women as either sex objects or means of making him money. He really is a gross modern day pimp. HIs daughter's mom needs to leave him and separate herself from his destructive ways. That Joseline women will learn her lesson in time, I mean he wouldn't even show her, her very own contractw- yeah controlling. Very scary that so many women get locked up into these types of relationships."
"There's nothing spectacularly wrong with this show, but there's nothing spectacular about it either.  There's not even really anything solid or good about it -- this is a show about on par with ""The Cleveland Show"" or whatever:  mediocre and instantly forgotten.  If Amazon, like Netflix, is trying to show off its ability to order pilots, maybe it doesn't have to break new ground, but it should at least strive to do better than what Fox has one eight times a week."
"The stop motion was great. The premise looked & sounded good, too.  There were a few funny moments, and several dead/boring ones.  Maybe it will get better over time."
"Conceptually this sounded like something I would like and I thought it might be along the lines of an animated Dr. Horrible, but I was very disappointed with the pilot. It just wasn't funny. The claymation was ok. The characters were mostly annoying and didn't make me form any sort of attachment."
This show was hard to follow so I wasn't sure when to laugh. Think it would have been better if the show had a bigger budget.
"Stopped watching about 5 minutes in, not at all interested.  Never grabbed my attention and the animation (even with the disclaimer) seemed really terrible."
"I really wanted to like this one. The premise of a stop motion cartoon about slacker storm troopers has a lot of potential. Unfortunately the whole pilot is incredible lazy. It's a lot of obvious stoner jokes (""Sorry I wasn't listening because I was SO HIGH. That's the punchline."") and jokes where the humor is supposed to found in characters talking about regular stuff BUT IN SPACE: ""You went to high school on JUPITER? I knew a guy there! I made out with him in his SPACE SHIP."" Not a lot of effort.Aside from the evil galactic middle manager who can't call his death star a 'Planet Buster' for legal issues, all the characters are really bland and generic too. The main character is another downtrodden everyman, his sidekick is a fat underachieving stoner, and the love interest is ""the girl who just understands."" Once again, not a lot of effort put into it.In fact there doesn't seem to a lot of effort put into any part of this pilot:  the majority of it isn't even animated; just an amateurish-looking animatic. I understand that animation, especially stop motion animation, is time consuming and costly, but if that's the kind of show you're planning on making, don't show me cruddy temp footage and expect me to care. It's too bad though, because the scenes that were fully animated looked pretty sweet.I'm disappointed to give this one a bad review. It seemed like a really great idea. But it was bad instead."
Love the team (Big Bang Theory) behind the show but the show has no where to go.  I am bored.
"I didn't mind so much that the animation was only partly finished. And there were some good voice talents in this (although perhaps not directed all that well), however, the writing was just sub-par. Wanted to like it, but could not care less about the characters, the story, the premise, or the presentation."
"The premise, a couple of future slackers become unwilling minions of the evil galactic conglomerate, is so clich&eacute;, so uber-PC, so lefty Hollywood snarky inside-joke stupid it might have been funny. Except that the jokes fall flat or are flat out distasteful (""I'll get you a hooker with five vaginas""). For heroes we have a fat, dorky stoner and his friend, an even more pathetic, down on his luck looser who is looking for love. Hilarity does not ensue. The highlight of the episode, and the stand-out in the cast, is the rebel chick. Unfortunately she comes with a stereotypical self-absorbed, narcissistic pretty boy sidekick--a total poser who loves to get stoned and quote Chairman Mao. Instead of being witty Dark Minions is banal; instead of being edgy it is foul mouthed; instead of being good it is simply bad. What makes shows like Big Bang Theory geeky and good is they have real science jokes and plot devices, matched with sympathetic characters possessing depth and believability. This pilot has none of those characteristics."
I was so un-impressed with the preview I didn't even watch the pilot. Sorry but animation has been so over done the past few years that it just doesn't hold the same draw for me that it once did. Another miss in my book
"I didn't laugh once through the entire episode. I think I smiled a couple of times but that was a bout it.  Not a bad concept, although not all that original, but not well executed. Just not funny."
"Most of the jokes are retreads from other sci-fi comedies and-or drug movies. the animation was fresh, though, but that was all because the writing needs re-tooling. Most of the writing was significant when it was in mel brooks', BLAZING SADDLES (ah, yeaah)!the two stars are for the animation because it reminds me of, SPEED RACER, and the claymation, such as, WALLACE AND GROMMIT, JASON AND THE AROGNAUTS and JASON AND THE GOLDEN FLEECE. i liked that stuff."
"I feel like this isn't the right venue for Dark Minions, but then again, I'm not sure what would be. It's not quite off-kilter enough to be an Adult Swim comedy, though it does have moments of very Robot Chicken sensibility; It's too weed/cursing focused to be a show for adolescents, though I feel like with a little adjusting down, this would go over very well with the 12-15 set; It's got a little too much plot to be a video game, though I think a Ratchet and Clank-esque platformer with these characters would be pretty funny and have endless options for gameplay. Given that 75% of the show is still in animatics, it just screams unfinished, but I think that extends to the thought about the show as well. There are some great laughs in there, as a Galactic Overlord dealing with normal people needs and (to even greater success) bureaucracy is just inherently funny, but the weed jokes are lame (as they are most of the time), and something about the format (both claymation and the storyboard animatics) just doesn't play well to most types of humor. There's a kernel of a good idea here (and some great voice acting work by Richard Kind and Clancy Brown), but I don't think this is the right outlet."
"Designed for the tech employee who feels their creativity is stifled by working on mundane coding or trouble shooting networks, and riding off of the Star Wars rift (rebel alliance fighting empire kind of thing), this show doesn't offer anything new or unique.  The theme here is that if that tech/computer-person, who is likely a sci-fi fan, is feeling down in the dumps about his job, then the solution is to hook up with some hottie to ""fight the system"":  Or, in lay-speak, get a woman to make your life feel easier.That's not such a bad message, but it's nothing new, and it's tiring.  That, and the the humor is predictable and fairly flat.  Maybe it's because I'm an older viewer who's heard all the jokes, or maybe it's because as a science fiction fan I didn't find a whole lot of science in this fiction and didn't think the setup all that unique, but I didn't so much as grin at any of the humor.Well acted, well animated, good concept drawings, well staged, I'm sure this program will find a niche audience, but it feels a little spartan in the writing department (that, and drop the space nazi at the five minute mark who hands out the cyanide capsules...or make him something other than a paranoid Bavarian knockoff).It's not a production I would back."
"The show seems like it struggled to get off the ground, the storyline tried to be adult-oriented, but is too ignorant and simplistic to attract its target audience."
"I was hoping for something funny, but this one didn't work for me.  I found the Boss to be quite funny - but the two main characters were not only *not* funny, but ranged from annoying to uselessly annoying.  Too many cheap jokes, not enough really funny stuff.  Unfortunately, I can't recommend."
"This pilot, although not fully fleshed out, just felt like a flat Tripping The Rift. Not to much to impress or care about in these characters."
I guess I don't watch much animation which is oriented at adults (at least that's who I thought they were aiming for)and after watching this it would still hold true. The idea of the show is different with the two main characters earning their living with the galactic conglomerate. It starts out in stop motion/claymation but then switches to cartoon animation. (If I read it correctly it's supposed to be all claymation if the show gets picked up but don't quote me.) Either way I just wasn't interest enough to continue watching further episodes. It just did not hook me in.
"I viewed several of these comedy pilots and none have achieved mediocrity status for me.  As with the others, there may be some potential but there just isn't enough quality humor to justify anyone putting money into this at present.  Concept is a little vague and writing (the key inadequacy of most of these efforts is the writing)is spotty at best.  I've watched House of Cards on Netflix and while it is not a comedy the quality is vastly superior to what I've seen here. If it is Amazon's intention to compete with Netflix in developing their own programming it is like a Rookie League taking on the Major Leagues.  Since I regard Amazon as a generally high quality operation I can only suggest they go back to the drawing boards and focus on upgrading the products."
"Didn't the Onion News already have a failed TV show and a terrible movie?  Why are they trying this again?  Would work better at 15 minute length at 1am on adult swim.  so far not impressed with the pilots Amazon, NBC would crush you in the ratings and they suck."
"My issue with this series and for the &#34;Onion News&#34; in general is that they believe that crass humor is the way to go in their fake reporting. While people do seem to like some of this I do not. I find it offensive for the most part. When a company thinks it is okay to attack a young child that is up for an Oscar you start to question their taste level. This show made me question it further. What could have been a rather interesting &#34;News Show&#34; pilot falls flat because of its attachment to the Onion News. I enjoy the actors in other shows and even enjoyed the introduction of the segment producer that I hadn't seen anywhere else to date, but this is not the show for them to find their next move in the business because simply put it is a horrible show about horrible people. There was simply nothing redeeming for this show because of how crude and crass it decided to be."
"I really enjoyed the Onion News Network and was disappointed when IFC cancelled it.  Was hoping for something like that here as a second chance.  Or even Sports Dome.  Wasn't expecting it to be a serial comedy instead of a parody.  Maybe the creators wanted to go a different direction because they were tired of being cancelled.I won't knock it for that.  But it was too frenetic and disjointed for my taste.It came off more as MAD magazine than anything else.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I was just hoping for more satire and less wackiness.A lot of great talent well played.  A lot of funny lines.  But I was gritting my teeth more than laughing.If this were up against fewer shows that were better, I'd like this to have a shot.  But I would rather other shows like Alpha House, Betas, or Those Who Can't get the shot over this one if it comes to that."
How is it that such a funny periodical can never be that funny on TV?  The shorts on their site are considerably better than any of the shows they've put on television.  Even with gloss and star power there's no denying that this is supremely underwhelming.  Too bad.
"I have high hopes for this, because the onion were really funny. I watched it till the end, but when the credit rolls out, I dont think I care to watch the next episode, if they have any. It has some funny moments, but It feels like it was just... okay, nothing special that makes me care about the show. I like Jeffrey Tambor from Arrested Development, and the other guy from 30 Rock, but this pilot fet like it needs something more, imo."
"I love the Onion's website but it never seems to work in long form. They've tried full length TV versions in the past and they haven't worked. This one has a better cast than their previous efforts but it's still only funny for the first few minutes. If this were a 10 minute show instead of a half hour it would be OK, but then it would be no different from the website. They should rethink this program, just doing an extended version of the news broadcast from the website is doomed to fail, they need to go a completely different way. The National Lampoon, which had was the same type of publication as the Onion, didn't try to reproduce their magazine when they did movies which is why they were so successful when they changed genres (Animal House and Vacation are classics while the original magazine is unknown to anyone under 50)."
"Sorry I can not describe it much, couldn't watch it for very long. Its just not the show for me."
"I get the characters, don't care for the individual actors.  This story concept has been done far too many times."
"This is a perfect example of how hard it is to be silly and stupid yet still be brilliantly funny. The movie Airplane pulls off that feat with panache, while by comparison Onion News Empire is left fluttering limply in its wake. Watching this pilot, I could almost hear the conversations in the writers' room -- where perhaps some of this actually sounded funny -- with each writer trying to top the other, until rising levels of absurdity completely squelched any actual creative dialogue. Having someone say or do something ridiculous is, in and of itself, not humorous. Jeffrey Tambor comes the closest to rising above the meager material, but even his comedic gifts cannot save this show from itself. To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, when it comes to this show, ""there's just no *there* there."""
"A few of the jokes were funny, but an entire show like this? Not for me. I just didn't get the world it's created."
"Was all ready to eat a rib eye steak at the fabulous new restaurant....only to find out they only serve vegetarian food. Eh, this show is not for me. It started out ok, but the snippets of humor developed into a desperate reach. It became weird & cheesey. Kinda like when your Grandpa tells jokes at the table on Thanksgiving. You only laugh out of sympathy, but can't wait to get the heck outta Dodge! It moves along at a quick pace, but couldn't keep me interested long enough to want more. I won't be watching it. Check please!"
I found this one a bit wierd. It was hard to grasp how the characters were so hard souled.  I still wonder why I watched the whole thing.
"Most of the jokes were fake headliners, which maybe only made me laugh once. I didn't like how it was shot either. It's hard to explain. It has this hand held camera sort of thing going on and a dark and gritty look. It didn't mesh well with the jokes for me. The story was pretty uninspired too. Kind of bland."
"A few funny jokes but that's about it. I don't think it's sustainable over the long haul. I'd watch it if there wasn't anything else on, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it."
I love the Onion site but not this tv show. I wanted to like the show but could not it was just not as funny to me. They do a lot more riskier jokes on thier site I think.
"The jokes in this show come at you really, really fast, but they start to become tired after a while. I felt like this show was trying to be 30 Rock, but lacks the character it needs to generate better dialogue between the characters. This show, like Alpha House seems to be more concerned with being a satire rather than getting people to care about its characters, or develop an interesting story."
"As a fan of The Onion I had high hopes for this but it let me down big time.  The best part of the whole things was the girl reading the news over the closing credits.  Other than that it just seemed like a bunch of scenes spliced together from other ""zany"" comedies.Besides, isn't a spoof of television news completely redundant given that Fox News is already on the air."
The actors try to use foul language to make up for a generally poor story line. I watched two episodes.
"John Goodman played my favorite character of all time, Walter Sobchak, so this pilot caught my attention above some of the others. Unfortunately, it's not very funny. It just seems to be a lot of ""Aren't Republicans dumb? Isn't that funny how dumb they are?"" jokes. I'm not partisan at all but funny is funny, and this wasn't."
"I love John Goodman.  I just don't happen to like the style of humor in Alpha House.  It strikes me as too obvious, not particularly clever, just doesn't make me laugh.  But this is just about my taste.  I am sure their are millions of other people out there who will like it just fine.  Seems well produced, acting is good, etc."
"And most of those opportunities were wasted.  The actors are good, but the writer(s) should have been getting shots in on both parties.  Instead it was all shallow hits to one side that was so over the top that it lost me 10 minutes in.  I watched the whole thing, but just because I was really needing to fill some time."
"This only superficially has any resemblance to the real life experiences in the software industry.  This is a very fantastical script.  It's like they didn't use one technical consultant.  But, being as betas is produced by Amazon, that is unlikely.  So, betas must have been deliberately dumbed-down and hipsterized for some reason.  Smells like the writers are trying way way way too hard to be hip and trendy.  betas is total fantasy."
"A group of extremely stereotypical &#34;nerds&#34; comes up with an idea for a facebook &#34;killer&#34; app, joins a &#34;farm&#34; of other beta products being hosted by an &#34;industry leader&#34;  (Lord help me if I ever run out of quotes) and there you have it.All about getting the &#34;beta&#34; out the door as a product and the struggle to get it done.You have the classic disheveled outcast that overindulges in things and gets in trouble on twitter, et. al.The Nerd with a bit of business acumen who tries to connect with some sort of female technical reviewerThe female reviewer who is hard as nails, but really is a softie with an oversized libido underneathThe Indian coding genius, who has no social skills and latent / unconsummated homosexual tendencies is going to get thegroup in trouble.The geeky uncoordinated guy, who has the hots for one of the female members of the team.And the elder statesman, who is overseeing all of this.Nothing new there to me, seen it tons of times before and done considerably better (revenge of the nerds, real genius, hell, even sneakers)Since I've had experience (30+ some years in the IT industry), the boy claims I am a geek/nerd and should love this thing as he sees it as a &#34;heroic portrayal of all people technical&#34;.I view it more as episodic cheap shots that if it were a comedy about minorities, they couldn't get away with today."
"This is an insult to anyone with half a brain.  The excessive foul language IMO shows a total lack of originality on the part of the writers.  The second star is because this is not a bad idea, however it is badly executed."
"The geeky indian just feels like an Abed knockoff from Community. I didn't care about these people. The wiseass had his moments, particularly in the bathroom talking about his age (although I would peg the actor as being closer to 45 than 35 in real life)I liked the ValetMe app idea better than the BRB one. An app to help you find parking spaces would be really helpful."
I checked it out since I'm a big fan of the Big Bang Theory but I guess I'm not nerdish enough for this one. I guess I'll have to pass if it actually ever comes to TV.
"This show felt like it was trying to be a lot of different things, yet succeeded at none of them.  It was never quite funny or entertaining to me.  I liked the one actor from a previous episode of Workaholics, but the cast just never clicked for me.  There are funnier alternatives to Betas out now that deal with the same technology world."
"The Indian kid from Safety Not Guaranteed is so whiny it's painful whenever he's on screen. Jon Daly's character is a kind of macho-douche character like Adam Carolla or Dane Cook, and he's a better comedian than that. The high school bully kid from Workaholics is just whatever. He doesn't stand out. The handsome main guy doesn't either.The jokes are pretty raunchy but not clever. ""I eat so much tuna I'm like a lesbo!"" etc.I could not care about anything that happened to the characters. Despite the interesting setup, underdogs in Silicon Valley, the situations they wound up in were pretty generic sitcom stuff."
"Where is the creativity, the genius, the work ethic of characters who say they are proud because an alcohol induced courage allows one to go on stage and perform with no talent?  This &#34;comedy&#34; may mirror what some think is the nature of their lives, but it is in very sad in that it seems to limit all that there is and does not allow any characters to rise above the pedestrian life they live.  This is a soap opera about limitation the victims a technically advanced society creates and gives them an excuse for their limitations because of the society that has created them.  Perhaps there is a degree of truth in this series, but it does not rise to the level of comedy in a contemporary sense."
This was one of the pilots that I knew that I would like.  However I was surprised that 12 minutes into the pilot I hadn't laughed and I wasn't interested nor invested into any of the characters.  It wasn't bad but no where near my expectations.
"The Big Bang Theory guys are lovable, geeky losers.  Not the Betas, except maybe the lead actor, but I found the rest of the characters obnoxious.  Maybe this is supposed to be Entourage in Silicon Valley?  Well, on paper it sounds like a good concept but it was not executed that well.  I wouldn't waste my time on this show if it became a series."
"Not for me as an adult.  I loved the concept because the subject interests me, but this has sunk to the level of lewd, rude, and crude. I'm sorry to say I don't find it entertaining.  However, I have watched only one episode, so I will check one or two more to see if it begins to appeal to me.  Right now, I think its intended audience is teenagers. It has potential for a much broader appeal, but I don't think it will reach for that."
teen age boys talk about sex all the time. not alpha males. small confined work space no privacy or quiet.
"Watched the first three episodes..Didn't laugh once. It's uninspired. The writing is corny, the cast is too mismatched, unappealing. Felt like a public access ensemble - anyone who showed up to audition got a part...I won't be watching after this.. A murder she wrote marathon would have more substance and coherent dialogue. I know Amazon is just starting out with this tv venture, but so far, 0 for 0..and yeah, I saw Alpha House too..That's not much better than Betas.. I've also noticed that both shows are taking the PC thing to all new levels.. every race is being represented. It's obvious to the point they are trying way too hard, that it's a turn off..Kinda like the ways commercials on network tv are all coded in such a way now that it's almost reverse racism... Diversity is a great thing when it happens naturally.. but when it's forced..it's feels that way.. and it's not only uncomfortable, it's annoying.. Oh, and not one gay character on the Amazon shows..unless you count the self loathing closet case who is the bunt of the show's jokes..like it's 1985 or something....Poor Amazon.."
"started out good nice looking lots of fun now to much of course , may be for a younger audience."
"Despite the Silicon Valley being visited a few times already in Film and Television, it remains a setting for useful storytelling and characters we have never seen before. Yet from the pilot I saw, it's another yet another cliched send up of the high school/college crowd. The socially awkward nerds and geeks who can't get woman, the disgusting slob/slacker who looks at porn and wants to ''get some''. Even the older character portrayed is like this on several films and television series.For the reasons I stated in the opening sentence, I do hope this show succeeds. Yet it needs a LOT of plot and character development!"
"I'm not involved in the IT world so I think Geeks, Nerds & Techies are leaving the positive feedback because they relate more. I get the sarcastic banter & wit....but I didn't have that LOL moment that I thought I would. It fell flat & left me disappointed. I can see people relating to this show....but not me. On to the next."
I watched some of this story.  Not too inclined to make it one of those got to watch the whole series type.
"Granted I'm not a geek, but I do appreciate them and enjoy watching shows about them. I think Beta lacks a strong main character and the others are not that exciting. The matchmaking theme seems a little underwhelming for true genius geeks."
I found the pilot sophomoric and iterative of The Big Bang Theory. Nothing original here. Found myself looking forward to the end.
"The actors are second rate. The pace is too slow. Everyone, writers, actors, and director must have been on Valium drips when making their contributions to this show."
"Got the concept - apps, techies, cool nerds, but the show is boring, slow and predicable... And the supposedly shocking and offensive materials just bring it down more."
I looked for the humor. Didn't find it. Was it hiding in the code on one of their computers? Seriously a snoozzzzze fest. Like Ed Begley Jr but the whole series should not move forward. Admittedly I'm not in this age bracket anymore but do work in tech so at least some of this content I should have found delight in however sadly I did not.Next.
"It must be an age thing. I could not get past 10 minutes of this. The charcters were unlikeable, the writing not funny. I'll pass on this one."
"I actually wanted to like this one, and I kind of did, at first. The story of a couple guys pushing their new, potentially revolutionary idea into the tech market was interesting. There were some funny parts, but not as much as I would have liked. I was enjoying this pilot half-way through until I realized it's basically the merger of ""The Big Bang Theory,"" and ""The Social Network."" You got a group of hyper-intelligent guys (Big Bang Theory) and they have an awesome idea that will probably make them millions, (Social Network). Even some of the characters are suspiciously similar.Realizing this, I just couldn't get back into the show. It feels like I'm being pandered to and I hate it. ""Hey! You know those things that are really popular right now? Let's imitate that!""I just wish some of these pilots would have taken a chance and do something different instead of retread ground.Despite my bitching, I would probably watch one or two more episodes and hope that it will deviate from what we're already familiar with. But as it is, I'm pretty disappointed."
"I'm sorry in advance for being frank, but the cuteness of Maya Erskine and Margo Harshman hardly makes up for the ugly cast that makes up the rest of the actors, which made this hard to watch. And why did everybody's eyes look like they were about to burst out into tears? Also, this seems like the kind of series that would just keep dragging on and on. If it were a movie, it'd be fine - you'd watch it for 2 hours, and then it'd be over. But as a series, the plot just doesn't have the potential. Many will say that the road to commercializing an idea is a long and twisty one, and I don't disagree, but I just don't think it's one that would make good television; especially not as a comedy. The silly romantic interests of him and her are just a cliche attempt at distracting you from realizing that there isn't enough in the story alone to keep you entertained."
"This is one of those shows that you watch when you don't really have anything else to watch.  It's just ok.  It's not one of those shows that will make you want to pick up your phone and tell a friend that they HAVE TO SEE how great this show is.  Once again, it's just ok.  I won't lose any sleep if there isn't a Season 2."
"I can acknowledge the potential this show has. I can recognize the humor. I can appreciate the appeal it might have with the right audience. I, sadly, am not the target demographic for this program."
"There is no substance to this show.  It just shows some kids interacting in a large room, but what is it about.  Supposedly they are very smart; however, we never see any evidence of it.  I'll leave it to some young high school age folks to enjoy.  I'd expect to see some real antics like on &#34;Real Genius&#34;, the movie."
"This did have some good parts, and I like the basic premise and the cast of characters, but it needs better writing."
"I found Betas to have mostly unlikeable characters who are rude and crude. I do not appriciate their unkept bodies, peeing on the street, sex, sex, sex inuendos and lude behavior. Yuck!!!!"
This was my least favorite of all the pilots I viewed. The tech jargon felt overwhelming. The love interest story felt forced to attract the women. I didnt really care if they ended up getting Ed Begley Jr's help or not.This show just wasnt for me.
"The show couldn't keep me long enough to find out if characters are likeable, becauseI stopped watching the pilot after 10 minutes.Wasn't funny to me......"
"Run,nay flee from this piece of trash.Alas,silicon speak is not for me.Endure it not for there is no plot.Close your eyes and it will go away."
"Why did Gil John and his assistant's accent get thicker as the episode progressed? That is the most interesting thought I had while watching this show. If you like political dramas/comedies I suggest House Of Cards on Netflix as it is 1 million times better. Also HoC is much funnier even though it is technically not a drama. This seems like it was meant to be a CBS show and when they found out it was going to be on the internet they sprinkled some F-bombs over the script which is flat and not memorable. I could not relate to any of the very one dimensional characters and the humor wasn't there, seems like it couldn't decide if it wanted to skewer members of the GOP of appeal to them and in the end I don't think it successfully did either. The Bill Murray scene is the funniest thing in the whole episode and his character is quickly removed from the show. Super pass."
As many have mentioned in their reviews as well... the slant of this show was unbearable. This could have been done without specifying either party... or at least spreading the scorn around.
"Everyone I've ever known swears and/or cusses, but there's a time and place for everything, and I'm of the opinion that not ALL of our publicly elected officials swear.The zany antics of our legislatures isn't even funny, much less have an ounce of realism.  A lot of production personnel and audience members may be jaded in that they don't believe that the trust of public office is deserving of some reverence, but I do.If this was based on something substantiated, then yes, I might go for it.  But the premise of the show is that the representatives put on a show for show's sake, and everyone, even their constituents, are in on the gag.  If that's the case, then why bother with elections and this show at all?It's one thing to mock the political system, and it's one thing to throw up caricatures, but this goes well beyond that, and just trashes the whole thing with teenage humor for what used to be the adult time frame and career.I'm really sick and tired of these shows.  No, I didn't watch the whole thing, and I further believe that all they do is foster more of the same.  I wish people would tune out this kind of trash.I wouldn't back this thing, even if I had all the money in the world."
"Nothing to really say except more Bill F***ing Murray! Without him as a regular, this is a big turkey. I like all of the actors, but the comedy seems very forced - like it would make a great SNL skit, but anything longer gives the viewer time to realize that the concept is very 1980s."
got it - republicans are dumb and bad dems are good and kind... yada yada - too bad because i like the idea
The best comedies are caricatures of life. The Senators portrayed in Alpha House are less caricature and more true to reality to be funny. The show just magnifies the sad state of American politics today. Don't think it would last a season.
"I've only seen the pilot and one other show in this series, but I don't get it. Why in the world would we want to watch a show at night that reminds of the news from Congress during the day?"
"It's getting old; a comedy about politicians who do nothing but drink and chase and scheme to get reelected.  John Goodman's character is not likeable and that is the worst part.  He can liven up most anything, but it doesn't work here."
"I sat through the pilot and have a policy for TV programs that if the pilot doesn't blow my skirt up, I do not continue watching.With great political shows such as House of Cards (the new one on Netflix, not the British one) and the historical West Wing, Alpha House just doesn't do it for me.Yes, this show has some better moments; some of the lines are good, but overall (and compared to other content available), Alpha House will not be on my list of regular programs to watch."
"I watched 4 of the episodes and couldn't take it anymore. Why on earth do they have to use such foul language in every other sentence? I can swallow some of the behavior they were showing, but I think they went way overboard on some stuff. Although there were a few funny parts, most of it was rude, crude, and just plain awful."
"The idea of a political comedy sounded great. I'm a political junkie and need some comedy in my life. Unfortunately, this series isn't doing it for me so far. The problem is that the characters act like a bunch of idiots rather than real people, much less politicians. The show tries to get its laughs through buffoonery rather than wit, whereas I think wit is much more appropriate for political comedies. I don't expect 100% realism from comedy, but for a concept like this to work I'd think the characters would need to be at least more plausible than the characters of the Hangover movies. Too often characters did something that was not only incredibly dumb and predictable but also not funny. I found myself less able to invest in the show and eventually stopped watching after a few episodes. If you're looking for intelligent comedy, this isn't it."
"I was hyped when I saw John Goodman's name attached but very disappointed with his character. This show missed the mark by a long ways as the content was dated, not all that funny and really not that interesting. I would guess that if this was on a network channel it would get cancelled about three or four shows in. A definite no on wanting this as a series on Prime."
This show was funny at parts! But boring for the most part! There was way to much cursing that was unnecessary to make it funny. The constant cursing took away from the storyline of the show! The black guy was the funniest part of the show! The storyline didn't hook me to make me want more right now! Probably wouldn't watch another episode! :(
"I had such high hopes with this team and cast (who were all very good). But it's just beyond boring. I couldn't finish it. I might try again as this idea could be ripe with smart humor, but right now, it's not. What a shame."
"I love the cast and political comedy.  I thought this would be a big hit with me, but I put it on and somewhere around 15 minutes in, I fell asleep.  Thinking maybe I was just tired, I tried again the next day and realized, I wasn't tired, I was bored.  In a world with Jon Stewart and Steven Colbert, political comedy is right on target.  Your cast was phenomenal.  Maybe it was the writing?  Please, if you produce more, make the plot tighter, the laughs bigger and more salient and the videography a little smoother."
"I didn't laugh once while watching the pilot episode, which is really sad considering Goodman's talents.  They jammed every Republican stereotype into one episode and tried to pretend it's funny.  It's not.  I am very disappointed and will not watch another episode, and if I can keep one person from watching this tripe, my review will not have been wasted.I gave it an extra star because the acting and the production values are very good, even if the show is terrible."
"Edit 12/8/2013 This looked like such a promising show but Episode 2 was so bad I could not eve finish it. So changed my 5 star to 2!!!Funny cast, great script just please do not overdo the storyline for the new guy....loverboy would become old very fast, actually was already played out in the pilot. Will keep an eye out for more episodes hopefully"
"Let me get this straight ... a bunch of jackass Republican senators who have no real convictions but end up on the wrong side of every issue is supposed to be a sitcom?  Two problems with that ... we can all see this ridiculous s*** on a little program called ""the news"" every day ... and second if there's a joke here it's on the American public ... and that's not funny, it's sad."
"I'm a little hard to please when it comes to comedy because I've watched so many.  I just didn't think this was funny.  I didn't laugh until the very end when it finished with the wrestling match with Colbert.  It has talented actors but flat out needs better writers.  Since the show has promise I hope it can be fixed in a hurry.  If not, can it."
"I like the Daily Show and Colbert, but don't want yet another show that just makes fun of republicans the whole time.  Especially when they're just fictional republicans who can be made to say and do whatever ridiculous and despicable things the writers want (I feel like that's cheating)."
Feels like this is somewhere between West Wing and Veep; can't decide if it wants to be serious or funny and the compromise leaves it in limbo.
"Loved the cast especially John Goodman,but the premise of four senators living together was totally unbelievable.Still looking for the comedy and had a hard time finding it."
"Interesting seeing the 'inside' of politics, acting is good, but do not enjoy the constant 'f' words, or the mas ter bation scene. Mark Consuelos plays a man whore, giving a woman oral sex in one episode. Guess this is what television is coming to."
"I found the constant profanity to be more than I wanted to listen too. I'm a fan of John Goodman, but the profanity was too much."
"Alpha House isn't my cup of tea.  It was dry, liberal humor, designed to make fun of Republicans, and it does that with tired, old stereotypes.  Bill Maher fans might find this one amusing for a few episodes."
I like Guy Pierce. I feel for the plight of the orphan. But the premise just didn't pull me in. Pierce is usually connected with good films but the awful start to this one doesn't offer anything to pull the viewer into the story.  Enough said.
"I love good humor. I love clever humor. I love stupid humor. I even love good raunchy humor. This show is none of these things. It's barely funny. If a few high school kids came up with this stuff, it might be funny. But not from an adult. I guess if Dane Cook can be famous so can any other idiot!"
"Don't quit your night job Amy! As a stand up comic, she's wonderful. as a sketch performer she's just bad. Trying to adapt one paragraph comedic stories into a sketch is an art, but every good artists knows where his or her staengths are and what they're mediums are. Picasso didn't draw with crayons, or finger paint, Amy Schumer shouldn't do sketch comedy."
"My problem is, I am too old to appreciate the raunchy side of her humor anymore.  My grandson laughed but he is in his late teens and not often exposed to this type of humor so the shock value was higher and the vulgarity funnier to him.  Thank you."
Slow and not overly funny. Segment clips are as long as the comedy clips.
"I usually love Amy S's raw, pushing the envelope, but this just wasn't so funny. I had hoped for more stand up bits and less pseudo sitcom vignettes. Darn....hoped for more"
"A very dumb, intellectually, show for teenagers and if I were a young male I would be insulted identifying with this guy - he is stupid."
"Full Disclosure:  I didn't even make it halfway through the first episode.  I'm a fan of Bo Burnham, but the character of Zach as outlined in the first few minutes of the first episode is so conceited, so clueless, so pompous and self serving that I couldn't stomach him, and cannot see why anyone else in the series gives him the time of day.  EX:  In the first episode, a friend of the family dies and  Zach decides the funeral will be perfect for showcasing himself on his &#34;reality&#34; show.  Yuck.  Again, I'm a fan of Mr. Burnham's stand up, but I hope he finds something to do that I can sit thorough."
"Once upon a time, Francis Ford Coppola made movies like ""The Godfather"" and ""Apocalypse Now."" He also made ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" but that doesn't eclipse his accomplishments.But Francis Ford Coppola clearly has entered the ""I'm going to do whatever I want, even if it makes no sense"" phase in his career. Exhibit A: ""Twixt,"" a baffling little movie that twines together ghosts, vampire bikers, child murder, Edgar Allen Poe and a big messy knot of subplots that may or may not be real.I once tried to summarize ""Twixt"" to an acquaintance, and ended up babbling incoherently about Poe, vampires, ghosts and dead children. But I'll try to tackle it anyway: Second-string horror author Hall Baltimore (Val Kilmer) is touring for his latest novel, and ends up in a small town that doesn't even have a bookstore. That evening, he encounters a strange, ghostly young girl who calls herself ""V"" (Elle Fanning).He soon finds that strange things are afoot in this town -- time seems to be frozen (none of the clock faces move), there is a gang of bikers who may be vampires camped out on the lakeshore, and the ghost of Edgar Allen Poe visits him in his dreams to reveal half-forgotten secrets. And what does all this have to do with the recently-murdered girl lying in the police station?It's really hard to even pass judgement on ""Twixt"" -- it would involve understanding what the director was trying to do... or thinking... or understanding ANYTHING. It feels like Coppola had four or five different ideas for stories (""Vampire bikers! A vampire/ghost orphan! Dream messages from Poe! A failing author with personal issues!""), and so he squashes all of them into one movie.The result feels like a mad hybrid of Stephen King and David Lynch. The small-town setting, the supernatural threats and the eccentric characters feel somewhat like something King would put in a story... but the way it's presented is wildly Lynchian, with giant lumps of misty symbolism and blurred borders between fantasy and reality. You could watch this movie a dozen times, and still not be sure what is happening.For instance, one scene features Baltimore wandering into a blue-lit bar, where he listens to two people who speak in an affected, dreamlike way and occasionally sings ""The Big Rock Candy Mountain."" After one of them attacks V, they babble some more about how the clocks do not work and time cannot be measured... and Baltimore just leaves. Utterly baffling... and no, it is never referred to again.I suspect that Val Kilmer was just as baffled, because that's effectively the performance he gives -- total confusion. He does a decent job with Baltimore's frustration and grief over the problems in his life, but most of the time he's left staring around in confusion. Elle Fanning isn't in much of the movie, but she does do a good job as a girl who may be a ghost, a vampire, a dream, or whatever.But one thing that Coppola does not fail at is making the movie beautiful -- it's a misty, night-hued story that drifts over lakes, through ruined stone walls, through moonlight-dappled forests. Some of the greenscreen is a bit obvious, but it doesn't distract from the hauntingly lovely, surreal visuals that fill most of the movie.Francis Ford Coppola has become the elderly winemaking version of people who make amateur horror shorts and put them up on youtube. ""Twixt"" is utterly baffling and bizarre, but at least it's a pretty kind of baffling/bizarre."
"It sure looks good, but man, the plot is so muddled and slow. I'm ok with weird films, but it was like watching a painting and expecting it to tell you a story with the pretty colors. I was able to finish the film, but the ending didn't satisfy me."
"I admit that I didn't watch the final episodes, as they turned Michael into a murderer. I watched the show to see a hero, not another tired anti-hero like on some crappy AMC show."
When I saw the start of this once entertaining series it was exciting and entertaining but the last two seasons have become sadly the weakest for this once entertaining series. I still find the cast enjoyable and some of the episodes and action is still decent but the plot and finale for the final season was the most weakest written from the writers of the series and sadly left me with more annoyance on the series ending then any sort of satisfaction.I understand the writers and producers felt the need to wrap up the last season quickly but that has become their fault on making this season the least liked out of the entire series run.So if you already have the previous seasons I say stick with those and just forget the seventh and sadly least entertaining season you won't be missing much.
"If one earthquake could destroy an entire South American city, and unleash the worst of humanity to wreak havoc on innocent people, then don't go. I'm not sure what the message of this movie is, except that South American cities may have lax building codes, and many old buildings, that are ready to collapse. I guess that's true, but the rest of the story seems to be some kind of portrayal  of the consequences of sin, and the risk of chance. If you enjoy watching humble people suffer, this movie is for you."
"Leave it to Eli Roth (director of Hostel) to keep his record intact involving absolutely disgusting movies.  In this one, he plays a dad touring Chili (I think) with two other dudes--Roth's idea of a manflick, I suppose--and constantly trying to hook up with someone.  Trouble is, Roth's character is so gooberish, he would have trouble hooking up at a hookers convention, but I digress.  He and his buddies finally make it with some American chicks to supposedly the ultimate party when disaster strikes in the form of an earthquake.  Suddenly, it's now about how to survive the disaster.  That premise alone might have worked for the film.  What follows does not.If you're asking what follows, I'll give you a little clue:  it seems that during really hellish times in Chili, i.e. MAJOR earthquakes (not to mention that bells are sounding to alert the locals of an apparent tsunami), you now have to worry about thugs crawling the streets who are out to do nothing but rape, torture, and pillage.  That seems to be Roth's speciality, and he is just not content with showing a little carnage; no, the viewer must get the entire buffet.  We have people who are doused with gasoline and then set ablaze (even though they're already crushed by falling rocks), we have impalements, and, oh yeah, we also have a very violent rape.  I understand libido, but if I have to choose between sex and survival, uh, call me maybe?And the ending is about as much a surprise as finding a cherry inside a chocolate covered cherry.  I hope the 12-year old that gave Roth the suggestion at least got credit and payment for his thought.  Rated ""R"" for very good reasons, this is NOT a movie for anyone under 18.  The rape scene alone should have garnered an unrated rating."
Really was disappointed with this film. The crazy rapists on the loose theme that came up was lame and laughable. A couple of the death scenes were well done but I thought it could of been much better.
"Not a good sign when the build up for the film was some of the better parts of this Disaster/Torture Porn movie. Eli Roth presents: Some South American guy's idea for a horror film, and while he does deserve credit for coming up with an original idea that was pretty neat in theory, a lot of stupid decisions happen after the aftermath that took me far out of the film.So the Positives: Acting was good (enough), most of the characters had enough depth to them to make their roles passable (except for girl in white dress who did nothing), and there was some good set-up (which is usually the low point for these films). The story was unpredictable and the ol' ""who gets killed first"" list was pretty unpredictable. So yeah, Aftershock at it's best is unpredictable and original, with interesting ideas for a story.Now for the not so good: Pretty much everything after the first friend dies. While the movie was unpredictable, everything that happened afterward was predictably cruel and unusual. Especially scenes that were basically ""stay here while we get help"", which happened at least three times with the same results: bad stuff happens. The bad stuff, is mostly caused by a small gang of prison inmates released after the earthquake, who seem more focused on rape then escaping far from prison or even regarding their own safety during the aftermath of the earthquake. Nope, instead they chase down our 'heroes' for the entire film after s*** hits the fan. If I were a prison inmate watching this, I'd feel insulted.Also the characters act pretty dumb and slow for most of the movie, when people need help, they awkwardly fumbled for 5 minutes or so until they realized the obvious solutions. They do other dumb s*** throughout the movie, like when one of them's told to stay put, and stay quiet, he immediately phones someone and gives away his location. When a hysteric woman is pointing a gun at someone and threatens to shoot, the character starts walking towards her. When *spoilers* an inmate is dressed as a firefighter, he plays a rather convincing one that would contradict his actions, helping the men and trying to isolate the women with him, so he can... kill them? ...ok. There's a lot of head scratchers like that throughout the film, which not only pulled me out of the immersion, but also made for a rather dumb movie with pointless excessive suffering. Hence, the Torture Porn element that Eli Roth is known for. The problem is, the story could've been fine without the murderous rampaging rapists. S*** they could've even been a local gang or something, but even then, maybe just one scene with them being a threat. But being chased the entire movie by the prisoners? C'mon...So for a horror/disaster movie, it was certainly original and unpredictable, which is very welcome for the tired and stale genre. I'd probably watch the next film by South American dude, since there's some potential here. But next time he makes a movie, cut out the stupidity and unnecessary torture, because it's getting pretty stale."
"First of all, this is an Eli Roth film. If you don't know who he is, he's the man responsible forCabin Feverand the line ofHostelfilms, all of which are grim, violent movies. (Leader of the ""Splat Pack,"" some journalists have dubbed him.) CABIN FEVER I actually enjoyed, but only because it had a sense of humor about what it was doing, and you get the impression from some of Roth's other work (specifically some of his cameo appearances as well as his work with Tarantino) that he doesn't take himself too seriously. That's to his credit, because when your movie is an onslaught of relentless doom, gloom, and death, it helps to toss in a joke or two to help soften the blow or else you end up narrowing your audience down to masochists, suicidal goths, and aging serial killers who miss the good old days.This movie is about a random group of people in Chile who experience a massive earthquake and then must deal with the horrific aftermath, including aftershocks, looting, crumbling buildings, and general anarchy. The movie is notable for refusing completely to follow any kind of traditional story conventions. I can't decide if they were trying to be avant-garde or if they thought it would lend the story (as much as there is any kind of story) more impact, but a lot of choices left me scratching my head. For instance:-- Nothing happens for thirty minutes. We meet three guys -- Gringo is white and Ariel and Pollo are Spanish/Latin American -- who are partying hard down in South America. They party and talk about/hit on girls and dance for about thirty minutes. There are a few stabs at character development (the white guy has a daughter; the fat guy has a rich daddy who's funding his fun; the skinny guy is obsessed with an ex-girlfriend), but mostly nothing happens.-- Approximately 60-70% of the dialogue is in Spanish, and at least in the version of the movie I watched, there were no subtitles. I actually looked around for a version with translations, but I couldn't find any. If you know Spanish, you'll get more of the movie than otherwise. It's not that hard to get the basic gist of what the Spanish-speakers are saying (maybe this decision was meant to make non-Spanish speaking viewers as disoriented as the foreigners in the film), but it is also off-putting.-- Protagonists? Forget about it. There seems like there could be, but ultimately isn't, any kind of lead character that you can hang your hopes on or root for. The film starts by following the three guys, but people join and leave the group intermittently as the disaster causes them to run for their lives. Maybe they thought that if audiences realized anyone could die at any moment then it would give the movie more tension and suspense, but what it really does is make it impossible to get too attached to anyone at all, making the chaos and killing even more mind-numbing.Relentlessly nihilistic to its final frame, this movie is only entertaining if you enjoy watching people suffer for literally no reason at all. At least with the Hostel films (at least the first one), you could argue a point is being made about the corruption of power and wealth, and there's definitely a hero figure who satisfies even a splinter of the audience's empathy. This film, however, has no deeper message (other than that life sucks and then you die) and no satisfying level of personal engagement unless you have the heart of a barbarian and get your kicks from vicarious raping and slaughtering.I give the film points for most of its actors doing decent jobs (Roth's general aura of smugness implies that he's a much better actor than I think he is) and for also pulling off a lot of horrific stuff with an obviously small SFX budget, but the overall film is so brainlessly dark and despondent that it made me wonder how anyone with such a vision in their heads would also have the motivation to put it up on the silver screen. Seems to me anyone with this kind of outlook on life would be more compelled to take a bath with a toaster than actually write a script about it. Movies are usually made to a) tell an interesting story, b) entertain, or c) teach lessons about life. This movie doesn't do any of those things unless you think the cold, tarry abyss of your waiting grave is a) intriguing, b) enjoyable, or c) a profound morality play. If you do, congratulations, you're among this film's target audience and should enjoy it. Otherwise, I'd steer my ship to calmer waters if I were you."
"I have watched other Eli Roth movies.  I actually looked a bit forward to watching this one.The movie spent more than 1/2 it's 90 some minutes giving us a good look at each of the 6 major characters.I can deal with this if the movie is worth it.  It was NOT.Spoiler****I seldom do spoilers, but here, I am trying to save you time and money.The movie allows us to care for the 6 people.  Slowly, 5 die.  I am kinda used to that one.The last girl, the smart one, gets out and to the beach.  This would have been a good ending.However, a tsunami then kills her and the movie along with it.No redeeming value, only shock and disappointment.Watch something else."
"Two fun loving guys (Ariel Levy, Nicol&aacute;s Mart&iacute;nez) and Gringo (Eli Roth) meet a hot Russian model and her two European friends while vacationing in Chile. Character is built for half the film, about 10 minutes too long. We get to know the characters fairly well in this time and they are all flawed. The earthquake hits and anarchy reigns supreme as criminals escape from a prison.Outside of Nicolas Martinez as a Chilean Zach Galifianakis, I found the film boring, even with the young hot chicks. I didn't feel the horror or terror of what is more like a bad street snuff film.Not recommended even as a rental.Parental Guide: F-bomb, rape. Brief nudity-Male butt nudity, scrots, woman with pasties."
"Every aspect of cinematography, acting, plot, script, direction - just fails.  A plot as old a my grandmothers wall paper and just as shoddy and worn.  Nothing new and poorly presented at that.  There is so much better available to spend your time on this this, seriously just pass this one by."
"I went off the reviews saying this movie was good. I disagree, I couldn't even finish watching the movie. I tried watching it for a good 40 minutes. I just couldn't get into it."
Admittedly did not watch it all the way through.  What I did watch did not interest me.  Maybe it is a good movie just not to me.
Horrible acting mixed with a stupid story line made for hilarity in this supposed horror movie. I do not recommend this unless you want a good laugh with a disappointing end.
"Not starting out good here. storyline ok, if not overdone. Acting by all except Mischa Barton was like bad soap opera acting, especially Rebecca De Morray. She chewed up every scene she was in. Mischa is actually a good actress and deserved better than this.but, taking the acting away, worth watching on a rainy day."
For as long as I watched it was mostly a one woman monolog. I got bored watching her react to noises in the background and talking to herself.
"Janet (Julianne Michelle) is moving out. She is happy to get away from her alcoholic controlling mother (Rebecca De Mornay). She is elated as she moves into her apartment. After 15 minutes she wants to leave. She discovers a woman killed herself there, the super is a pervert, the apartment is haunted, and it smells. Her boyfriend comes over (Corey Sevier) but that doesn't help.The film spends a lot of time building up character with stale dialouge. The creep factor never grabs you. The ghost make up wasn't that great and the spooky scenes were too well lit. It seems they missed the key elements to make a decent ghost story.Might work as a rental.Parental Guide: F-bomb, one sex scene. No nudity. Julianne Michelle bra/panties. $9.96 Walmart."
"Watch this film if you enjoy the following: collagen-inflated lips trembling hysterically, a Rebecca De Mornay (looking as if the last few year have not been kind) attempting to sing, lots of really bad acting, pervy landlords and creepy next-door neighbor girls (hanging around for no apparent reason), one of the most embarrassing ""love"" scenes on film, a boyfriend that looks like a young Billy Ray Cyrus with the IQ of a cucumber (also hanging around for no apparent reason), more bad acting,  an ""evil & angry spirit"" that looks like a dude in drag (again... hanging around for no apparent reason), reality-show grade dialogue and finally a completely pointless haunting combined with zero motivation for being in the silly apartment in the first place.The scoring and cinematography for Apartment 1303 3D are like ordering steak & lobster at McDonalds (at least someone on the payroll for this film earned their check) and so I felt like a 1 star was a bit harsh."
"Nothing new here,. just boring, and the only good thing about it is Rebecca DeMornay, who is always great."
"This guy Santini rips people as often as he can.  He guesses at everything and when they do their &#34;certification&#34; all it is is him and other people guessing.  No documentation.  Also, he does these death defying escapes that are comical.This show is highly staged and corny."
"Throughout all of filmdom, there's some debate about when the cop buddy film actually came about.  Most critics seem to accept that the contemporary version of it was a product of 1970's and 1980's filmmaking, and I figure that's probably more right than wrong.  If the buddy film didn't originate somewhere in those two eras, it certainly made its most significant step forward culturally during that time.  That said, JAVA HEAT feels more like the outcome of someone trying to recapture that dynamic for an all-new generation of movie-goers.  While some may find that admirable, I'd just rather go back and re-watch all the great buddy films of the past than have to sit through an inferior retread any day of the week.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Jake Wilde (played with `beginner's luck' by TWILIGHT's Kellan Lutz) is a teacher's assistant who finds himself in the most unlikely set of circumstances one could imagine: he survived a terrorist's bombing in Indonesia and is how having to be a witness for local detective Hashim (Ario Bayu).  But Jake's problem isn't the attack; rather, it's that he's not who he says he is, and the two men will have to join forces in order to stop a terrorist named Malik (Mickey Rourke) from absconding with `the Crown Jewels' and a beautiful sultan princess he intends to sell into sexual slavery!And therein lies the chief problem behind so very much of JAVA HEAT: its patchwork story.  None of these characters - not Jake, not Hashim, and not Malik - are every clearly defined so that an audience can either understand much less identify with them.  First, Jake's a teaching assistant; then he's some international FBI terrorism expert; then he's some AWOL military policeman.  As best as I can honestly tell you, his last identity is the only one that sticks; it's finally made perfectly clear in the film's closing sequence, but, by that point, should I or anyone really care?Stylistically, it's hard figuring out what to make of JAVA HEAT.  Its performances are stereotypical and predictable; its action pieces have all been done before; and its message of East triumphing over West appears as if it can only happen these days in similar cinematic fairy tales.  Its story is all over the map in terms of indicting the global society on behalf of the Indonesian people, and that's probably just what writer/director Conor Allyn intended: convince everyone that anyone but the Muslims are to blame for the shape our world is in, and you've done not only a good thing but also the right thing.  Has he and his co-writer Rob Allyn never heard about Sharia Law?  Oh, pardon me for perhaps stating the obvious because anyone with half-a-heart and a motion picture production crew knows better.Unfortunately, so much of JAVA plays out like a bad cup of coffee.  What little story there is makes no sense, and I have to wonder how much of this was actually left on the cutting room floor.  I say that because there's a scene about thirty minutes in wherein Lutz's character says to Bayu's character, ""Hey, didn't we do great teamwork back there?""  (I'm paraphrasing.)  He's also given his Indonesian counterpart the nickname of `Hash' (short for Hashim).  The chief problem with this sequence is that we've yet to see these two actually work together in any way, shape, or form.  Clearly, something has been either removed to give this exchange its meaning or something went completely unfilmed; and a competent filmmaker and/or editor would've noticed the obvious storytelling gaffe and actually done something to fix it so that the narrative made sense.  It doesn't, and I spent the rest of the film realizing that this may've been by design as the script feels like a visual stew: it's all chocked full with scenes, plots, and characters excised from vastly superior films.Methinks the filmmakers hope the audience isn't watching too closely; that way, they're much more likely to enjoy JAVA HEAT.  They'll be stupefied to the action, or the young ladies will be suffering the vapors from seeing Lutz's naked body.  Me?  I just wanted it to, at some point, start to make some narrative sense.  Instead, it ends up feeling about 104 minutes way too long.JAVA HEAT is produced by Margate House Films and Margate House (???) along with some participation by IM Global and Zero Gravity Management.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group and IFC Films.  As for the technical specifications, the film looks and sounds pretty solid, though there's a measure loss of audio quality in a few scenes (not a huge distraction).  Also, the film played as an ""Official Selection"" of the Dallas International and Taormina Film Festivals.  As is often the case with these smaller releases, there are no major special features to speak of save a short `making of' featurette and the theatrical trailer.MILDLY RECOMMENDED.  Despite a lack of effort, JAVA HEAT isn't entirely a complete waste.  Granted, that may not be saying much, but it's the truth.  Stylistically, it's a throwback to a time when action films were a bit kinder and gentler.  I've no doubt it'll impress audiences who don't look too closely; my problem may very well be that I do look closely, especially when it comes to storytelling.  Still, this is a Hollywood wet dream: the bad guys are the Americans, the French, and the Chinese, while those Sharia-lovin' Muslims are all just misunderstood by the rest of the world.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at IFC Films provided me with a DVD copy of JAVA HEAT by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
"The action thriller ""Java Heat"" isn't necessarily a terrible movie, it just ends up being entirely forgettable and somewhat empty-headed.  The movie looks like it will be a contemporary political puzzler, but never makes the most of its exotic locale and intriguing premise.  What might have been an intricate and relevant look at religious strife and political maneuvering quickly goes somewhere far less interesting from a plotting standpoint.  And when all the truths are revealed, my gut reaction was ""who cares?""  On the plus side, the movie is set in Indonesia which provides for plenty of local color.  The action sequences are well executed, even if there aren't any real stand-out moments.  And the movie features a really appealing lead performance from Indonesian actor Ario Bayo as a local detective.  My principle negative, though, (aside from a rather mundane story) has got to be Kellan Lutz in the biggest role.  Lutz is a man committed to a mission, supposedly with plenty of secrets and savvy, but ends up coming off like a frat boy throughout.  He never demonstrates the smarts necessary to believe his character.  It's like he's making a buddy cop comedy and no one else is, so he seems completely out of place.The tale begins with Lutz in custody after a bombing which left the Indonesian Sultana dead.  As the woman was to be her country's future leader, her untimely demise has long range political repercussions.  Although suspicious of Lutz and his story, the detective in charge (Bayo) is thrown into cooperation with the American.  Lutz is not being entirely forthcoming, however, and his actions bring him to the attention of criminal mastermind Mickey Rourke.  As the investigation is leading to the unscrupulous Rourke, he takes counter measures.  Soon, there is all out warfare with many innocents in the crossfire.  As you might expect, there are plenty of fisticuffs, machine gun shootings, bombings, kidnappings, references to illicit sexual encounters with underage participants, and other manner of nefarious activity.  Just who is Lutz and what is his agenda?  What is Rourke's motivation?  As I looked forward to having these questions answered, I was thoroughly underwhelmed by their resolution.It's always good to see Rourke.  Here he is mumbling all of his lines in an ever changing accent.  When I could understand what he was saying, I was wondering what country he was supposed to be from.  His villain is colorful, to be sure, but lacks any nuance or believability.  From moment one, he is seething and over-the-top.  And Lutz is truly perplexing.  As this is set in the seamy underbelly of polite society, you'd think that our hero wouldn't be completely naive.  At one point, a man asks if he wants to solicit the sexual services of a girl, a boy, or a lady-boy.  His cartoonish and shocked reaction is laughable.  His flirtations with the Sultana are truly painful too.  And when a stranger hands you a drink in a bar and you're on a very important mission, maybe you shouldn't swill it down without a second thought.  These are just a couple of moments that stand out, but his actions are perpetuated by nonsensical acts or inappropriate behavior.  I don't blame Lutz entirely, the screenplay can't decide on the tone to adopt.  Is ""Java Heat"" supposed to be lightweight and comical or dark and disturbing?  I still don't know.  And by not deciding, the picture fails to connect on either level.  KGHarris, 9/13."
"Not since ""Rush Hour"" has there been two more mismatched investigators. Jake Wilde (Kellan Lutz- Matt Damon light) teams up with an Indonesian policeman, Lieutenant Hashim (Ario Bayu) to go after the killer of the Sultana (Atiqah Hasiholan). She was the Princess Di of Indonesia. Malik (Mickey Rourke) soon appears as the bad guy who uses reluctant Jihadists to steal art and jewels.The plot doesn't have any real twists, although the identity of Jake changes from scene to scene. This is a ""me too"" crime action drama that never grabs you because the characters are written so bland. I felt like I was watching a serious Bollywood production without the dance numbers. The film has some interesting scenes, but for the most part is not worth a rental.Parental Guide: No F-bombs. Brief male nudity (Kellan Lutz glute)"
"I am going to admit that this is the first time i watched Teen Wolf. So this is the review for people who are thinking about getting one DVD in a continuing series and catching up. I'm sure there are plenty of reviews for people who have been watching the show from the beginning and want to know if they can expect great things or disappointment.But as far as I can tell, this show is about a lot of pretty white twenty-somethings who are pretending to be high school students and keep turning into werewolves and killing each other. In one episode, they are on the school bus the whole time. In another episode there are references to red eyes and green eyes. Everyone is talking about alphas. The Greek letters are like the semi-finals on Glee - they sure make sense for people who care. Not much for casual viewers.There's also a lot of mood music being played. And the town has a lot of people dying. It's one of those fictional towns where the murder rate would be high in a major metropolitan area and yet no one moves away.There's also a flashback episode where both storytellers are outright lying. That one has some wit.Beyond that, the characters all look alike. Sure, there's the cop from The Wire playing a veterinarian. However, everyone else looks like an Ambercrombie & Fitch model and there's no way to tell them apart. I understand that this is MTV and its audience is more superficial than most, but does EVERY single character have to be blandly good looking without much variation? It would be much easier keeping the people straight if you they included an Asian character, a black &#34;teenager&#34; (everyone in the show looks like they have books about quarter life crisis tucked away) or even a character that is fat or &#34;Hollywood ugly&#34; (Rachel Leah Cook in glasses would be a variation as far as this show it concerned.)If you love this show, I'm sure you'll be fine with it. I don't know. If you are curious about this show, you would have a better time playing with Barbie and Ken dolls. At least Barbie and Ken dolls have personality."
I was pretty sure it was before I even started watching it. My daughter talked me into it so we watched it. I started reading a book about halfway through.
"I so want to like this show!!! second season begins with one of the book stories, one I found particularly difficult to swallow. In it, the sheriff makes one lousy decision after another, each one compounding the previous. the situations are so preposterous that the episode becomes laughable, which is not what the writers intended, i'm sure. The cast is good, i like the casting of everyone, but it just can't seem to get going. the characters and situations have no depth, they just skim across the surface, sadly. the beauty of the books is the backstory and the interaction between vic and longmire, and bear and longmire. both of those relationships are drastically changed int he tv series, much to its detriment. additionally one of the best elements of the story, the reclusive indian (cannot remember the characters name) is missing entirely from this version. ugh. just terrible. won't be purchasing any more episodes."
"I watched some of the first season and was interested enough to track down the books.  After reading the books I can't stand to watch the show.So much of what they changed are things I look at and think ""Oh, they're copying (insert popular show) "".  All of the characters are sadly twisted versions of the ones that quickly catch your attention in the books (and make you care and wait anxiously for the next book so you can find out what is happening with them now).  They dropped some of the best characters and kept others that only showed up in a single book.  And the main characters bear only a passing resemblance to the ones from the books.I know a weekly television show cannot capture everything a full length novel can, but even popcorn has to have some substance."
"While I really like the first couple of .asons, the spark of the series has died, and this terrible cliffhanger makes me not want to even tune in next year"
"Plots are interesting, but I continue to be fatigued, even irritated by the sassy main character who comes off as having no depth of character in the face of these fictional tragedies. I don't plan to watch anymore."
"This was one of my favorite TV shows, but to have the series end with Jim lying on the floor wallowing in his own blood was a bit much.  I would recommend all but the very last episode.  If you DON'T watch that one you'll probably like it okay."
"They had an opportunity to keep alive a good premise, but it has no character. I am comparing it to the BBC series though that had its own issues. If you didn't see the BBC series, you might enjoy it but I am not sure what the other reviewers saw to give 3 or more stars. The writing and character are just meh, it does not seem to have any life to it. The show may have taken it self too seriously and did not bring any real personal development to the characters. They should try again although maybe they should use the Battlestar writers. Note the BBC series states 5 seasons , but it is more like 2.5 and the 3rd season was a disaster with the 4&5 trying to find its footing."
Love the show; Hate some of the content.  I'd give the show at least four stars if it wasn't for G** D*** said in several of the later episodes and Toby having a lesbian kiss in episode 7 &#34;Babes in the Woods&#34;.  The language and sexuality were unnecessary to the story and were gratuitous to the plotline.
"This plays like a made for tv movie - VERY LOW budget, no more than 10 people in any one scene, and they do make Christians look bad.  It was an easy watch though and maybe worth the dollar rental.  *spoiler alert* - ending of the movie was actually how it should have started - they show a mass of Vikings getting ready to go into a big battle, start yelling and running and.........movie over."
"King Bagsecg (James Cosmo) is on his death bed. He tasks his son Steinar (Charlie Bewley) to find his older brother Hakan (Elliot Cowan) who had been banned. Steinar travels with a group of men to find Ivar (Ivan Kaye) who may know his whereabouts. Steinar has a brother (Finlay Robertson) and half brother(Theo Barklem-Biggs), neither of which are warriors.Ivar prefers the companionship of young boys. The film utilizes grindhouse style in its introductions and fighting. Both the Vikings and Saxons have British accents. I thought the Vikings had thicker accents. There were numerous anachronisms in the speech, slang, and general ideology. The ending of the film had me scratching my head as it turns into a bizarre apocalyptic Mad Max scene.I do not consider this a pseudo history in the same vein as the others that have been released, it is too far off the track.Makes for an odd historical rental.Parental Guide: F-bombs, nudity, no sex."
"""You don't know what you are, but you will."" After refusing to kill an innocent boy, Steinar (Bewley) is passed over for king for his brother. When he turns out to not be a good leader the kingdom begins to lose order. The people of the kingdom look to Steiner to help them. He sets out looking for his brother Hakan who everyone thinks can restore order. Along the way Steinar begins to change and becomes the man his father was hoping for. I have never really been a big fan of the 300 type movies. I'm not sure why but the whole mid-evil genre just doesn't do it for me. That said, this movie wasn't really that bad and is worth seeing but when there is no action going on the movie really begins to slow down and I start to lose interest. There is enough action to keep you watching though, but the movie really starts to feel flat about a half hour in and never really picks itself back up. Fans of this genre may like this but I thought it was just a little too slow to stay fully interested in. Overall, another 300 rip off that feels flat. I give it a C+."
"The actors do a good job, the story is relevant and interesting. However, the rhythm seems off. Also, there are major inaccuracies with the immigration system/rules in addition to numerous inaccuracies with other details, and that probably turned me off."
"The actors are mediocre, the action is quite slow, the story jumps from plot to plot, &#34;Col&#34; Weaver is hardly active in this season, unexplained things are happening such as a part &#34;alien baby&#34; born to Tom and Dr. Glass, infection of the new young doctor with the alien bugs, and on and on. Very boring!!!"
Little plot development & slow moving I fell asleep trying to watch this one. Not really worth the time or energy.
Too much on the long deep philosophic speeches during crisis that just require grabbing your butt and heading out. We got the deep connections after the first 10 minutes.  Coulda been good. Too forced.
They blew it. This is not The Killing of seasons 1-2. It has the moody atmosphere of the Pacific Northwest and that's about it. Holder (Joel Kinnaman) is the only saving grace. The Linden character needs major therapy. Gregg Henry's character has some funny dialogue. But there's not enough of him. Halfway through the season I couldn't care less who did it. And what's with all the smoking? Everybody smokes feverishly. Is the show now set in the sixties?  Maybe the producers thought they were shooting Mad Men. I'm going to check out the follow-up season of the original Danish series to see if they had better luck extending the franchise.
"The first two seasons were brilliant and I had high hopes for this season. Unfortunately, the acting is uneven - whoever plays 'Bullet' is so bad that any scene with her is hard to watch. Too bad she is in so many scenes. If you want to do the show a big service, kill her character off quickly, like next week. She just cannot act. Never have someone who doesn't smoke pretend to unless they can do it convincingly, which is hard and which this actor cannot. This is just a small complaint, the actor really has little skill overall. Clothes and a haircut do not an attitude make.Too, I feel the structure of the show - the pacing - is not suited to this season's plot line. It worked for Rosie but here I just do not find I care enough about the characters to sit through the pained expressions, the unbelieving supervisors etc, to watch with the same intensity as I did the first two seasons.The writing is not as good, the plots weaker, the acting uneven and the main characters have even become wooden and predictable. Shame to say it , but this is a format that should count itself as one of a new breed of 1-2 season-only shows. Brilliant in that format but now painful for its inability to realize it no longer works."
"DRAMA is getting old! I don't even know why I purchased. I've been a big fan of the show but with Caroline stalking her boys (which she swears she's not doing but it was so freakin obvious!), Melissa flat out doesn't like Teresa that much is obvious. Teresa is jealous of Melissa's relationship with Joe, that much is obvious! Jacqueline is having a nervous breakdown on the show. I also feel very bad for Teresa. Especially with the legal troubles she has going on."
"little disappointed, same stuff, they working to hard to make it seem like everyday life.  It all seems to be just for show.  I have stopped watching them after this."
"Its a recycled season, brought all the players up to Manitoba to drive like morons on snowy roads, big deal.  The only reason it's dangerous is that the drivers are nut jobs.  I think IRT has seen better days and now it's just hanging on. I'm done with it."
"Nothing fresh except some of the acting.  This will be too slow for a lot of people.  No pay-off in the end, which is what I like in a movie."
"I wasn't expecting a joyful show when I started watching this, but it was stranger than I imagined it would be. The show is pretty vulgar and doesn't hold back with much of anything...although I must admit I only watched the first and part of the second episodes - I just couldn't watch anymore."
I thought I would like this show because it had a good cast but I found it very difficult to get into with a sluggish plot. I guess it plays well for a limited audience
After 20 minutes we turned it off. We just don't care for foul language that never seems to stop.Not worth our time to finish watching.
"Al Pacino goes to heroic lengths to add some stature to this mess, but even he cannot lift it off the ground.  The supernatural slash hallucinatory scenes would normally add a lot of snap crackle pop to most films.  But here they just seem gimmicky and tacked on.  It presents the mid 1980's in a cliche revisionist way.  This is audience manipulation of the worst kind."
"*Some spoilers ahead, read at your own caution*Before the first word is spoken, I'm given the impression that this is just like the previous V/H/S, in that there's next to no real story in the main story, just excuses to have women take their tops off and have people swear very heavily. Then a touch of story does appear. A young man being sought out by private investigators and find that he's missing... and instead find a collection of strange videotapes. Unlike the previous collection, something strange will be happening in the interweaving narrative of the main story. The anthology on the other hand...Phase I Clinicals seemed like a total rip-off of The Eye, where someone gets an eye implant after an accident and, because it's a new method, is warned there may be glitches. Those glitches include being able to see ghosts. The only person that knows of them besides the patient is a woman (who, besides her knowledge and her cochlear implant, seems like she's only useful in the story for a sex scene). Frankly, this is the only story that actually gave me jump scares. But still, this seemed too mainstream with overt predictability throughout.A Ride in the Park is basically nothing more a first-person view of zombies. A man riding his bike gets attacked by a zombifying woman and becomes one himself, who ends up attacking a cuple after he dies. Sadly, when said biker and couple meet together, they look clumsily/comically cheesy, stiffly moving. It would likely get Romero to roll his eyes. That said, there was less than a handful of moments (in the end) that gave this a hint of originality- no, wait, it actually made me think of David Moody's Hater trilogy (where you get a glimpse of zombies through their own point of view).Safe Haven is a documentary-style video of a trio getting into a cult compound (think Jim Jones meets Heaven's Gate meets eastern philosophy). Most of it is in some Indian dialect (don't know which one), with a few lines here and there in English. During an interview, a woman speaks of a secret that only one of the interviewers knew of and that unravels secrets about each other, which inadvertently connect to the biggest secret of the cult's Father. Overall, it was the most disturbing (even if it didn't have any jump scares) because of sleights to pedophilia and how it deals with suicide cults and religious extremism.Slumper Party Alien Invasion seems to have a feeling that's reminiscent of a mix of old-school Spielberg and King. A group of kids, after messing with one of the kids's big sister and her boyfriend, end up having to defend their selves against an alien invasion. Paradigm shift? The camera, towards the end, goes to the perspective of a camera hooked to the family dog's back, so when it ends, it does so in a completely depressing way.In between each video is the main story being played out in bits, but each bit does have a better story than the nonexistent crap that served as the main story in the previous movie. Though, in a way, it seemed like they picked their cues from The Ring and Pulse. In fact, it seemed like there was authentic originality in any of the stories herein. If they make a sequel, I do hope for actual originality, a pretty decent storyline, and videos where women don't simply serve as lust factors but as actual human beings (it's become a cliche for a woman to bare her chest in a horror movie, but I don't think the people who made this know that).Overall: 1.5/5"
"For those who saw the first &#34;V/H/S&#34; this &#34;sequel&#34; has a buddy cop duo looking in a house to find out what happened to a young man, course they find some VHS tapes and without even thinking or likely cause of boredom they pop them in the working TV and VCR. Each tape has some fairly graphic but downright goofy material. I'll keep these as spoiler free as possible.&#34;Clinical Trials Phase 1&#34;-In a new effort to give someone sight, a guy has a camera put in his eye socket so he can see and of course this will record what he sees. He didn't count on being able to see more than he wanted to see (like figures in his own house no less), at least there's a pretty girl who shows up to explain her own dealings with an experiment similar to his. Not a very good one here.&#34;A Ride In The Park&#34;-A young man goes riding in the woods, with a camera on his helmet of course, some lady is vomiting and well he ends up bitten by her. Soon after he turns into a zombie and all the zombie flick lovers get a first person view of how the undead see us all. This is a bit above the first one, but well still isn't that scary.&#34;Safe Haven&#34;-A film crew is wanting to probe the mystery of an Indonesian cult, after being allowed to come to the compound and film it becomes quickly apparent the leader has special plans for one of them. This is a bit longer than the other &#34;tapes&#34; not a bad one, in fact probably the best of what's featured here. Acting is at least a little better than the first two, with a lot and I mean a lot of violence especially towards the end.&#34;Slumber Party Alien Abduction&#34;-No this isn't some 70's or 80's campy horror/comedy (very well could've been) but what happens when beings from another world come after us. It's not a terrible scary one, none of the characters are likeable, save one but well the best &#34;actor&#34; doesn't meet the best end. Not very good.Before the first tape and in between each following one we have more stuff with the cop duo, which goes from boring to just downright goofy. The ending in particular is comedic and almost promises a sequel is coming. *1/2 out of 4 stars"
This movie was ok.  Ending was lame.  I should have waited until it hit Netflix or something cheaper. Rent it if you want to feel confused.
"""A lot of you have posted, it only affects you if you play it in the correct sequence, but I've been experimenting..."" Two investigators out looking for a missing student enter his house looking for clues. What they find is a room full of TV's and a laptop. When they start to watch what is on the computer they begin to get a sense of what happened to him. I have to start by saying I wasn't a fan of the first one so I was not all that excited about seeing this. This does have the same basic idea, just a series of short movies tied in to a missing person plot line. The movies get progressively worse though. The first one dealing with an eye implant isn't that bad, then there is a zombie-like one. There is one about a suicide cult that is more sad then horror and the very last one is just laughable. If you liked the first one then you will like this too, otherwise this is one to avoid. Overall, just because you have gore in a movie doesn't mean it's good...or a horror. I give it a C-."
This is a movie that greatly disappointed me.I thought it would delve deeply into what happened with Bradley Manning's attainment ofdocuments and their subsequent release to Wikileaks (Assange) and then the world.  It wasmore of a personal criticism of both Assange and Manning and very uninteresting and biased.Do not waste your time or money.  The secret they steal is that this is not a movie worth watching.
"I guess that if you read the description of a film called Rapture-Palooza and watch anyway you should know what you are getting into...and that is pretty much what it delivers. Surprisingly, the language and constant sexual profanity are more offensive than any jabs they actually take at religion or the rapture (from a religious &#34;satire&#34; perspective, there are many &#34;comedies&#34; that are much more offensively pointed out there). Even more surprisingly, there are some pretty funny moments and one-liners, but you have to put up with quite a bit to get to them. Overall though, the funny just isn't funny enough to balance it out and justify sitting through its relatively short 85 min runtime."
"There are exactly two laughs in this movie and both of them are talking crows.  Danny McBride should have played the beast/antichrist.  He could ad lib funnier lines all day every day.  Craig Robinson can be funny, but here he's trying way too hard, as if he knows he's stuck in a straight jacket forces him to hit the same note and wasn't given time or freedom to expand the role."
"I really wanted to like this movie, but it was a pretty bland comedy. Nothing special about it. 'This is the End' was much better. When God sends the rapture, all the good people go to Heaven and the bad people stay on earth and deal with fireballs, locusts, raining blood, pot smoking wraiths, and a zombie that likes to mow his yard. Lindsey and Ben soon have to deal with the antiChrist named The Beast (played by Craig Robinson) Pretty much half the movie is just Robinson talking dirty to Anna Kendrick and showing her awkward reactions. One thing I didn't appreciate was how God was portrayed. They made him a douche (odds are, this movie was made by atheists) If you're gonna spoof God, at least make him respectful like Morgan Freeman in the Bruce & Evan Almighty movies. I would not recommend RAPTURE-PALOOZA!!!"
"This story centers around Lindsey (Anna Kendrick) who has caught the eye of the portly foul-mouthed Anti-Christ (Craig Robinson) who prefers to be called ""The Beast."" Her complaining mother has returned from heaven, having been kicked out of the rapture.The idea was clever, especially how man learns to calmly deal with the various plagues thrown his way. I enjoyed the Maddow joke as well as the ""fowl-mouthed"" crows. The humor was spotty. The jokes were rather lame and juvenile. The writers came up with a half decent plot but couldn't execute on dialouge, which made the actors look bad. It has the stupidity and language of a teen sex comedy that misses the mark.Might make it as a low brow rental.Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity. Sex talk."
"This show as different, crazy with big reveals. Well in Season 2 they prove they are out of material. The show moves from one badly contrived episode to another until I couldn't take it anymore. I should have quit 3 episodes before I did. It's as if they had a little success so they brought in professional talent and that professional talent ruined it."
I could not connect to the characters or the story for that matter.  It was boring and I ended up skipping a chunk here and there.  I would not recommend it to anyone.
"I was rather excited when i saw the previews for this show. based on the stephen king short I, which is very good, the show (without any spoilers) is about a town without knowing it that is quarantined under a giant dome.  the story is good and the show had tons of potential until they made it. the actors are relative unknowns, the story jumps and jumps and jumps not creating the most linear storyline to follow. the biggest indicator that this show wasn't good or going to hold my attention is when about 20minutes in I realized despite sitting in front of the screen i had little clue what i was watching what had happened and who the people were.they want you to feel invested in characters you have no back story to, and perhaps that is the trouble with this. Like other shows that thrust you in the action (like lost) Under the Dome doesn't create an engaging or interesting enough reason to keep watching. the wait and see game doesn't work if the watcher has little investment or incentive to wait or see.i started watching the second episode chalking the first ep up to a slow start but midway through gave up.  perhaps others will enjoy it but i did not.... which stinks because I wanted to like this show"
"This started out okay, but became aimless after the middle.  The most attractive character is a murderer who kills his girlfriend's spouse (prior to meeting her).  It's just tedious."
But went wrong somewhere got boring and predictable. Turned into a stereotypical small town bully story. Maybe book better not an S King fan anyway except for 11/23/63
all I did was watch the trailer. It did not sound really all that interesting. Did not add it to my watch list.
"I hope that people enjoy the TV series that did not read the book.  I suspect others who have read the book are gravely disappointed.  Spoilers will appear in this description.  It seems that everyone in town are less than 30 years old other than Big Jim and a few of his cohorts.  The age curve is so skewed that it doesn't allow the sense of town to be depicted.  It feels fake.  In order to believe, you just can't have too many FAKE arguments.  Big Jim's looney son was an excellent demented character in the book but in the TV series he is just a half wit.  Barbie's character in the book was believable.  Again maybe those who did not go read the book first might find his character acceptable but viewed from the books perspective he just doesn't have the true strength of character necessitated for this story.  The red-haired &#34;reporter&#34; walks, walks and walks through her role that really should have been charged full of energy.  The two linked kids finding the egg - too soon, too boring and just too goofy.  Aces for the Book, Jokers for the TV series."
"The first several episodes were engaging, but the whole thing soon descends into cheap, stereotypical behavior and predictable plot twists. Even formulaic plots, which this one is, really can be engaging if they are done with style and imagination. But there's not much style or imagination in evidence here. Paint-by-number stage directions, truly annoying characters. Some of the stuff is just silly and not believable.I am on episode 6, but at this point, I'm not sure I can hack it all the way to the final episode.If I change my mind, I'll change the review.Update:I made it about 15 minutes into episode 8 before I gave up completely. My assessment is that this series is about 10% science fiction and fantasy. The other 90% is standard soap operatics, illustrating over and over and over and over again that spooky inexplicable disasters bring out the absolute worst in human nature. Looting, rioting, raping murdering, having babies at inconvenient times, stealing food and water and medicine, from each other, etc., etc., etc., etc.,And the fantasy? Pretty thin stuff.  Trust me. The premise is kind of klunky to begin with and it doesn't get any better.Unless you like cheesy soap operas and endless illustrations of how desperate times bring out the the absolute worst in people from small New England towns - with the occasional whiff of hokey science fiction - then watch something else."
What? the last is Curtains.  That's not an ending. I kept waiting for another to follow.What a burn.  Very disappointed.  The book was excellent and had an ending .unreal.
"A 2nd rate melodrama - strictly assembly line network stuff - garnished with a third rate sci-fi gimmick. They could have gone into left field and had a lot of fun with this. But they didn't. And neither do we. Too bad, really."
"Ok, it's neat.  But hey where do you go from there?  How about a tunnel?  A tunnel under the dome?  Isn't any show  original anymore?  I guess not, is this from a book?  Or is it from the Simpsons movie?  I bailed at the fire.  The guy gets stuck in the house and 20 minutes later is still yelling for help.  The policewoman can reach him easily so he could have left any time.  The fire doesn't really spread the way it would in real life.  And then what to do when a house is on fire to keep it from spreading?  Knock it down of course letting the air get to it better and sending embers everywhere.  Enough for me.  If they had only had Bart and Homer riding up the dome wall on a motorcycle, I might have been able to hang in there."
"This is an okay series with some interesting scifi elements. It's good enough that it will keep you interested without insulting your intelligence, until E13. Here's why: (could be a spoiler)(1) Big Jim gets the people of Chester's Mill riled about Barbie shooting and murdering people, while Big Jim is the real murderer. So far so good. The key person that BJ tells the town that Barbie shot, who is not dead yet, is Julie Shumway. Of course, Julie Shumway is the only one who can verify that Barbie did not shoot her. Also, both the kid and the nurse helping Julia Shumway observe a distraught Barbie doing what he can so save her.(2) So, Julia Shumway is the key witness that could incriminate BJ, if she recovers from the gunshot wound inflicted by another person besides Barbie. BJ will, for that reason, kill her if she recovers, and this is important. Important because this is what proves BJ is a liar. Julie Shumway was not shot by Barbie because she's alive to say who actually did shoot her-duh?That's it, done deal, Big Jim is a liar anyway he tries to spin it. Both the nurse and the young kid can also verify that Barbie is the one who actually saved Julia's life. So now we have three witnesses that contradict what BJ is saying about Barbie.So in the case you're thinking that BJ could lie his way out of it, I offer this: Barbie shot Julia Shumway and tried to kill her, but at the same time Barbie saves her life, but for some reason Julie Shumway is lying that Barbie didn't shot her. Right. That's believable--by a retard.Intellectually insulting. More importantly, when writers take that much liberty, they need to explain why, and if they do not, it means anything can happen regardless of believability. When that happens, it lowers the IQ of the entire series because it becomes UNBELIEVABLE.The series at this point moves to a purely emotional level and leaves all reason wanting."
This was not a very good show. The performances were generally subpar and the plot was too complex. I did not find any of it compelling.
"I watched this show as an free mindless enjoyment. It was quite frankly okay, until Maxine showed up. All of a sudden she is in charge, with some feeble threats against some real tough guys, that would not even make us weak ones flinch. Her all too well organized rave and fighting fiasco brings in more rowdy men than live under the dome and not only that, they let her keep the loot. It is extremely questionable that a bunch of burly mob, already under stress would let her get away with that. it's more likely they would stampede her to death and afterwards fight among them selves for the loot.Oh, and the voluntary gun give up. Is this Chester' s Mill Hollywood or Chester' s Mill USA. Because in Chester' s Mill USA, hardly anyone I know would give up their guns so easily. In all reality they would not give them up without a fight. That shows us how far Hollywood is removed from reality. This is complete nonsense. Don't get me wrong, I'm a bleeding liberal, I just know my people. As I've seen from living in Los Angeles, the Hollywood liberals are rather fundamentalists with little tolerance for other people's views. Usually in my own quite mind, I call them Liberal Fascists. Believe me, I know people that have had to change their views politically to stay in their carriers and not to be ostracized from the industry.  That is reality not a theory of any kind.Another thing is, that the only people living in this town seem to be the main characters, everyone else seems to be able to leave the Dome and come back at the show director's command. Houses are not much getting broken into and as someone is looting salt from a store, another person is drinking wine on a cozy evening like there is an endless supply. The actors are pretty good and well, kinda save the show, but the directing and production is just awful, one of the worst I've seen. Both the director and the producer should just pack up their stuff, leave Hollywood and go back where they came from.The two stars I give this show are here for the actors. There is nobody else on this show that deserves any stars."
"What happens with such good ideas? This one started with a promising concept and some cool special effects, then quickly (by episode 5) had degenerated into a mess. Unbelievable scenarios, clich&eacute;d events, mediocre acting and disintegrating purpose. Horrible"
"Bunch of people, trapped in a small area by forces they do not understand, limited resources, some people panic, leaders subdue them, some people die, etc... where have we seen this, before? Oh, yeah. On board the Destiny. It's the Destiny, with pick-up trucks and cows.And the residents of Chester's Mill aren't the smartest antelope on the range. Like 47 people stand *watching* a house fire, and HAVE NO IDEA what to DO, until Our Hero shows up and tells them, ""Bring water!"" Oh, ya THINK?Maybe it's a fire thing. Because later, Our Heroine is in the catacombs with CrazyPsycho ('cuz you gotta have one of those), and she has a BIG (cardboard, *flammable*) box of matches. Any THINKING adult would say, ""Hmmmn...we're LOST and need our light to last as long as possible.""You could make at least 5 mini-torches out of that (again, LARGE) matchbox, as well as from (surely) some crap in CrazyPsycho's pack, but nooooo. She burns ALL the matches, lets the last one burn out, and drops the matchbox on the ground.""What do we do now?""I wanted to yell, ""Lay down and DIE, because you're too stupid to go on!""I have a few more episodes on my app; I'll try one more, but if they persist in being doorknobs, I don't think I can take much more.Update 10/02/13: Someone let slip to me what the explanation of The Dome turns out to be. It's actually pretty much the silly thought that first occurred to me during the sequence when the dome comes down. But it was so silly, I dismissed it.NOPE! IT'S PRETTY SILLY! I can't believe they're dragging this out past Season 1. This would have made an interesting mini-series (do they still do those?), but I'm done with this show. I've given up caring WHAT the dome is, WHY it's there, or HOW they'll escape.I just don't care, anymore."
"Let's see..folks are trapped in a dome but the wind still blows, people are ripping off each other's heads, looting stores in one scene and within 5 minutes they're shopping like nothing happened.  The acting...the principle female character who played a nurse in the one season of a much better show: a gifted man is a terrible actress...pretty but a terrible actor.  In short: The plot is dumb and the acting is even worse"
"I really don't think that this show has enough depth of characterization (or enough lead characters) to sustain it longer. The initial mini-series format was fine: important people were killed off and characters reached unrecoverable extremes very quickly because the end was in view. Now there is little left for more plotting: I see the series becoming very stale very soon. The only source of freshness could be in some interaction with what is happening on the outside and the relationship between Barbie and the military. But somehow I don't see that happening. Too many promising characters are now ""sheeple,"" and others too compromised or too inept to continue. It should have ended in a well-plotted two-hour finale instead of the crowd's unbelievable acceptance of Big Jim and what he wants to do. Whatever symbolism the butterfly might have (I thought probability/chaos theory for awhile), it's going to be buried in the dullness of the characters and plotline next season. I doubt if I will watch."
The series started off great but then quickly became dumb.  It's a bummer as this series could have been a great one.  I don't know why dumb series get additional seasons but series like Terra Nova are cancelled.
"The first episodes provided a huge problem/mystery for the characters in the town to deal with, and the writing was character driven and solid, though the (cheesy sci-fi) premise wobbled beneath everything.  It has devolved in the last two episodes into almost unbearable cardboard, with the introduction of Natalie Zea's character (waste of an excellent actor), her mother, the one note female sheriff's deputy, the four kids, horribly underwritten and unevenly played, the underground fight club (yawn).  Won't even watch it for free anymore.  The actor playing 'Barby' can carry a lot of weight on his well-muscled shoulders, but Hercules himself would sink under the weight of this tanking turkey."
"It started great with the idea of people trapped under an invisible dome.  However because the show so far is not giving us any clue of what is happening outside the dome, the story begins to slow down.  It has a lack of a clear protagonist and antagonist characters. We have  crooked town counsel and a few crazy folks but none of this was caused by the dome.  Plus where are the pregnant women, infants and kids? The story has been done so many times that any fan of science fiction can easily predict the winners and losers. Now if there were some strange creatures coming out and in of the dome, then we would have a quicker moving story line due to the fear factor.  I am sure with King, that the novel is much better than this TV script!"
"But the characters are not well developed and have almost no identification to the book that Mr King wrote so aptly. Very disappointed in this mini-series so far. The only thing I can say is that I will watch it through to the end, since I'm a prime member, and I know there IS an ending.... but I hope if the Great Movie Producer in the sky ever gets the bright idea to do another King novel.... that someone actually reads the book. And has an imagination."
"the dome concept captivates me but the characters do not.  I find myself watching this show and disliking it yet unable to look away.  The only half way likeable charactersfor me so far are Barbie and the boy math whiz.  The story is definitely going to have to accelerate with some drama or at least reveal some things because right now, if all Chester's Mill perished I wouldn't be that moved."
"If you read the book, nothing else needs to be said. This is a comic book in comparison. Really an insult to the fan of King. Let's pray they don't try to do 11-22-63 in this venue."
"Silly show, might like it if I were 14 years old. Regular television is boring, cable shows are violent and sick."
It could have been an exciting sci-fi thriller instead its been turned in to a drawn out badly written soap.
Started out strong but has started to wander around aimlessly.  They should have made it a miniseries instead of a full season show.  I hope they don't go to a second season.  They're losing focus.  I'm not sure I'll continue watching this season.  Will not watch a second season
If I were to state clearly why I do not like the series I would start a fire storm and get a bunch of hate responses.My perception is that the series is being used in part to advance an agenda that is offensive to an awful lot of folks. It would not detract from the plot at all for it not to have been included.
"There's a lot of room for an interesting show here, but they've spoiled it by introducing a ridiculous amount of crime in the small town that has inexplicably been covered by a dome.  In the first two episodes (all I watched), the dome issue itself is merely background for murder and kidnapping and a few gross images of the dome cutting a cow and other living things in half."
"I caught this after the first season and watched it from start to finish.  How many ways can to do a story about a dome? It seems the writers got tired and just started making s*** up.  Example?  the entire series they said Barbie was the 'Monarch'  The butterfly flies around him twenty minutes and everyone says he is the one...THEN??? It flys over to his girlfriend and now out of the blue it was her all along???  Give me a break... Soooo stupid.  Then the character shifts at one minutes characters are good then they in the next episode are bad then good again.  Sometimes in the same episode!  I find this tiring and simply manipulative.  Make your people good or evil and stick to your story line! It seems they have a bunch of twenty somethings doing the writing and they cannot hold a thought for more than ten seconds.  In conclusion sloppy writing, tedious dragged out plot, and after thirteen episodes we still do nto know why the dome came or what it is for."
"It was bad enough to not follow the book, but to continue the story next season. Give me a break. I will not be watching the made up sequel to this mess of a show"
Incredibly weak! This is successful network tv now? I m afraid quality in future tv shows will be horrible for a long time and only cable and new broadcasters like amazon or netflix will provide good content.....
"weak, boring completely flawed characters. As much as I was drawn into the first episode's plot and as much as I wanted to love this show with all the mystery surrounding  the murders and the excitement I just couldn't enjoy it as much because the characters didn't really grab me and as time went by I became less and less interested in the plot to begin with.Danny is a teenage boy who's back in town, the only difference is he spent the last couple of years in jail for murdering none other but his aunt who was baby setting him and his two childhood friends Joe and Lacey one afternoon. Now, Danny claims he's not a psychopath or a sociopath nor did he murder his aunt by accident, he did it on purpose fully knowing the consequences *something involving a necklace?* but he refuses to tell anyone the real reason behind it which not only sounds odd and strange it also makes me question the sanity of Danny's character granted he was 9 at the time so what could he possibly know about his aunt to make such a decision. His mother extremely good looking and glamorous compared to the rest of the mothers on the show, is not only a source of envy and despise she's also insisting on making the rest of the town accept her criminal son at all costs including flirting with the local High school's principle and attending public ceremonies. Joe is torn between being loyal to her murderer ex, childhood friend and the fact that oh well he is a murderer who put them through a traumatic experience considering he committed the murder while they were on scene. Lacy though nostalgic for the past is convincing herself and others that she's totally against him and unwilling to accept him as a friend. Not long after Danny's return another murder happens this time Lacy's best friend Regina who's the popular/air head pretty mediocre girl in school is the victim. Now of course everyone blames Danny considering his obvious dark past and Joe's father is working very hard to find an evidence that'll link him to the murder and put him in jail this time forever if necessary. Meanwhile, we don't know who the real murderer is.Yes, the plot is interesting for a mystery drama but after a while it just seems so contrived and dragged on. It also seems very unbelievable at times. Danny is your golden child knows everything, straight A student, a pro at playing soccer for god's sake after spending years in jail? You really want me to believe that he doesn't find it hard at all to fit right back into society. He's so at ease with other people and with the public community that it's like he never left. Now in reality most criminals will find some difficulty in dealing with the real world after being locked up for so long. Lacy as a character is completely torn she doesn't know if she wants to be Danny's friend or his enemy. She's the classic know it all girl in High school that you just wanted to strangle at times. So perfect, so elegant. Boring! Joe is the only one who stands out from the crowd by trying to actually look at the bigger picture instead of hating on Danny like everyone else and blaming him for every murder there is in town wether he did it or not, except she too has her doubts and is confused at times. She stands up for her childhood friend for reasons unknown *I smell a romance anyone?* Danny's mother is conniving and overly ambitious trying to climb the social ladder, your average desperate housewife, the socialist, rich woman. The rest of the characters are two dimensional and very stereotypical as well. The jerks in school who are popular and exude over confidence that borders into arrogance, the fake blonds, the hateful towns people who are so narrow minded and empty headed they believe anything the news would tell them as truth. I just couldn't stand half of the characters.Yeah, give it a try. The show has it's redeeming qualities I'll only continue watching because I want to know who the murderer is and why Danny killed his aunt. I don't even watch a full episode anymore I just fast forward it cause I get bored easily with the unnecessary details.EDIT: *SPOILER ALERT* :;So I just continued watching further episodes to see if it'll improve and now it appears to be that Lacy has a crush on Danny. So Joe and Lacy are both fighting for Danny's affections. A very unlikable character who's a snob, and a very likely turn of events. Makes the show even stupider than it was."
"This totally lacks the fun of the first movie. The second movie really strained the concept and was also not as good as the first, but it was much better than this one. It has some great cameos but they are very poorly done. If you love the Hatchet movies, watch it, but don't expect much. They need to either find their original creative and fun spark, or STOP, PLEASE!"
"Something was missing with this one. It just seemed less fun. There was alot of off island action where 3 of the main characters were searching for the mcguffin, in this case Crowley's Father's ashes, and while it was a nice change of scenery, the movie also got away from the action and slowed immensely. I also found the character of Amanda to be annoying, she seemed like the Scrappy Doo of the movie. That being said, the kills were inventive and fun as usually. And there were some funny moments. Basically newcomers to the series, should stay away and just watch the first two films instead. But, if your a fan, give it watch, it ain't all bad. And I'll happily watch # 4, if they make one"
"NO SPOILERS:Had no intention of offering up a review and recently cleared some stored episodes from my DVR (despite having 800-hours of capacity).  Then I saw the large number of 5* reviews and the doubt crept in!  Could I have missed something here?  Do I need the rest of the year off from submitting reviews?  Did I, during the few episodes that I watched, focus too much attention on scenes where RR was changing in front of her partner and as a result missed the multi-layered plot complexity?  NOT!The dialog seems forced, the plots are not overly interesting and the only thing to keep me vested is the hope that Maxwell, after a particularly vexing case, shows up @ King's with a bottle of Cloudy Bay, a meatball pizza and massage oil, asking if he would like to practice ""jousting""!Metacritic's gave the show a rating of 56, which may be a tad generous.  There is nothing offensive about King & Maxwell, so if you are suffering from insomnia and C-Span is not in the midst of an open debate on naming the State bird of Delaware, go for it!"
she has to go.  need a more dyaminc character to work.  She just doesn't have the &#34;it&#34; factor.  Show will more then likely be cancelled because of her.
i wasn't sure what to think of this. was it a parody? am i to take it seriously? it played like a 3am &#34;you can become a millionaire in real estate with no money down&#34;. look at my really over priced watch. i only had to serve 15 yrs in a violent prison for it. winning?
"How to consider the suppositions of such disdain within society? Dare I 'think outside the box?' Must I disavow who I am? Were I to agree with all the philosophical and psychological aspects of this presentation, would I still be creative? Perhaps the most annoying facet is the assumption that they have the only correct answers! The format is poorly conceived and presented. In all honesty, the supercilious attitude of those involved in the theorizing is enough to cause a negative response even if one might agree in part. Recommended? Only for those who might have an interest in the cause of the inability of 'great thinkers' to offer reasonable conclusions and those with an interest in aberrant psychoanalysis!"
"Well, it would have been pretty o.k., but why the propaganda at the end? Please! We are not stupid. I happened to be born in a socialist country, grew up and went to schools there. Why do you think I live in the USA for the past 30 years? Because it is better here.I can't really call this a documentary. To me documentaries states and examines the facts, and the makers leave their opinions out, so WE, the viewers can make up our own mind."
"Maniac (Franck Khalfoun, 2012)I have long been antipathetic to the work of Alexandre Aja; Haute Tension, his first film to get wide American releases, is an overrated, boring thriller with plot holes large enough for the nuclear mutants in his horrific The Hills Have Eyes remake to drag tourists through. Franck Khalfoun is Alexandre Aja (and Aja's partner Gregory Lavasseur)'s protege, and there are times when I think the servant is easily going to overshadow the master; 2007's P2 is an amusing if forgettable piece of fluff, but it's a hundred times better than any Aja-helmed film I've seen to date. Which gives you an idea of where I'm coming from when I saw Maniac start showing up on a number of Best of 2013 lists, including topping Dread Central's Best Horror Movies of the Year consensus. And, from my perspective, I was right; this isn't even as good as P2, though once again it's acres better than much of Aja's own offerings (Aja and Levasseur, as with P2, wrote the script and passed it off to Khalfoun).Plot: Frank (Elijah Wood, once again trying to shed the lingering spectre of Frodo Baggins) is a mannequin restorer who has a thing for women's hair&#8212;especially when he's skinned it from their heads, scalp intact, and puts it on his mannequins. Yeah, he's got a few issues, examined in enough detail to be really creepy in flashbacks featuring Frank as a young boy (Eli Dupont in his first screen appearance) watching his mother (America Olivo from the recent remake of Friday the 13th), presumably a prostitute, plying her trade. (The whole psychology-of-the-killer thing here, as is often the case, is somewhat shockingly reactionary, pop psychology 101 without doing anything new or interesting, and it just feels tiresome.) Things get slightly more interesting when a lovely young artist named Anna (Safe House's Nora Arnezeder) notices some of Frank's creations in the window and asks if she could commission some of them for one of her upcoming shows. Frank has, shall we say, always had problems connecting with women on a human level (thus his mannequin obsession&#8212;though that is not to say they don't talk back); perhaps Anna will be the one to break through?Even if you've never seen the original&#8212;and I have started watching it maybe half a dozen times over the years and never made it past the twenty-minute mark&#8212;if you've seen a half-dozen slasher films at all, you know exactly where this is going, don't you? You should. The original film may have broken some sort of mold as far as the psychology of the killer blah blah blah (though I would call that highly arguable; this ground had been well-trod by giallo long before 1980), but even if you buy into that argument, the idea of a remake of it in 2012 is, well, pretty senseless. The saving graces here are the two principals (for most of the film, at least); Wood plays his role to the hilt, and Arnezeder comes off with the perfect blend of innocence and sexiness-in-passing to really put the chemical screws to Frank. Problem is, the script tears all that up and forces these square pegs into hexagonal holes in the last ten minutes-ish of the movie, because that is what plot demands. (And just forget about the last sequence. Turn the movie off about five minutes before the end and you'll have a better time with it than I did.) But still, those first eighty minutes are kind of good, if you think of them as a dramatic reading rather than a fully-formed movie. **"
"The reason I ever liked this show was for the mystery about whether or not the main character was actually insane. I didn't need it to be answered, but I feel like this show is at its best when it spends its episodes asking that question, and investigating the mystery. Sadly, most of the episodes of this show, this season included, are about what a dog is thinking when it does dog-like things, combined with Wilfred continually messing up Ryan's life. I'm just not interested in that."
Moronic idea for a series.  How they were able to get anyone to pay for such a series is beyond me.
"If you like to watch drunks talk and swill booze, this is the show for you. For myself: not so much"
Little reason to waste time on this bit of supposed comedy with all of the participants drunk at the time of their performances. Just a reminder of how unpleasant and boring drunks can be.
"It's a cool idea, but it just seems too fake and I'd rather just watch an actual documentary about the history than this silly version. There were a couple of slightly funny parts."
"Too complicated, too unbelievable (who really believes Jane would choose Owen over Grayson?), Stacy has gone from ditz to doctor of emotions, Margaret Cho, such a great sidekick, has been reduced to running errands. Kim has lost her edge for motherhood.  Grayson seems more silly than ever.  Where did the real ""Drop Dead Diva"" go?  Addendum:  Just watched ""Missed Congeniality"" and barely got through it.  Case premises were ridiculous, resolutions even more far-fetched, not even qualifying as fable,just silly.  The show does not know when to strategically use the Grayson-Jane dynamic and continues to place ""interruptions"" to their progress only exhausting the viewer and leaving them wanting.  Each episode is devolving.  I am only watching to see how bad it can get!"
This is a silly movie featurette. These girls must have had a good time being paid for little acting and mostly skin exposure.
"Reverb starts well.  The characters and situation are interesting.  The initial scare scenes are well done.  But then there are a few contrived story plot points.  (SPOILER AHEAD) Obviously, these are done to get more people involved for the later slasher scenes. If the director had shot a few more scenes depicting how the killer descends into madness, it would have added more believability.From that point forward, the plot unravels.  From my point of view, the scenes are disconnected and thrown together."
"I have watched this  show through all three series', and the first was really good,..I mean really good!Then  into the second it started to be more about family bulls*** and less about the show,.. the two main characters areabsolutely great,  really good enough to keep you  yearning for more. Both their personalities are perfect individually and when intertwined a perfect  duo.But when that Cowardly lion looking, big mouth cow of a mother comes into the picture, it absolutely ruins the show. She is a fat cow and her character could have easily been left out to improve the show.  Tommy's character enters the show with good intent. Her youngest brother plays a goof ball sissy and they picked a perfect  actor for his part.The story of the Mob father and and her finally finding her real mother is really cool.  But is has become a stupid Dramedy instead of a good Detective program.Really sad,... a perfect example of what has happened to Good Television shows in this and the last decade.I have started watching City Homicide on Hulu, which is an Australian series that started in '07 and it is the show this one should have been and ten times more.As I have bought the Amazon season pass for this show,.. I have finally decided it is not worth the money ,...and believe me, the crap Amazon puts out there about , ""Cancel at any time"".. That is bigger bulls*** than the show itself.Don't waste your time !"
Was really looking forward too another show that could fulfill my dream of being as good as the wire. Sadly this doesn't. While there is lots of action and the grenade that was thrown from a foot ball field was cool I thought there was way too much emphasis on the cats that shoot spiderwebs. Well nice try but just not the wire-worthy
Not that great of film I expected a good love story but none there.  Don't waste your money.could of been better.
"Not really what I expected.  Kind of plodding and predictable.  The acting seemed very scripted and wooden.  I wanted to be drawn in more to the plot however it played into the stereotypical unhappy wife, boring husband, glamorous boyfriend with secretive controlling abuse issues and fearful ex-girlfriend.  More like a Lifetime movie for me."
I really don't think this was some of his best work. I am more of a Madea lover. Would rather laugh than be confused
I saw the 4 star rating. story was good but the acting from the main character was terrible.I really wanted to like this movie but could not tolerate affected acting.
"After watching this season, I went brain dead and didn't realize how bad this season was till I bought Season 14 out of boredom and of course got hooked into another season.  Made me realize how bad and lame Season 15 was. Season 14 rocked, absolute ruthless gameplay the way the show should be.  No Showmances and idiots.  Wish I could get a Season 15 refund.  Watch BB14 for some classic drama the way it's always been in BB."
"I thought that the idea of this movie was good, however the execution of this movie was really disappointing.  There was a whole lot of something and something and then some more something that lead to a whole lot of nothing.  The best part of this movie is the trailer once you've seen that you have seen enough."
"IT looked alright at first,I mean they land on A moon for what ever reason,and when they get there things start to happen.People die for one thing they may of found life if you can believe that.I'm sorry but in my view it could of been done better."
"This movie could have been great. Should have been with an exciting concept, but with all the down right absurd events and idiotic things people do just to move a plot to its intended destination, all with complete disregard for character development or common sense, ruined the whole thing. Example: people go out to repair ship with out being tethered to anything but each other, with expected results, fluid used in ship circuits (or something not sure where exactly) will poison the entire ship and kill everyone without a mechanism to decontaminate or clean spacesuits, people have to gather samples by hand, no robots I guess, people go out on their own and run off by themselves doing whatever the they want to on obviously unstable ice. No one is leading this mess, no commander. It's entirely rediculous, the whole thing. None of these crew members were professional, com pentane or effective. They were immature and stupid. This seemed more like a mix of Big Brother and Blair Witch, neither of which I care for. The only this I liked was the good environmental visuals."
"This is one of those ""footage"" movies.  There are so many of them you know what to expect; jumping back and forth through the story for no apparent reason except to make the movie not drag on and be completely boring in the middle.  Unfortunately, all of this movie is boring.  Bunch of people die, they were too lazy to actually film the deaths so they either drift off into space, drown in a lake, who cares they're dull and lifeless characters anyway you won't care.My europan light parasitic space octopus doesn't approve."
"The film immediately reminds one of &#34;2001: A Space Odyssey.&#34; A crew of people head out to one of Jupiter's moon to search for life and communications is lost giving a new meaning to the phrase &#34;The Jupiter Effect.&#34; Like &#34;2001&#34; the film doesn't spend a lot of time building character, but admittedly this production does a better job, but then what film didn't. In &#34;2001&#34; the sell was special effects. The crew of this feature are the best no accent English speaking white/Asian scientists and engineers from around the globe.Science fiction wise, the movie addresses some of the issues of a Europa mission such as the deadly radiation that comes from Jupiter. Radiation destroys cell structure making the existence of large complex organisms questionable. People are sent to Europa because an &#34;unmanned probe wasn't going to do it.&#34; Personally I would have sent maybe one or two just to be sure.The movie utilizes camera logs and installed video cameras on board to give the film a modern hand held low budget &#34;Paranormal&#34; feel to it. Indeed, like so many films in this genre, one must wait for nearly the last scene to see a glimpse of &#34;it.&#34; For me the introduction of multiple installed cameras as a substitute for a film cheapened the production.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."
"Shot in a kind of found-footage documentary style, EUROPA REPORT is a sci-fi movie about a group of six astronauts chosen by a private organization to travel to Jupiter&#8217;s moon, Europa, to investigate the possibility of life. As part of the journey, the crew is extensively taped and photograph: there are cameras everywhere on the ship, including some in the helmets of their spacesuits. The cameras and communications keep sending footage back to Earth on a constant basis. Thus the EUROPA REPORT is a documentary consisting of footage of the astronauts on their journey as well as spliced interviews before and after the trip.I didn&#8217;t have any issue with the overall plot of the movie. There are several moments where you had to really suspend your disbelief (I mean, why was there no plan in place if a person&#8217;s spacesuit became contaminated? And, don&#8217;t these people know how to follow orders: when you&#8217;re ordered to come back to the ship after a walk, you come back). However, there are moments like these in most of the movies we watch; the suspension of disbelief is part of what makes a movie a movie.I also thought the acting was pretty good and for such a low budget film the special effects were well done, too. Lastly, I appreciated how much the movie tried to ground itself in realism.However, despite an interesting plot, good acting, and decent special effects, I found the EUROPA REPORT to be incredible boring. I thought about stopping the movie after just fifteen minutes into it. Part of this is because the way the movie is edited. The first half of the movie is all choppy: it jumps around from all kinds of different footage on the ship from different time periods and includes interviews with the astronauts before leaving as well as interviews with the leaders of the corporation that sent them after the mission ended. During the first half of the movie there is no real structure or continuity. It&#8217;s difficult to figure out exactly what&#8217;s happening and what has already happened. There are moments that I even thought were dream images (this misconception was fixed towards the end of the movie).Beyond that, the other reason EUROPA REPORT is so boring is because nothing really happens. Much of the footage of the astronauts is just images of them walking around or talking. That&#8217;s it. About halfway through the movie things pick up when something unexpected happens (something that was foreshadowed much earlier). However, then it slows down again. There&#8217;s a build up when the craft approaches Eurpoa, but even after arriving on Europa, the movie never really picks up. I realize the story grounds itself in realism and tries to provide a more accurate view of what space exploration is like. However, in general, everyday life doesn&#8217;t make a good movie, even everyday life aboard a space ship travel half-way across the solar system.Overall, although there is some decent acting, good special effects, and a solid story that tries to immerse itself in realism, EUROPA REPORT is like a bunch of cheap fireworks purchased just before Independence Day: a slow burn that ends in a fizzle instead of a bang."
"The movie is about a mission to Europa to discover what is under the ice. The movie was more drama than scientific and overall pretty bland. The music kind of ruined it as well. Overall, it might be a watch once kind of movie."
"God damn this was just horrible.The story line is boring beyond belief.Agata Buzek was f... horrible, don't they have better looking and English speaking actresses in Poland. What the f... was that?Who was the person doing the casting for this less then mediocre film?Statham better start choosing his roles wisely, otherwise he will ruin his reputation. Just stick to action, Jason.The same thing goes for actors like Colin Farrell or Jud Law.I just hope his next flick, &#34;Homefront&#34; will be the next big thing."
"As a Jason Statham fan I was disappointed with Redemption.  The plotline was weird along with the unbelievable character Statham played in the film. His character is an ex-Afghanistan vet bedeviled by PTSD, who becomes almost homicidal when sober and helpless when drunk.  He has sex with a nun, who is also a hard to conceive character. Looks to me that the movie was just cranked out to make a few dollars."
Long and drawn out! Worst Jason Statham movie to date. Just didn't seem to go anywhere. One of those movies  you keep watching hoping something is going to happen...It doesn't
"On camera evidence reviews were not sufficient enough to make a conclusion. It is just like, &#34;This thing showed there and another thing showed on that spot; so this place must be haunted.&#34; kind of analysis."
TOO MUCH CURSING AND PUT DOWN OF CHARACTERS.
"It sounded good, but it was not for me.  It had the staple characters for a romantic comedy; the idiot male friend, the disapproving and embarrassing parents.  I did not find the characters endearing, just annoying.  And I simply did not care how it would end.  Let's put it this way, if I had no paid for it, I would have turned it off.  I didn't hate it, I just did not find it engaging or original.  Not my cup of tea."
"&#34;If you can make it through the first year of marriage you can make it through anything.&#34; Nat (Byrne) and Josh (Spall) have known each other for 7 months when they decide to get married. What starts off happy and exciting quickly turns into something neither of them are sure it will last. When Josh's ex comes back into the picture and Nat's client arrives their relationship is tested to the breaking point with neither Nat or Josh wanting to give up. Judging by the preview I was expecting a laugh out loud comedy and I was looking forward to this. Stephen Merchant and Minnie Driver are really the best and funniest parts of this movie. Their dialog and timing are great. As for the main characters and main story line I found myself more disgusted then I found myself laughing. Nat and Josh really aren't likable and as far as Guy went I really hated him. This movie is nothing more then two married people bordering on cheating on each other with people who are willing even though all parties involved know the situation. If you have seen the movie Closer then you have seen a better version of this. There were funny parts in this but really the movie just made me more upset then anything. Overall, Stephen Merchant and Minnie Driver are great, the rest of the movie not so much. I give it a C+."
IMHO...Good thing this show is ending. Everything so far this season just seems cartoonish and manipulative story-wise. It's like the writers ran out of the good stuff so now there just throwing everything in there to run out the clock. Last two seasons were a lot better. This year the show's isn't grounded or compelling. I think people are watching just to see what wacky improbable plot point is going to pop out and shock us next. And really...did they have to revisit the ricin cigarette yet again? Enough with that nonsense!
"I just couldn't get into this show. Being a Latina living close to the Mexico/US  border the problem of the desaparecidas is very real to me and this show just hits too close to home. I know that there are many shows out there that are based on nonfictional cases but I am just too close to this one. The female detective does not interest me enough and because of my emotional connection to the victims and to the Mexican detectives work problems that I just can't care about her issues (even though I appreciate a lead with Aspergers). I hope other people watch the show and that it inspires them to educate themselves about the real and very serious issues facing women (and men) in Juarez, the desaparecidas."
"Based on the other reviews I read, I expected something as intriguing as 'The Killing'.  The female lead in this show is annoying and distracting.  What a disappointment.  If you want a good show, don't waste your time with this one."
"I know, I know..... I only managed to watch 5 minutes and so I probably shouldn't be allowed to comment.  But in that first five minutes, so many things were off that I had to stop.  Let's see:1) The guy driving on the bridge and looking at his watch.  Really? A watch? Who's wearing a watch? What about a smartphone or maybe just the time on the dashboard?2) Someone manages to shut down and then turn back on all the power on both sides of the border.  Really? Come on man.3) First really bad line of the show ""Shut down the border!"".4) Some guy smokes a cig, puts it out and takes the butt.  Then walks away.  Obviously we're meant to be like ""oh remember that guy"" but really it feels like they're banging us over the head with it.5) The detective woman is wearing her iPhone earbuds while she walks over the crime scene. Really? If the writers want to give us the notion that she's all like ""Whatever.. blah blah"" then at least spend a few minutes building that rather than trying to convince us with some iPhone earbuds. Really, do detectives show up to a middle of the night call listening to their iPod?6) Of course she's inhospitable to the detective on the other side of the border.7) Very, very oddly enough there's an ambulance coming FROM Mexico over to the USA. I suppose its possible but does that happen??  Also, her husband is theoretically dying in the ambulance and the detective is like ""oh well, he can just die because you can't cross"" when clearly the ambulance would be let through.8) The wife tries to hand some hundreds to the police detective to let her through.  I know that works in a lot of places around the world, but any normal person would know you can't just hand over money to the police.That's only five minutes!!!!!  Oh well, I guess I'm out $1.99 for the pilot.  I'll go watch Luther Season 3."
"I started watching it because it sounded like a good idea, but had to stop watching half way through the first episode. The story lacks that grip factor, it is boring. The poor acting makes it that much harder to watch. I felt this story was going to drag out all season without giving any answers and couldn't spend my time and money on it."
"This film features a woman who's pregnant that smokes and drinks.  What's the worst that could happen?  Well, perhaps just renting this misfire; that might be bad enough.I've never been a fan of the show ""Reno 911!"" so it's probably not much of a surprise that this movie didn't quite work for me, although I have been a fan of some of Rob Corddry films.  Sure, ""Hell Baby"" has a few laughs.  And it is an interesting idea, taking movies such as ""The Exorcist,"" ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""The Omen,"" and perhaps maybe even ""Chucky"" and ""Species"" and making fun of them a bit while being simultaneously affectionate towards them.I did like the idea that they twisted the female lead here a bit.  In ""The Omen"" and ""Rosemary's Baby,"" everyone either thought that the female lead was crazy, or at least tried to make her think that she was.  Here, the female lead pretty much is crazy and she knows it.  She might even embrace it herself.But this film relies way too much on cheap sight gags, ""tricks"" that grew really, really, really old in movies made by people such as Mike Myers from Saturday Night Live.  Some of those Austin Powers flicks, for example, were cute at first.  But it didn't take long before the sight gags did little more than make you just roll your eyes.  And my eyes began rolling here before the halfway point for sure.I think that this film had a chance to be funny, but it just didn't quite work for me.  Therefore, I'll just have to say ""Hell No!"" on a recommendation -- rather make that a pass -- on ""Hell Baby."""
"Don't waste your time! I thought this would be good, unfortunately it was not! I can't even say it was worth my time to watch it, the story was lame and the acting wasn't any better. :-("
"So I'll admit that I've seen a lot worse, which is why I'm giving it a 2 instead of a 1. However, the effort the filmmaker made to tastefully satirize the horror genre was WEAK. My suggestion is that you do not waste your time on this unpleasantly cheesy, poor excuse for a spoof. It's not even something you'd find entertaining when drunk."
"Don't be fooled by the hype in the trailer preview it looked great so I rented it thinking oh boy this is going to be a great film. Couple buys a house in a nice neighborhood, first day there nice but weird neighborhood guy keeps poping up climbing in the window etc, he is funny though, The husband seems oblivious to reality at times. The wife is pregnant, weird creepy things start happening it becomes scary. 2 Priests come to do an exorcism, she goes into labor has the baby but in reality there were 2 fetuses 1 a horrifying devil with horns etc, the other human Why I say moronic is when the baby devil bites the guys neck though having time to he doesn't do anything right away when a normal person given the chance would grab it by the throat trying to hold it away from them plus the priest could get it with the holy water etc I would. People are made to look stupid in parts of this movie which to me detracts from what could have been an awesome movie if the idiotic stuff had been cut out.I must admit some of it was comical from the stupidity. The actors are great liked them"
"The movie was not worth watching, and I paid for it. It was to far out there, story line silly."
"And so here we are in the sixth episode of the season and each week it has become more and more difficult to watch. It is the same old tired thing. Kody's confused, Mari is indecisive, Robyn is clueless, Janelle feels lost and Kristine is floating out there. This episode was painful to watch. It is obvious from those of us watching that Mari does not want to have another child but is too much of a coward to come out and say it. We keep hearing about how money is so important to them, but each wife has moved into a McMansion. Kody continues to be useless except to knock people up. Although, if the wives want to start a business, they might want to think of Kody hair care products. I keep waiting for Kristine or Janelle to say ""I'm outta here."" The kids are coming across as complete brats. To top it off we got the creep factor of having to hear about Robyn's 'first time."" Can we say too much information!! If Kody and his wives relationships are sooooo bad, may I suggest they stop doing this show and start focusing back on themselves. Will be canceling the rest of my paying season!"
"I really enjoyed the previous seasons but season 6 isn't very good. The only focus are the homes and the wives crying/fighting as to why the can't get into them before Christma(at least these first 5 episodes). The last few episodes in particular which focused on Mary and her daughter being pissy were awful! They came across as so ungrateful for how far they had gotten, it was a bit absurd especially considering it was Christmas time and focus should have been being thankful. I think they need to focus more on the dynamics w/ the older kids more as they bloom into adults and give us more insight into their church lives and their faith. I just get this feeling that this show has run its course for now. I do question if Robyn is preggo- based on her appearance and that she is sick a lot in this season-hmmm...."
"The first episode of Heat of the Sun was enjoyable but then it became evident that the show portrays people in the past with modern norms and morals.  Even in Africa, away from jolly old England during the time portrayed, it would have been rare to find people as portrayed so often in this show.  From the comments, it seems there are several people who still like it, but most people who search for these kind of shows do so to experience something different than modern show."
"Here we have your standard creature feature with nearly every cliched element represented. You've got a group of cocky youngsters in a lake where there's no cell phone reception. You've got a curious mismatch of personalities, from the creepy loner to the blonde tease to the nerdy filmmaker wannabe and (of course) the alpha male joke. I mean, jock. You've even got a wizened old man who warns them about impending danger (they ignore the old fart, natch). Watch as they take a row boat into the middle of a lake and begin getting picked off, one by one, by some kind of giant, carnivorous fish.Let's start with the only thing that works. I almost gave this movie one star but I decided not to solely because of the performances. These kids aren't portraying any group of seniors you'd ever want to know in real life, but at least they threw themselves into their roles wholeheartedly. The majority of them did pretty decent jobs, so kudos to the cast. It's too bad that the writing and directing were so completely inept that it turned the acting into frosting on a turd cake.This is not to say the characters were any good. You've got Johnny, the morose moron who actually knew about the fish and didn't try to stop his so-called friends as they gadded about in the water. He spends 90% of his screen time sulking, scowling, and pouting for no real reason. It looked for all the world like they cast him just to give the film a poor man's replica of another Johnny -- Depp. Watch him emote! And demonstrate a total lack of responsibility or skill! There's the nebbish Zeke, who spends the bulk of the film either pitying or glorifying himself. There's three other people, including that blonde who is just plain enough to flirt shamelessly with everyone. The end result: they're all horrible jerks.I blame the script. The film is trying to make a point, believe it or not, about how loyalties and friendship can be strained when death is on the line, but it makes the point in a bumbling and repetitive way. Plus, given that every single one of these people is despicable and annoying, there's absolutely no ""will-they-won't-they"" tension to the story. In fact, roughly forty minutes into the film I found my allegiances changing over to the fish. ""Hurry up, fish,"" I thought. ""What are you waiting for?"" Instead of providing some kind of sympathetic figure to give the tale forward momentum, you've got people yelling and crying and endangering each others' lives for no reason other than because it's dramatic. Or supposed to be.Speaking of forward momentum, let's talk about how it takes five healthy kids something like ten hours to paddle a boat approximately two to three hundred yards to shore. The film wants you to feel like they're trapped in the middle of this lake (the fish quickly dispatches of their oars, but only because they idiotically use them to jab at the thing whenever it gets near), but it seems highly unlikely, since we are shown that the stuff they throw out of the boat (junk food, etc.) washes up on the shore hours before the end of the film. Even if you accept that the boat is somehow in a dead zone, they come up with the bright idea to vote people off the boat to distract the fish so that they can then paddle with their hands to the shore. The first time they do this, it buys them a paltry thirty seconds of time. But they keep doing it, over and over, and -- what a shock -- it never gets them anywhere.With a concept like this, viewers will be astonished less by the B-grade effects of the fish (when it's underwater, it seems pretty well done, but it surfaces enough times for you to sense that it's a glorified balloon) or by the violent turns these friends make, and more by how everything is essentially the result of stupid people being stupid. That's only good cinema if you're making a comedy. Sometimes B-grade horrors like this can be so bad they're funny, but such is not the case here. The film is a joke, for certain, but it takes itself so seriously that it inspires less friendly enjoyment and more irritated head shakes. If they remade it from the fish's point of view, it would probably be silly enough to be good times, but as it is, it's nothing but fairly talented young actors pouring their hearts out for weak, watery schlock."
"To tell the truth this movie was pretty predictable and none of the characters were really very likable. The effects (mainly creature) were pretty lame and to be hones I didn't really expect much better than that. The movie did have one good point I will admit. If you're a psych major or even just interested in psychology then this movie is worth a look. This movie is an interesting picture of human behavior in a survival situation and not for the best! Other than academic interest I can't really recommend this movie, there are others out there that are much better so save your money."
"I have not enjoyed this season as much as the previous seasons.  As a a matter of fact, I am extremely disappointed and can't wait until it is over.  Why did they kill Teo?  There is no rhyme or reason to the story."
I don't like her rebelling against Augie. For me Augie made the show and her responses to him and when she worked with him were great.

When his brother murders a 14 year old prostitute a hired hit-man is brought in to kill him. Julian's mother (Thomas) shows up to get her son's body and to get Julian to extract revenge in the name of his brother. I have seen Drive and I did like it but it was different and very slow. This is the same writer and director of that movie and the style and feel are almost identical. For those that haven't seen Drive, this movie is very slow moving and deliberate with the dialog. By that I mean that every word has a point and seems important. Also much like drive this review has more words then are spoken in the entire movie. I know I keep comparing this to Drive but that is really all I have to say about it. Same feel and writing, but to me it wasn't as good. Overall, if you really liked Drive you will like this one as well. I give it a C+."
"Grabbers is just a little too goofy to work as an exciting monster movie.  The effects are also too low-fi.  The CGI looks dated, and there's a scene with a prosthetic severed head that basically looks like a painted mannequin head.  For a film about a murderous alien squid, Grabbers fails at the grisly details necessary to be successful."
"I could only understand maybe 1% of what they were saying.However, this film seems truly dedicated to recapturing the one and only brilliant plots of 1950's IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE themes.Watch it!I recommend it, even though I have no FREAKING idea what they were saying...."
"Something is killing the people on A small island,and it turns out to be some kind of sea monster that looks like A octopus.Like I said could've been better."
"I purchased this show because I thought it would be like the hallmark specials. The first one was, but they started to get surreal by the third one. The acting for the male lead is feminine in nature. The discussions and &#34;drama&#34; within the show are petty. Therefore I couldn't get past the 4th show. (even though I purchased the entire 1st season)."
"I have always enjoyed Hallmark specials with authentic story lines, in-depth and subtle acting, beautiful cinematography, some story arc with, like life, uncertain conclusions (Think ""Sarah, Plain and Tall."")  This story, however, was predetermined with the first glance at Andie MacDowell.  The quirks of Cedar Grove and the people who live there are highly unbelievable with ""conflicts"" that sort themselves out far too perfectly.  This is a saccharin, no investment from the viewer pilot, a feel good wisp that is so light it's like eating whipped cream with too much air, too much sweet and not enough flavor.  A spoiled tradition from Hallmark."
I was un-happy about the movie that I ended it early on. I like moore action films then this movie.
"Horror fans will likely recognize Joe Swanberg as the nerve-grating older brother that was shot in the back with an arrow in ""You're Next"" and probably remember the disturbing short he directed for ""V/H/S"" involving Emily, the bump on her arm, and aliens. ""Drinking Buddies"" is a more lighthearted but genuine side of the multi-talented (actor, director, writer, producer, and often cinematographer) Swanberg. The comedy is noteworthy for being completely improvised and having no script. While the film's spontaneity is admirable, the awkward structure of ""Drinking Buddies"" restrains it from making much of an impact overall.""Drinking Buddies"" is really an appropriate name for the film. Not only does it describe Kate and Luke's relationship perfectly, but the film is mostly people sitting around talking while drinking. It's a simple concept, but at the same time it's as if you're getting the chance to become a part of the daily lives of these characters. Getting into that mindset is a serious plus since it makes it seem like there's much more depth to these characters than there really is.This is where the film's impulsive nature starts to work against it. While there are key events in the film that drive the story along everything in between feels rather unremarkable. The film is a comedy, but nothing really makes you laugh. Maybe it'll be different for people who actually drink. In between the comedy, there isn't enough drama or enough romance to really make you care about the few twists and turns along the way. You're mostly just witnessing strangers talk at a bar or in an apartment and it's expected to be amusing. The resolve isn't very satisfying either. There's obviously a connection between Kate and Luke, but the choices they make don't really make any sense. They show all the emotions of jealous lovers, but never really capitalize on that. You've probably never seen a movie end with the passing of a banana, but you're about to.""Drinking Buddies"" is the type of film that seems like it was a really fascinating idea on paper. Being nearly entirely improvised deserves some sort of recognition, but at the same time it lacks the absorbing qualities a polished script and amusing story can contribute. Jake Johnson and Olivia Wilde give some passionate performances, but ""Drinking Buddies"" is otherwise nothing more than a drunken blur that you'll likely forget about by morning. ""Drinking Buddies"" is to drinking what ""Waiting..."" is to the food industry."
There's no there there. The film takes a long time going nowhere. Olivia Wilde is a fine actress but she's wasted here. Seems to be the product of our current culture--mindless superficial in many ways.
"All of the actors/actresses in this film are talented and accomplished. I am not in the film industry so it's difficult to pinpoint what went wrong.Between the screenwriting,the direction,the cuts;something definitely did not work.Olivia Wilde's character ,in this movie, is so incredibly irritating that it was difficult to watch.I have seen her in other story lines and she is likable."
"a late 20s something woman is best friends with her male work colleague at a brewery. the film is them socializing mostly after work; they also have a fight and make up. they go to a cabin with their boyfriend and girlfriend, and their partners share a kiss. all of this happens with what seemed to me to be an excessive amount of beer drinking, making me wonder if the characters were alcoholics. also, for characters drinking the amount of beer they guzzled, don't recall seeing anyone take a bathroom break, nor did any of the characters appear to suffer from beer stomach bloat (which I've seen in real life after people drink lots of beer). I'm middle age and my bladder is not what it once was, and these characters are at least 20 years younger than me, but they were really pouring down the beer and I would've found the story at least somewhat more relateable if the characters had gone to the bathroom after such excessive imbibing. Strength of the story: I think the writer/director wanted to feature a woman/man relationship that wasn't sex-based, which did make for a nice change, but the woman character needed to do something more than break up with her boyfriend, have a one night stand with another work colleague, and have a fight and make up with her best friend, to make the story interesting. The main relationship in the film is the Olivia Wilde character and her male friend, but the story needed to provide more information about them to attach us to them. What I learned principally about them is that they both loved to drink beer: not enough reason for audience members who are non drinkers to form an emotional attachment to them. They don't seem dumb; we just aren't told enough about them to care about them."
"Luke (Jake Johnson) and Kate (Olivia Wilde) work at a micro-brew and spend their nights drinking at a bar. They are close friends. Luke has a girlfriend Jill (Anna Kendrick) who is a teacher and level headed. Kate has been dating Chris (Ron Livingston) for 8 months. He is also level headed. Our foursome go away for a weekend where Chris has the realization Kate is not right for him. He is more interested in Jill. Chris breaks up with Kate which leads to...pretty much nothing except the realization there is life outside of drinking.This is a pretty much been there done that film for me and I was bored from the lack of comedy, action, or drama beyond a sarcastic remark. Not much in entertainment value.F-bomb. Implied sex. Olivia Wilde brief nudity?"
"Decent story line, no dramatics, no suspense. Real interviews are lame and seem like they are interviewing for a UFO abduction, very Sci-Fi. (Which is not a bag thing.)"
"I didn't even make it through this.  It was not convincing, scary or intriguing.  Sorry I paid for it now.  Now I am watching Paranormal Witness and that is quite a bit more interesting. Go watch that instead.  Especially the Curse of Lonergan Farm episode in Season Three."
"Wish I could choose 2 1/2 stars.  What I'm looking for in these shows is quantitative evidence.  The cameras in the house are tampered with post production.  FX are added, etc.This makes the main content badly unbelievable and a construction."
"As much a I love Mark Strong, this series is just not one I could connect to.  I tried.  Several episodes under the belt and the only thought that came to mind was, &#34;Good chance I could find something better to spend money on...&#34;  Degenerate cops going after degenerates is not new territory in TV, but I just wanted to see them all go away.  A better title might have been, &#34;No Winter Sun&#34;.  I gave it a '2' for a couple of good actors who chose a bad project, IMO."
THE CANYONS is a dark film that seems to lose direction from the beginning. Acclaimed director Paul Schrader has gotten lost in a troubled project. Real-life porn actor James Deen stars as movie producer Christian and Lindsay Lohan as his girlfriend Tara. Both live on the wild sexual side as Tara reconnects with an old flame who happens to be Christian's assistant's boyfriend. Everyone seems to have some sort of connection from the past as Christian manipulates and controls all the people around him. Chaos ensures as the lies and deceptions begin to  ruin lives. Christian's dark side emerges and nothing will be the same.There is a story here that gets lost in a world of confusion. The viewer does get drawn into the chaos and the desire to know how this will all work out.The film does almost border on soft porn at times so it can be difficult to understand what is actually happening. A great deal of the film is simply scenes of people driving or walking--walking down a street or climbing stairs or walking down a hall. It is vaguely interesting and there seems to be a hint of a desire to create an art film that falls flat.
"Paul Schrader, oh how you've fallen.  The writer and director of ""American Gigolo"" and the screenwriter of such classics as ""Raging Bull"" and ""Taxi Driver"" has put out this piece of garbage written by Bret Easton Ellis.  Funded in part by Kickstarter, the filmmakers were able to keep Lindsay Lohan out of rehab long enough to play what appears to be a version of herself.  She's not very good and the rest of the cast is even worse.Lindsay plays a one-time actress named Tara who is now in a relationship with Christian (porn star James Deen).  Christian is a small time movie producer, who supplements his income with a trust fund from his father.  One of the conditions of the fund is that he regularly meet with a psychiatrist (director Gus Van Sant slumming).  Christian likes to have other men come over as well as couples.  He enjoys seeing Tara in action with others, it would seem, as much as his one on one time.  Tara goes along, sometimes reluctantly, other times enthusiastically.  If this all sounds pretty sexy, it really isn't.Throughout the movie, Schrader pulls the plug just as it all gets interesting.  This goes for other elements of the plot, as it were, as well.  When Christian suspects Tara is seeing someone else, he has her followed, hacks her phone and has others get information for him.  The other guy (Nolan Gerard Funk) is also having an affair with Christian's assistant (Amanda Brooks).  Then there is Christian's former and sometimes current lover on the side played by Tenille Houston.  It seems that they all know each other but don't know it.  If this sounds convoluted, it is.Nothing makes much sense and if there is anything worse than the acting, it is the script.  All the main characters call each other ""babe.""  Example:  ""Hey babe, how you doin'?""  ""Fine babe, thanks for asking.""  Much of the film reminded me of ""The Californians"" skit on Saturday Night Live that is so funny.  So, what does the film having going for it that I would rate it so high?  Well, the sets are pretty cool.  Christian's pad, set on a secluded mountain side near L. A. (Malibu?), is pretty spectacular.  The soundtrack (mostly Brendan Canning with Me & John) is also noteworthy.  As are Ms. Lohan's ""ta tas.""  Being an equal opportunity filmmaker, Schrader allows Deen and another dude to show why they are so big in the adult film industry.  The film is sometimes titillating but, alas no climax.As far as the Blu ray disc, it does a decent job transferring the bland photography.  Clarity is good.  You can see all the bumps and bruises on Lohan's legs.  The film is cheaply made and it shows, but that is not the fault of the transfer.  In addition to an uncompressed 2.0 stereo track, there is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  Both are good if unspectacular.  The soundtrack sounds very good and dialog is properly focused.  The film includes Spanish and English SDH subtitles.  Extras include a trailer and a couple short featurettes.  Here's a case where a supplement consisting of auditions might have been better than the movie."
"&#34;The Canyons&#34; (2013 release; 99 min.) brings the story of Christian (played by James Deen) and his girlfriend Tara (played by Lindsay Lohan). As the movie opens, the couple is having dinner with another couple, Ryan and Gina, where they all discuss the practical details of a movie Christian is financing and Ryan has been offered the lead role (or has he?). It's not long before we learn that Tara and Ryan are hiding their past (and more). To tell you further details of the plot, would spoil (such as it may) your viewing experience of the movie, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: where, oh where to begin? Let's start with the script, written by Bret Easton Ellis, best known for penning &#34;American Psycho&#34; (the book, not the movie script). The script tries to conjure up some drama in these relationships, when in reality I never felt one iota emotionally connected or involved with any of these characters. The so-called erotic aspects of the movie fare even worse, as they are neither erotic, nor sexy, despite all the nudity. And where was director Paul Schrader in all this? Schrader of course wrote some outstanding scripts for Martin Scorsese (Taxi Drive, Raging Bull) and also directed some great movies in the late 70s/early 80s (Blue Collar; Cat People; American Gigolo). Not much direction in this movie, unfortunately. As to the performances, I felt they were too &#34;acted&#34; (you can practically hear someone yell &#34;and.... ACTION&#34; before the start of various scenes), and simply not credible. On top of that, Lindsay Lohan simply doesn't look good (as in: worn out/drained), sounds tired (with that husky voice) and comes across like she'd rather be at the dentist right now instead of on the screen (the fact that the script gives her some lines in the movie about how bored she is with the movie industry and she wants to do other things, are about as sarcastic as one can imagine, given the circumstances). As it turns out, the best aspect of the movie is actually the soundtrack, scored by Brendan Canning (of Broken Social Scene), and with additional songs from Dum Dum Girls and other indies.Bottom line: this movie is not very good, and there is plenty of blame to go around. If it wasn't that I happen to notice it at my local library here in Cincinnati, I doubt that I would've even picked it up. I cannot recommend this movie in good conscience to anyone. VIEWER BEWARE!"
"Nine Things about The Canyons1. This movie was written by Bret Easton Ellis and directed by Paul Schrader. If you know those names, you will have a pretty good idea what this movie is about. If you don&#8217;t know those names, how about this: It stars Lindsay Lohan and porn star James Deen.2. Paul Schrader summarized the movie the best &#8211; it&#8217;s about beautiful people doing bad things in nice rooms.3. More specifically, it&#8217;s about a girl that wants to make a movie, and she gets her boyfriend cast in it by convincing the producer&#8217;s assistant that he would be a great choice. And they are all secretly cheating on each other. With each other.4. A lot of people, including myself, were looking forward to this movie. It could have been edgy, dark, and hip. The key term here is &#8220;could have been&#8221;.5. This movie is a mess. It turned itself into a parody of what it was trying to do. The acting is terrible. The story is ludicrous, which is especially frustrating to me because Ellis is one of my all-time favorite authors.6. When I say the acting is terrible, there is one exception. Believe it or not, Lindsay Lohan did pretty well. She was the best part of the film. Porn star James Deen has the acting ability of, well, a porn star. Let&#8217;s just leave it at that.7. I do have to give the movie points for having the guts to show male full-frontal nudity, instead of just female nudity.8. The movie is interesting on a meta-level in that you can see how the movie was made. It was funded on Kickstarter and cast through a website. This is obvious. The budget is so low (reportedly, the actors were paid $100 a day) that you can actually see how the thing was put together.9. Fans of bad movies may find this entertaining. It tries so hard to be serious that it turns into a comedy. But as an actual movie, this was one of the biggest disappointments of the year for me."
"The Canyons' is one of those films you hear about, that is so bad that you have to see for yourself. Plus, it was supposed to be the comeback of Lindsay Lohan. What I kept thinking when I saw Lindsay Lohan was the amount of bruises on her legs that were apparently not covered by make-up. It was sloppy, and that is exactly what the film is, sloppy.What we see is the underbelly of Hollywood. The scummy, seamy side. A young, would be starlet, Lindsay Lohan, being kept by a millionaire porn star. Sex with differing couples, or with men whom the porn star has promised a night with Lohan. The plot is thick with wanna be's and with actors working as waiters and bar tenders, selling and playing with sex and drugs on the side. Everyone seems to be a little 'off' is it the drugs or are they all mentally ill? No matter, thus is not a good film. I am not sure if it ever made it to the big screen. Lots of hoopla, where nothing delivers.Not Recommended For Me. prisrob 11-05-13"
"First of all...terrible movie. Second why 2 stars? Simply because of Nolan Funk, I am not sure how such a talented actor got involved in this but it seems he tried his best with what was given him. I believe that even the best actors can be brought down by working with seriously inferior actors, which brings us to Lindsay Lohan, who really thought she was a good idea? it is a barely passable movie, it may have been possible it could have been ok with someone else. She cries (no tears) she purses here lips? her face looks stuck. Moving on now..James Deen, former porn star for real, tried his best too but he seemed like a piece of cardboard, I believe he may get better, but please don't use this film on your resume! Bad dialog and a bad and not very interesting story and I still don't know how I watched it all...oh yeah, Nolan Funk,  I do like him a lot."
They tried to make a reality show off of the success of Downton Abbey. It didn't work. It did not hold my attention. I did not care about the people on the show. I didn't find it one bit interesting. Skip it.
"This may be my fault, I picked it thinking it was a documentary on English manor houses. Turned out it's a soap opera anchored by contemporary regular people who agree to live in a manor house and interact. It's &#34;The Real World - Downton&#34; and not my cup of tea."
No actual show.They are just prepping you for the next season.I wish I hadn't wasted my money on it. Go directly to season 4 and they'll give you a recap.
"Amanda Seyfried is an incredible actress.  In addition, she's a unique beauty and her body is seduction in motion. I have been so used to seeing her in captivating films that when I heard about ""Lovelace""  being made I figured the film would be another interesting indulgence .My thoughts were greatly diminished after viewing , in fact I was in disappointment mode way less than halfway into the film. Seyfried had the right goods for the part, even more so than the real Linda but she just wasn't believable, nor were many of the characters. For a supposedly linear movie it was extremely non cohesive.When Linda enters the world of porn, there is no real feeling of shock. She also  never really questions her lascivious acts early on for someone so brand new. The movie seemed rushed with bits and pieces missing. I'm no raunch fanatic but for a film made in 2012/2013 about the porn industry of the 70s, this was very tame, and every sex scene looked beyond fake. I understand the acters can't really have sex but I've seen more bump and grind in PG13 films..Linda's interactions with her mother and father never explain her life which is what I was hoping for. There were no overtly religious tones throughout.  Also I  found Linda's boyfriend to be a cardboard character that I didn't love to hate, I just hated. I really expected a deeper character development and a capturing of the 70s that never fully panned out. This could have been a fascinating take on a strange passing in time. Unfortunately it was a very poor film that was matched only by the poor happenings it attempted to depict.I even held out hope that as the movie came to a close there would either have been some kind of ""aha"" moment or a sense of completion. Instead it rang hollow. An overall bad project for Amanda Seyfried and company."
"""Lovelace"" is an extreme waste of some talented people.  Amanda Seyfreid plays the lead of a movie supposedly based on the book ""Ordeal"" written by now infamous porn starlet Linda Lovelace.  Ms. Lovelace's claim to fame was her ability to perform a certain sexual act that most people (apparently) did not know existed.  The trouble with the movie is there's just nothing to it:  just several scenes strung together by the flimsiest notion.  No character is given a chance to appear human.  I guess Seyfreid does a so-so job of portraying Linda Lovelace.  Lovelace (who is now deceased from injuries suffered in a car accident) has been out of the spotlight for about 40 years, so unless you are familiar with the back story here, you might be left scratching your head in puzzlement.The movie would have you believe that Lovelace--like so many other girls who ""fall"" into the porn industry--was misled by her mean old boyfriend, who exploited her every chance he got, sexually and mentally abused her, and she was this complete victim.  Welllll....if you do a little research on Ms. Lovelace, you'll find she was not all that innocent, and that only confuses this more for the viewer of this film.  She supposedly did a few ""loop"" films (16mm porn films), and she was involved in beastiality in one of those.  The cameraman on that film was interviewed and stated she ""was a very willing participant"" when she made that film.  I also remember her interview with ""Playboy"" wherein she talked openly about what kind of sex she preferred and in what order.""Lovelace"" tries at break-neck speed to cover all the bases about her life:  how she got started, how she met her boyfriend who got her started, how she SUPPOSEDLY only made the one porn film, i.e. Deep Throat, how she abused drugs, etc., but the film only manages to scratch the surface on EVERY subplot.  Seyfreid's supporting cast includes Chris Noth, Sharon Stone (in one of the WORST fright wigs I've ever seen), and Robert Patrick.I don't know exactly what the director was going for here, but whatever it was, he certainly missed the mark.  Rated ""R"" for sexual situations, violence, and some drug use.  Not Recommended."
"The first series was very enjoyable and strikingly different from most other series on TV.  The characters were introduced and fleshed out in interesting ways, but by series 3 and certainly after that the episodes seem fake and feel almost scripted as if the family is presented with a scenario that they will then improvise.  Whereas the first series felt like a genuine insight into the family life of these self-avowed rednecks, the later series start to feel more like an advertising and merchandising exercise designed to play on the caricatured personalities that each of the players has become.  The gold vein is running out."
It was so boring I have to pass it forward. Although probably it is a market for this kind of movie.
"Too slow to get into. Same thing over & over. Did not keep me interested. Not recommended poor plot,poor acting"
This was another one of those movies with lot's of dialogue that gets muddled by the sound team! There entire conversations between the two main characters that I could not understand! It's unfortunate because otherwise it was a good movie.
"Because all of those middle American hicks have got nothing better to do with themselves but to either (A) hunt or (B) sit back and watch the paint dry.  Ain&#8217;t one of &#8216;em who&#8217;s got a respectable job.  Ain&#8217;t one of &#8216;em showers regularly.  Ain&#8217;t one of &#8216;em would ever vote for a Democrat.  Why, even that form of English they speak?  That ain&#8217;t English!  Well, it ain&#8217;t English like you and I speak!  They may as well be from some Third World country, what with their morals, their values, and their clinging to Constitutional respectability!  It&#8217;s enough to make a Progressive write a novel, pen a screenplay, and release it to the masses for their consumption!Is it any wonder that these films don&#8217;t make a respectable buck anymore?  According to IMDB, this one didn&#8217;t even get anywhere near six digits.  Maybe there&#8217;s a lesson worth putting on film, no?(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)On the surface, John Moon (played by the reliable Sam Rockwell) hasn&#8217;t got much to live for.  His wife&#8217;s left him.  She&#8217;s taken his son along when she checked out.  He&#8217;s holed up in a trailer between a rock and nowhere.  No job.  A beat-up old truck.  In fact, all he has is his guns and his hunting.  One day &#8211; while out trying to poach a deer in order to have something to eat &#8211; he fires into a cluster of greenery and accidentally shoots a fashion model.  (True story.)  Rather than report it to the police (as the typical Hollywood backwoods type, he&#8217;s already got three strikes against him, see), he hauls her back to the burned out semi-truck trailer she&#8217;s been living in for a decent burial.  Instead of finding answer, he finds a load of cash &#8230; which he promptly steals and leaves the body to rot.  Before long, the men looking for the money come knocking, and guess who they figure right away has absconded with their loot?To be fair, A SINGLE SHOT isn&#8217;t an inconceivably bad as I perhaps made it out to be in the plot synopsis, but it is inconceivably conceived.  For starters, I don&#8217;t know (nor have I personally met) any hunter who would blindly fire into a clump of green with only the modest hope of bagging himself a deer; but that kind of irresponsible misrepresentation has never stopped Hollywood from indicting any member of the NRA.  Nor did I for a moment believe Moon&#8217;s characterization as constructed by Matthew F. Jones in his screenplay (based on his own novel).  For instance, I found it entirely authentic that Moon &#8211; a man who threw up at the discovery of what he&#8217;d done so horribly wrong upon seeing the young woman&#8217;s body &#8211; would suddenly cook up the idea of carrying through the forest, finding where she hid out, and set it all up to look like a murder someone else committed.Seriously?  Is there no artistic integrity left?Not only that, but even director David Rosenthal didn&#8217;t see through the hogwash.  Desperate to preserve what semblance of a family he has left, Moon&#8217;s willing to threaten others at the point of a gun, turn down a decent chance at employment, and ignore any measure of personal hygiene?  What &#8211; pray tell! &#8211; caused him to fall into such a deplorable state?  Perhaps there was something in here &#8211; some inkling as to what magic act brought the man to such a lowly state &#8211; but, unfortunately, Rosenthal was more interested in having the majority of his actors speak in arguably the worst set of Southern accents this side of rural Alabama!  Seriously, Jeffrey Wright and Ted Levine appeared in small but pivotal roles, but, without the advent of English subtitles, I couldn&#8217;t understand a word of what they were saying!Still, I&#8217;ll give points for efforts.  A SINGLE SHOT is loaded with some nice cinematography (though Rosenthal probably never met a lighting technician he ever liked), and there are some nice nuances to Rockwell&#8217;s performance, along with the usual bankable work by William H. Macy (who proves even small-town lawyers are sleazy) and Kelly Reilly as the estranged wife who only wants what&#8217;s best for her son &#8230; even if that means having her co-worker with a penchant for watching porn go babysit her young son.A SINGLE SHOT [2013] is produced by United Pictures, Media House Capital, A Single Shot Productions, Bron Studios, Demarset Films, and Unanimous Pictures.  DVD distribution is being handled by Well Go USA Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications?  Well, it&#8217;s certainly brimming with some solid cinematography, but &#8211; probably for thematic reasons &#8211; director Rosenthal felt it necessary to drape far too many shots in darkness.  (Yeah, I &#8216;get&#8217; that it&#8217;s atmospheric, but it&#8217;d be nice to &#8216;see&#8217; things clearly every now and then.)  And don&#8217;t even get me started on the dialogue &#8211; suffice it to say I had to use the English subtitle track on more occasions than I should have.  If it&#8217;s special features you&#8217;re looking for, then you have a respectable &#8216;making of&#8217; short along with some actor interviews with which to get all hot and bothered.  (I didn&#8217;t.)RECOMMENDED but hugely disappointing.  A SINGLE SHOT creates an interesting but entirely Hollywood-driven atmosphere of rural, backwoods, and/or mountainous America in yet another &#8220;thriller&#8221; lacking any real thrills.  They (studio people) really want you to believe that these folks (hunters, farmers, and other small town types) are dangerous.  They (those same studio suits) really want you to understand just how wretched, crooked, and deceitful they are.  In fact, they (once more, Tinseltown regulars) are convinced that, if something isn&#8217;t done about these gun-carrying, Bible-thumping types, we&#8217;re all going to Hades in a handbasket.  Truth hurts &#8230; but, once again, the truth is on the wrong side of the camera.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Well Go USA Entertainment provided me with a DVD copy of A SINGLE SHOT by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
"&#34;I'm gonna find you.&#34; John Moon (Rockwell) is trying everything he can to reconnect with his wife and child. Spending his time between living in his cabin and trying to fit in in town. When he finds a young woman in the woods his life takes a dangerous turn and now he must not only fight to get back with the woman he loves but also for his life. I watched this movie for really only one reason, Sam Rockwell. After watching it I have to say there is really only one reason to watch this, Sam Rockwell. To me he is one of the most underrated actors alive (Paul Giamatti & Giovanni Ribisi would also be on list) and he again shows why in this movie. If anyone but him was the lead in this it would be unwatchable. The movie itself is so slow moving that I found it hard to stay interested in but he brought a depth to the character that really helped and made you want to see him succeed in everything he was doing. Other then that though this is just really to slow moving to recommend. Overall, a movie to watch to see the brilliance of Sam Rockwell. I give it a C+."
"While I love he focused on clean eating, I was only able to handle 1.5 episodes. His delivery is juvenile. It is like he is trying to be the &#34;Bill Nye the Science Guy&#34; of cooking."
I am watching this program and with Robin Williams - he is trying so hard to be great with bad material. All the cast works well together but get some better scripts
Robin Williams is amazing I am not sure this show has any content left it is slowing down for me. It will make you laugh but every week seems to be the same stuff. I doubt I would watch a season 2 of this show.
"Robin Williams plays this zany ad guy as so over-the-top, he isn't funny. Just a ham actor pushing his laugh lines. I was seriously disappointed. My recommendation? No, thanks."
Episode 1 was boring. Too contrived. Its just not compelling to watch. Robin Williams is funny but that isn't enough to keep me interested for more than 5 minutes.
"Nothing about this show grabbed me. I love the characters individually, but they just don't meld together. It's not horrible, just boring to me."
"If you've made it this far in HIMYM, you're going to want to finish out the series.  Season 9 is worth watching through if only for completeness sake, but it doesn't stack up against the other 9 season of the show.The basic setup has been altered significantly.  For one thing, season 9 features an all new setting/backdrop.  In addition, the characters are very rarely shown all together, instead ending up in groups of just 2 or 3 for most episodes.  The result is that the basic formula that made How I Met Your Mother such a hit has fundamentally changed for this season.There are, of course, some moments of greatness.  Certain episodes rank among the best of the series, but overall this season is a disappointment.  I recommend watching through if you're a die-hard fan of the series, but it might be worth catching re-runs on TV rather than buying the set."
"Spoilers: All the character build up didn't mean anything in the end. Alan in Hangover 3 yelling at Stu for learning absolutely nothing reminds me of Ted and Barney in the finale. Barney spent years becoming a better man for Robin to suddenly not like traveling so much with her for her job, time for a divorce! Come on! Two years of slowly building up towards their wedding just to end it in one episode! Then Barney reverts back to his old ways and picks up women in front of his ex wife.And waiting years to see who the mom is, we meet her and love her but she dies. It's all good; Ted still loves Robin and his kids are cool with him moving on. Most of the series showed us why Robin and Ted doesn't work.Now we have a spinoff to look forward to (How I Met Your Dad). 9 yrs later ""And kids that's how I met your dad; too bad he was hit by a truck yesterday, is it cool if I date the now single mail man who always smiled at me ?"""
This last season was ridiculously bad. so disappointed that I actually paid for any of it. the last episodes were the worst.
"Updated Dec. 11, 2013: I used to LOVE NCIS. When Ziva left it was a bummer, but the guys & Abby were doing fine. Mark Harmon rocks as always. However, this Bishop character is irritating. In her debut episode, I felt she was a bit interesting as a temporary character, and when it was obvious she would become more permanent I wondered how that would be. Watching this episode, I have to say UGH. So immature and wish she would just stop talking, stop making faces, just grow up. Seriously, to replace extremely classy Cote w/this character is like bringing a barn animal to dinner at the palace. NCIS has always had mature, elegant actors. Why ruin it now? Unless they want the show to fail... maybe the writers are tired and want to end with season 11. Just thinking now of Prentis, who was with Criminal Minds. Now that would have been a very cool choice for a replacement. Sadly, I won't be looking forward to the next episodes as I used to, and may not even watch anymore. Too bad because NCIS used to be one of the very few great shows left."
"2 stars because I still love the idea of the show. It's been my absolute favorite for 10 1/2 seasons. Now, I'm sure that Ellie Bishop's character is well liked by many, but the character/actress has screwed up the awesome dynamics that this show has always had. Kate had it, Ziva had it, Ellie does not. Now matter how quirky, smart, or whatever they try to make her, she doesn't fit with the group. The other actors, to be quite honest, don't even seem like they enjoy having her there. There is zero chemistry between her and anyone else on the team. They needed a stronger actress who could give us a character with some real depth instead of this constant ""I'm better than you and everyone knows it"" crap. Sorry, just upsetting to see a great show take a back seat. I have watched my last new episode of NCIS until they come up with a character who fits, or do what they did in the beginning of season 11 and rotate guest agents who add some humor. I'm going back to watch from the beginning."
"I love CCH Pounder but please, write a good script for her! I turned part II off before the end.  I'm sure I won't watch the new series unless they get some decent scripts, clean up the dark, grimy locations, and get the lead out of the characters rear-ends. NOLA may be a slow, not-so-clean, easy moving city, but a little bit of that goes a long, long way. Come on CBS! Home run from JAG to NCIS to NCIS LA... and now a dark, snoozefest of a show. Not quite the standard I've come to expect."
"I picked up this series as a huge fan of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes.  I really liked the changes they made with a female Watson and a female Moriarty. I think his drug addiction was depicted a lot more severely than the the original, but I wrote that off as artistic license.The part that lost me has been the last season.  I appreciated this show because of the platonic relationship between Holmes and Watson. When they Introduced Mycroft, I had no real problem with him because he had no real part in the story, even though I thought the casting was TERRIBLE for Mycroft. They could have chosen someone far more appealing. Anyway, when they had the affair between Mycroft and Watson, I lost it. The ONE thing that made this show work was the TOTAL LACK of any kind of romantic or sexual relationships (between meaningful characters at least), and I found that it introduced dynamics into the show that are unsustainable. Already Watson is talking about moving out of the Brownstone, (something that never happened in the original Sherlock books). And now again is the initiation of a real relationship between her and Mycroft.  The endpoint of either one of these possibilities is dissolution of the partnership, which I believe is the one constant in any form of the Sherlock incarnations.Mad that they had to go and ruin one of the best series out there with really bad choices."
"Elementary?  Yes.  In concept, presentation, and take-away messages.  Okay if you have absolutely nothing else to do, such as cleaning your toe nails, scrubbing the bathroom floor, pulling weeds.  Otherwise, I suggest you pass."
"This show represents nepotism carried to utterly ridiculous extremes, tediously characterized by the aggravatingly obligatory &#34;family dinners&#34;, headed by Tom Selleck whose face seems permanently frozen in a perpetual scowl. In the long ago and far away, Selleck as Magnum P.I. was a great serio-comic character, a persona he maintained, at least to some degree, in his later TV and film vehicles. With the Jesse Stone films, however, he began taking on a darker, heavier persona, although still effective and often funny. With Blue Bloods, though, his acting seems to have become wooden and much too predictable, his mouth a perfect reflection of his grim, down-curling mustache. The twinkle of wit that once made him so likeable is completely gone. His rigid, moralizing righteousness and scarcely credible &#34;objectivity&#34; where his family members are concerned strains credulity.Donnie Wahlberg's character is, like Selleck's, mostly just gratingly irritating and seems interminably locked into a constant, growlingly foul mood. Will Estes, as the boyish cop in the family, is just that &#8212; absurdly boyish and barely believable. Worse, he's Wahlberg's &#34;kid brother&#34; as well as Selleck's youngest son. What is this, Family Affair in Blue? Having more than one member of a family be a part of the police force or justice system may not be too far-fetched, but this is ridiculous. Even Len Carriou plays not only Selleck's father, but the former Police Commissioner and the supposed eminence grise at the invariable family dinners.The least believable part of this series is this very fact that everyone in the entire family either works directly for or is part of the same legal system as New York Police Commissioner Selleck, creating endless conflicts of interest that no justice system could or should ever tolerate. Only Bridget Moynihan's character is even slightly tangential to Selleck's authority, but they are all perpetually airing their professional problems at those exasperating family dinners where even the kids get to throw in their two cents worth of wisdom and insight. For awhile, I liked this show, but its repetitive and entirely predictable formula eventually grinds down your tolerance for all the other situational improbabilities and annoying characters."
My first question is how can Ichybod's police partner stand to have him in the same car with her. Ichybod (an intentional misspelling) is still wearing the same cloths that he was wearing when he crawled out of the hole he was buried in for over 200 years and he still looks just as dirty. I could go on but I think the other reviewers that gave it a low rating pretty well covers it.
"they tell you too much by way of montage and while the acting is generally pretty good, the characters stories lack depth and a meaningful interconnectedness in such a way that it would draw you in.  It falls flat and both my husband and I got bored with it.  Too bad as it has potential."
Ichabod Crane wakes in modern day America to deal with the devil...Only once or twice does the main character question things to which he is exposed which would root an average person to the spot gazing in wonder. Does nothing to challenge the viewer to become empathetic with any the characters.Just doesn't do it for me. Piling on more bizarre villains and even less credible special effects makes this a serial video game for the less inquisitive mind. Poorly written and plotted.
"I'm just not into dead people walking. The Bible is a work of fiction that began controlling this world ever since it was written 2700 years ago (old testament) but the Bible was finished with the worst book of them all ""Revelation"". The idea that people are going watch this series and enjoy it makes my skin crawl. Sleepy Hollow series, I fear, will not die just like the headless horseman."
Loved New Girl Season 1 and 2. Season 3 really disappoints. The funny banter from the first two seasons seems forced and contrived this season. I'm having a hard time bringing myself to watch it.
"Recently, the plot is not changing.  The story lines are becoming rather stagnant.  Many sitcoms unfortunately fall into this pattern."
"I have been a Survivor fan since Season 1 and had high hopes for this season.  After three episodes I abandoned it.  None of the cast was that interesting and most were uttering disinteresting--or flat annoying.  The challenges were stale rehashes of past seasons, and the setting was yet another generic tropical beach.  Is Mark Burnett trying to get this show voted off of the network island?"
"Yeah, well, I have no idea what I just watched.  It was like a drunken conversation come to life.  A monster who looks like he escaped from an 80's horror flick like Ghoulies or Troll crawls out of a guy's ass--literally--and kills people who may bring the guy harm or undue stress.First, thank GOD Michael Bay did not make this film.  The plot is up his alley, but I think no one would be able to take his obsession with explosions.  If you get me.Secondly, I have no idea why you might WANT to watch this movie.  You have to be REALLY bored, 12 years old, or just love butt horror.  (Is that a genre now?)Here's why:I love a couple of the cast, so I thought it might be funny.  Unfortunately, it is just slow and silly.  What is funny is that the acting is pretty great!  I guess, if it had been written well, Bad Milo might have been a comedic hit.Instead it is a smirk-fest.  It gets old fast.Give it a try if you love offbeat comedy.  I wanted to like it, but it was just plain dull."
"Watched the first 3 episodes. Not impressed. The characters are so cliche it's painful, the two scientists are the same character separated only by name and body.. The saving grace of this show is just showing that Coulson lived. VFX are good but the writing and characters are so bland it's just not up to par with some of the shows coming out this season. I may come back to it during the summer when there's nothing to watch but for now other shows are more worth my time."
"This is just a generic, cookie cutter adventure series with the Marvel name slapped on it. The sole connection to the Marvel universe is the character of Coulson, who otherwise brings nothing to the show. There are occasional gratuitous references to the Avengers and the invasion of New York.The rest of the characters are stereotypes and none of the actors are convincing in these roles. Not only are they too young to possess the skills they pretend to have, their acting is wooden and the chemistry among the cast non-existent."
"Joss Whedon is beloved because of Firefly.  I liked Firefly a lot, but after seeing seeing more of Joss Whedon's work, I realize what a terrible writer he is.  Whedon writes all his male characters as sexless, affable dimwits ""smores are full of marshmallowy goodness"" and makes his female characters cliched superheroes.  He goes out of his way to cast men who come off as harmless buffoons or as sexless or mildly effeminate (the doctor from Firefly).  That way the ""women"" don't get any focus taken off of them.  I put quotes around 'women' because his female characters are usually one dimensional, unlike someone like Starbuck from Battlestar Galactica who actually has some complexity and shows a wide range of emotion.  Add to that the stock sci fi plots and the ridiculously young and attractive actors and you have a female friendly version of JJ Abrams.Agents of SHIELD is the worst thing Whedon has done.  Alluding to my header, in the last episode I saw, the 40 plus year old leader of Shield, Coulson says something like, ""I'm about to have a spaz attack.""  Coulson is the same affable oaf we are used to seeing with Whedon.  The worst written man on Game of Thrones is better than the best male character Whedon ever wrote.All the obsession about levels and getting into SHIELD reminds me of the dorkyness of Star Trek.  There's a scene where 20 FBI agents surrounded the unarmed black ops SHIELD guy who, of course escaped unscathed.  That's because he's level 8 which means a +10 dexterity and 50 percent chance for a critical miss.  At level 9 he could have done the same thing blindfolded.I saw three episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, shocked that actual adults love it to this day.  It's so poorly written, acted, the stunt doubles are so noticeable, and the vampires look like they're wearing Halloween masks.  It's cosmically bad.  Did I say 'bad'?  I meant 'postmodern.'  Why do so many experts say how brilliant this guy is?I wrote this review after seeing an interview with Joss Whedon.  People's reverence for this gentle tool, who is probably only capable of one or two serious erections a month, really annoys me.  I hate it when people don't recognize when something is banal (Once Upon a Time) because I'm sick of only having three shows to watch:  Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, and Orphan Black.edit:  The last episode I watched involved the black ops guy having to survive alone in the woods with a dog.  I am aware of Nazi SS training techniques, so I knew what was coming.  I fast forwarded through the episode, and sure enough I was right.  If you are gonna make a cheesy and cornball series, you shouldn't have such dark and unpleasant moments that don't fit with the mood of the series.  I wish people shared my taste, but judging by other reviews, I think I'm doomed to half a dozen quality shows a decade."
"Like any Joss Whedon fan, I was excited to see his return to television. I grew up watching shows like Buffy and Angel, and have always been a diehard fan of Serenity's crew (those characters were tailored-made for the actors who portrayed them). I have tried to like Agents of Shield, but I find myself doing other things not even halfway through the show. It just...lacks. There doesn't seem to be any coherent storyline being portrayed, none of the characters, other than the would-be hacker/spy, are being developed or given a background. Clark Gregg is a master of the subtle joke and his half-smile is almost his signature look, yet his character is trying to be this hard-azz, no nonsense sort of leader which I never saw him being in any of the movies. Yes, he took his job seriously, but always with a healthy dose of, ""Can you believe this s***z is happening?"" The two geeky lab rats need to be put in the airlock and left there at 40,000 feet with the door open; perhaps then they wouldn't be quite so annoying to listen to. Why do unimaginably intelligent people have to be portrayed as wacky or skewed? Ming Na is just sort of there; a character with this apparent bad-azz reputation we only get glimpses of in offhand remarks. Yet, she is relegated to airplane pilot? The male agent is seriously just there as eye-candy, to hopefully bring in some younger women into the view. I feel bad for the actor, really, his character is about as shallow and typical as they come. I hope that in the future the show finds its true sea-legs and settles down into the kickazz show it could be. If the studio is worried about it becoming another, ""Firefly,"" where the show was more character interaction than action (and was so much better for it), and thinks the audience wants all action and no substance, then perhaps they should let this show become the next ""Firefly"" because I for one would be a fan for life if I saw that same charisma  in A.o.S."
"Didn't want to pay for what I can watch for my already expensive subscription to Dish TV.  Therefore, it's nothing new and not worth viewing on Amazon."
"Joss Whedon has done a lot of terrific TV projects and I continuously wish him a lot of work and success. This is not one of those unfortunately, and I suggest it will probably not make it to a second season, and definitely not past 2 seasons.The fatal flaw is the casting. The lead actor Clark Gregg who plays Poulson just doesn't have enough charisma to anchor a show. Additionally, he can't pull off the Whedon voice. The sarcasm and irony are awkward on him.  The second fatal casting flaw can be summed up in three words that are synonymous with untalented actor: Ming. Na. Wen.  Ming Na-Wen is a so thoroughly untalented actor that she could not even convincingly portray an over-the-hill Chinese actress.  Maybe, and I stress MAYBE, she could convincingly portray a dead body, but likely only with the help of a heavy sedative."
"Shocking that this is still on air. Nothing makes sense, the characters are illogical, as are the stories. A waste of some talented actors and not an opportunity for others who just can't get their acting chops together."
"I want to like this, I really do. I grew up with Marvel comics when they were 25 cents and less. This show, man this show. Colson's character isn't strong. I feel like I'm watching a USA Network version of CSI Marvel. One cameo of Fury, nothing else.  It's hollow, the two best characters are the scientists. The ""me"" generation hacker chick, come on... Someone please take the helm on this thing and deliver some real content.  I'm actually upset I spent money on the whole season.  Colson hasn't even driven the damn Corvette but once.  S*** give me something for Christ's sake. No way I'm renewing if this crap bonanza keeps going, no way.  If this was a pile of s*** it wouldn't even stink."
"The pilot did not capture me and the following episodes were equally dismal.  There is an attempt to bring a lot of anger and sexuality to serious issues....shouldn't we be trying to remove the anger, and leave the sexuality to our personal life?"
"UPDATE: Well apparently most of America agreed with me and NBC is putting this pathetic retread out of it's misery.You got to be kidding me, of ALL the ideas for TV plots the best these guys could do was a rehash of a old TV crime drama?  Is the talent level in Hollywood so pathetic that they can't come up with more original programming?  I am not going to bother to get involved in this series because it is not going to make it past 1 Season good or bad that is just the fact.  People want something new, not the same old plot devices remolded to look new. The use of a male ""hunk"" as the crippled Ironsides was just another horrible move, NBC has been on the bottom for years and it looks like that will continue.  They need new management when they can land something as exceptional as Blacklist and then come along with this travesty of a show.  No consistency at all."
"I'm old enough to remember the old ironside and I LOVE Blair Underwood, so I thought that this would be a great series. I can't honestly even begin to wonder what they were thinking when they wrote the script. Horrible at best. I'll let you decide. I watched the whole thing hoping it would somehow get better towards the end, didn't happen. Total waste of my money."
I suppose that remakes are necessary when writers have nothing better to do. They should have left this one alone!
"The show and characters were most entertaining in the first season... Now the lead ladies are morally void and loose, therefore terrible models of professional women.  Please....  The male characters are actually much nicer people!  Fire and rescue scenes bloody but interesting re: techniques used and dedication to those they try to save, showing good professional ethics and bravery."
"FBI Agent Booth used to be a character of substance with real responsibilities and a mature relationship with a brilliant woman.  No more.  Instead, he is becoming dense, silly and a curious match for Dr. Brennan.  There is no depth of character, for example, in the final scene of this episode (I will not spoil it) and he comes off as pathetic, seeking attention and certainly not adult.  What is happening to this valued character who had so much to contribute before?  Writers, take note."
"oh right, in any movie where a murder/psychopath/monster/alien is being chased or is chasing the &#34;good guys&#34; on the same sets we've seen before - they have Barbie's Space Craft, with strobe lighting, steam, webbing and blast holes painted on the walls and Barbies Crawl Space with strobe lighting, steam, webbing and blast holes painted on the walls.The monster/alien/psychopath always has superior abilities/technology and yet when given any of several chances to off the &#34;good guys&#34; monster/alien/psychopath always turns and runs because, I guess, if they actually took the killing shot when they could the movie would be over and they still have 90 some pages of script to work through.there is sci fi - 2001 for instance, and there are westerns in spacethjs is a space western which is two steps down from spaghetti westernyee ha"
"I jumped ship and haven't looked back. Both shows used to be witty and had good writing with tie-in twists at the end like Seinfeld. Now they resort to disgusting poop and jizz senarios. All these comedic actors and that's what they come up with or sign off on. Sunny in Philly is the same way, screaming and hollering to no end. Not funny. These shows are now suited for ten year old boys."
"Unfortunately, The League has been going downhill since season 3. The comedy and story lines for season four were iffy. If you were a fan, you watched and found the funny bit. Season 5 has been horrendous. It resembles nothing of the comedy/humor that made it a hit. The story lines are outrageous. They rarely play football. I would be hard pressed to say it even focuses on the lives of Kevin, Ruxin, Taco, Pete, and Jenny. They are going to have to pull it together quickly. I am not a football fan. I found this show hilarious based on the characters, storylines, and actors."
"I normally love this show, love that it's like Seinfeld on meth... This show has an edge you don't find almost anywhere else.. That said, what worked for they gang in seasons 1-8 has left them far behind in season nine (writing). The Gang Breaks Dee was fine, funny, but the ending left a residue of what was to come.. and some of the episodes in season nine were so dull that I couldn't even finish them; The Gang Saves the Day & The Gang Makes Lethal weapon 6 (let the LW thing go already, it was barely funny a few seasons back). The shows used to thrive on subtle narcissism, but now it's just generally sadistic.. Dennis used to be somewhat likeable, but he is without a doubt, pure evil.. He's a serial killer waiting to happen.. With friends like these, what's the point? I know it was renewed for a tenth season, which is good; all shows are entitled to a horrible season, but I hope nothing else is like this.. Some people complain that season five was bad, I disagree, it's season nine.. Horrible."
Season 1 was a lot more action packed and there was a great deal more evidence.  This season has become a real yawner.  Three shows were done around an EVP in Chinese.  Then they tarted looking for evidence in outlying areas...apparently nothing of real import happening in the mine?  Too bad.  It was so promising in the first season.
"It's gotten to where I can't trust any of these shows. In search of Bigfoot, Seasons 1-4, and they never find Bigfoot, and all they can provide is about a dozen blurry photos or videos and a couple of eye shine shots! This haunted mine series is FAKE, just like the others. The cast consists of paid actors and a set they blew up when the season ended. Never fear, though; they found another mine coincidentally that's even bigger and scarier than the first. But will the execs sign off on it? Probably. This is why MGM sacked good quality shows like Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis for low budget garbage like this. Also, if you're going to be a ghost hunter, stop screaming every time you see a shadow person or hear a voice. If you're going to be doing this for a living, grow a backbone fer goodness sake! And please stop doing the EVPs where you conduct scrappy ghost interviews. ""Is anyone here? How many of you are there? Do you want us to leave?"" I could write this stuff in my sleep!"
very committed to the storyline but ultimately a big disbelief - did MK ULTRA take over or something?No mother would be okay with this happening to their son.
"Two beautiful, talented actresses, Naomi Watts and Robin Wright are wasted in this terrible story.  It's not only a creepy premise---that they each fall in love with the others' son, but it's totally unrealistic.  If you turn the sound off and just look at the beautiful bodies and the beach scenes, you might enjoy it.."
"Occasionally I'm pleasantly surprised by a 'B' bin movie. In the same genre I quite enjoyed &#34;eight legged freaks&#34; which was silly fun with surprisingly competent special effects. Sadly, however, this film does not deliver. Two stars is quite generous for what a film that is full of missed opportunities for humor, satire, irony and just plain fun. Not as badly made as the typical SyFy channel movie (which is the hallmark of absolute horribleness) however this film doesn't rank much above the offal they typically serve up."
"I'm really amazed at all the critical praise and positive reviews for &#34;Big Ass Spider&#34;. A few of the gags worked, but most of the lines were poorly-timed, and the banter between the two male leads seemed forced and flat. In fact, the entire film looked to have been directed by someone whom has never done comedy before. I gave it two stars for a few good shots and laughs, but mostly I sat in my chair wishing I had my $4.99 back."
I purchased this strictly on the reviews. I dig camp and looked forward to a few yuks. What I got was lame and stupid.
"Otherwise this show would have had real potential.  She's bland, vapid, and has no oomph.  Maybe he wanted to shine, but it does a disservice to his acting genius, and also makes the show boring.  Also, too many unlikely triumphs for him, would be good to see him suffer a bit, make mistakes.  Writing poor."
"I was very excited to hear that Mr. Spader was returning to television in The Blacklist.  I enjoyed his portrayal of Alan Shore in The Practice and Boston Legal very much.  He has also done some great acting in movies and other series.  That said he can't save The Blacklist from being incredibly silly and unrealistic.  Rocky and Bullwinkle were involved in more realistic espionage operations.  Completely over the top.  I can suspend my disbelief quite a bit but not to the extent that the writers are asking me to.  Did they even do basic research on the operational mandate of the FBI?  LOL.  If in episode two, Spader wakes up in a pod wired up by the machine overlords to be a battery for their civilization and it turns out that the whole plot of the first show was just a dream to keep him under control I might continue watching."
"After seeing the pilot I was hopeful for an exciting and enjoyable season. The premise made sense and the acting was great (especially James Spader  and Megan Boone). That said, I was greatly disappointed by Episode 2, which crammed a complex story into a short running time and did not offer meaningful character development. What a waste! I hope subsequent episodes are better."
"I loved, loved loved the previews and could not WAIT for this show.First thing you will notice is that the lead has a dumpy feel to him. He's pudgy. The girl looks dead most of the time...lifeless eyes. I know we are supposed to get that she dislikes this job, but somehow I think that is a luxury she can ill afford. She is brand new and she needs him.It is also unbelievable that she would talk back to her boss the way she does. The characters are just poorly developed.The writing is not there. Obviously, she is this criminal's daughter. Obviously. The plots are hard to follow and wobble upon a heavy amount of violence. All of that bloody encounter with her husband and then the cutting off of the hand in the last episode... just disgusting. I assume NBC would like to keep a few women in the audience...and we are leaving.I do like that we are unsure about her husband...that is a good mystery.The saving grace about the show is the internal FBI details as well as the premise. But it is never clear from the writing how he is aware of the criminal activity. You have to make the show believable.Here is another example of poor plotting, poor characterization. The lead obviously wants to spend time with the girl. The dinner was the perfect time to do that. But for no apparent reason, he bolts and runs in the middle of the dinner. I know the point is to add some action, but it just seems to me that it should happen at the end of the dinner.I am completely disppointed. It would be nice if the producers would watch The Good Wife and see how beautifully and richly the characters are drawn.I am adding some thoughts because I want to love this show:Punch it up with a new hot  criminal...with a 007 feel to him. A hot sexy guy. The pudgy guy could compete with him, mentor him, or just plain disappear. Punch it up more with a sexy female opposite 007 who has some edge to her...think patty nyholm on The Good Wife...what a great, smart character. But a sexier patty. That would definitely juice up the show. And get writers..good ones. Ones that understand character, can write a good plot, and can throw in some humor. And drop the violence...assuming you want women viewers. Come on...you can do it! NBC needs you, fer sher.UPDATE: I definitely saw the handwriting on this wall---the previews for the last show were so violent and horror filled that I passed. Good luck with this sort of writing."
Some episodes are better than others. The acting is quite good...Spader the best... and there is suspense but not a single character really grabs me. Unlike The Shield and Justified I could stop watching it and not feel cheated.
"Started out interesting, but I dropped it after a couple of shows.  I like a series that I care about at least some of the characters but I found none of the main characters to be anyone I could work up any enthusiasm for.  And the plots were a bit too outlandish.  I don't have a lot of free time so I choose my viewing carefully."
"The concept was good, as was the dialogue, but the two lead actors did not seem to really fill their roles. Perhaps they were miscast. The performer who played the sufragette was the only reason I stayed with it for two episodes. She was charming and very likable. The lead actor (Benedict Cumberbatch) should have been likable but had no redeeming qualities."
"Despite being an Anglophile, after watching the first episode I just haven't bothered watching the rest.  Parade's End is beautifully done with all the attention to detail and period touches we've come to expect from productions of this caliber.  The acting is good too, but I just couldn't connect with the character's motives.For example, with the central married couple: the husband (and show's main character), meets his future wife on a train and falls so hard and fast for her that despite his gentlemanly, old fashioned scruples, they have one-off sex right then and there in the train car.  But in every other scene he is excruciatingly well-mannered and honorable and he sacrifices his own happiness and reputation to do the right thing by this two-timing, family-abandoning, excused of a wife.  She is supposed to be such a fun upperclass femme fatale, but the only side we are shown of hers is that of a homewrecking, love them and leave them beast.  She's not charming or crazy beautiful, she doesn't seem to care about anything or anybody, so what gives?It's not upliftng but depressing, and next we get to see how WWI affects these charming characters, really? I was looking forward to enjoying this show, but I can't seem to bring myself to watch beyond the first episode."
"Was excited to see this, but I kept waiting for it to get good.Very predictable, very blah. I zoned out by the start of episode three"
"I get it, the writers were dealt a huge blow with the loss of Cory Monteith, and half the Glee club graduated.  Now Glee club has been disbanded and Will, Emma, Sue, and coach Biest are gone, as well as the talented new members.  It's not really Glee anymore.  I'll still watch.  I can't imagine that it will get picked up for season 6.  I hope it does, but I doubt it.  Glee was pretty good at weaving real life social issues into the show, I was hoping they would incorporate the lesson of heroin use into the show and how one person touches and affects so many other lives."
I fell sleep watching it. Hope for fans it turns out better other shows.its not for young people over the age of 17.
"I tried watching it and I finally gave up on it after this past episode.  There was minimal effort to find the shifter.  All the immortal witch did was cast a spell which she could have done in the beginning but no she doesn't want her girls to practice the craft or they will be found out and killed again since they are cursed.  Yes, I know there is someone behind the shifter and I really don't care anymore.  The show focuses more of the younger daughter and her love triangle between two brothers, then on the older sister and her romance with the police officer then finally on the ""who's behind the...""  The show seems very soap opera in its direction and the acting seems a bit overly acted trying to add a dramatic flair to the show. I found the acting and the character of Ingrid extremely annoying and am surprised she hasn't been burned at the stake yet."
"Charmed was inexplicably popular, even though the acting was poor, the characters weak and uninteresting, and the production low quality. The new series is better, with one fewer sister, and the addition of a mother and aunt. The writers face the common problem with magical characters in that they must face some sort of danger, yet also be powerful enough to reliably triumph. The solution to the dilemma is to make continual references to how powerful they are, yet provide some reason why they are incompetent for the bulk of each episode. This gets sort of tiresome in that it's hard to cheer for such weak and helpless people, and who don't seem interested in learning magic. Who among the audience wouldn't find themselves practicing every waking moment if they discovered they could do magic?I suppose you could generate some sympathy for the characters if they were actually likeable, but with the exception of the aunt, they're all pretty bland people."
"I really wanted to like this, but does anybody writing these shows know anything about Wicca?  You can't tell it from the stories."
Acting not so great. Story line cheesy. The coven is awesome. Not engaging enough for me. Not my style. Sorry
"So far, only the two minute preview was available and it was not enough information for me to make a decision. It did not keep my interest."
"Camera work is good LOL, but the acting doesn't is more suited to promotional or commercials you see on tv for bacon. The writing/dialogue is so, so and doesn't really keep my interest. The director should be slap for going along with all the other nonsense in this series. I'd save your money and wait for a better magical base show before I'd pay for Witches of East End."
"I grew up on Alex P. Keaton and Mike Flaherty. So when Michael J. Fox announced his TV return, I was estatic. And after he did return, I am heartbroken.My personal (and only issue) with the series was that he was now a 'dad'. This is weird even while several friends have now become parents.And a stuffy uptight dad at that--not a cool one who wants to give the kids the keys to the car. ""Interns"" had Mike openly worrying his daughter Eve was being exploited in the workplace. Instead of letting her decide if things in that environment are too bad, he simply wants her to quit.Honestly, I did not mind the disability references (where Mike has to self-monitor his stamina...etc). The pilot itself referenced that going to work gives a sense of empowerment for people with disabilities. I understood all of this--and very well. It spoke to me.It likely did make them a 'real person'  throughout scripts, but I  as an individual did not like seeing Mike goof up and get in his kids...etc personal business after being empowered.That's what sunk watching the show for me. Sorry."
"Loved the first season, seems to be all over the place this season, as she brings in all these random &#34;friends&#34; of hers, as if she's just giving them jobs (literally and figuratively) Mindy Kaling is a hoot, but the show is starting to lose it's shine for me. I'm aware it's a TV SHOW but, she's s dr and essentially functioning alcoholic, but still can find time to somehow be an amazing OB/GYN? There's more than one occasion where every single doc in that practice would be considered completely unable to perform the most uncomplicated delivery--they're always hung over or actively partying."
"You can tell by the way the show is no longer funny.  It's a shame, this was a great show."
"Like others, I was smitten by this show during previous seasons. The hilarity of the characters and their - albeit sometimes decidedly &#34;illogical&#34; - interactions showered viewers with chuckles, raucous laughter and, as with any good sitcom, the occasional cringe-worthy moment that makes you glad you're not experiencing whatever you're watching on the screen. I continue to feel that they should've tried harder to incorporate a long-term story line for Sara Gilbert, whose particular brand of sarcasm, sneering and condescension lent itself well as a &#34;nemesis&#34; to Jim Parson's Sheldon Cooper.I've read several comments about the supposed misogyny and sexism in the show. To some extent, I agreed but in the earlier seasons it was easy to overlook. Sure, the fact that four geeks fawn over and end up being the main social circle for a bottle-blonde waitress/aspiring actress is cliche, but there was so much well-written comedy to completely overlook that. Not anymore. Sadly, this season already starts out with yet more cliches designed to pander to what I can only imagine is a slew of viewers the fictional Dr. Sheldon Cooper was thinking of when stating, in a previous season, that stupid people make him sad.I won't post any spoilers here but I personally found the first two episodes of this season ridiculous and offensive - between the complete dilapidation of Sheldon's character to the ridiculously sexist jokes centering around Penny being a drunken idiot, women being overly emotional and men only caring about a woman's weight, to the even more ridiculously crude sexual innuendos...the show has basically lost the plot. Where there was once cerebral comedy that gave you side-splitting laughter, I sat through several episodes of this season without so much as a chuckle. Sad, but I guess inevitable - looks like the same thing that happened to Mad Men after season 4 is now happening to TBBT. It's sad that such a great cast of capable actors have been let down by such poor writing."
I watch it when nothing else is on. I would rate it with Michael J fox show and Crazy Ones it will make you laugh but its not amazing like The Millers or Modern Family those shows are way entertaining. The show is basically about a gay dude in his early 40's that has a daughter it shows the his relationship with his mother and co workers. Its marginally funny.
"What started out as a terrific and suspenseful series wound up as boring, anti government, clich&eacute; ridden drivel. With the exception of a few episodes, the entire series was a total let-down in spite of some really likeable characters- Carter, Fusco. Finch and Reese, and to a lesser degree Shaw. Root is ridiculous, even if one attempts to suspend disbelief. The acting is still good. One can only hope that series 4 improves."
A bit of let down after a great first season....in some ways becoming too much like Lost and seems to have bogged down in Texas...if it is too survive it needs to recapture the spirit of last year
"I gave this show the entire first season to get interesting - it got to the point where I was barely watching each episode.  As a sci-fi buff, I give any show which includes aliens or the future a liberal swath but really this is a kind of a &#34;gunsmoke&#34; type show with some makeup and scenery.  It's not a grabber."
"When I saw my two favorite actors in this series, I got excited.  I had planned to buy the season, but then the small voice inside said, ""watch the pilot... first.""  And I did.  And I have to say, to my dismay, the first episode was not that good.Dragging a bit in the beginning and when it came to the home invasion and seeing that two of the kidnappers were being ""nice"", I was through.Dylan McDermott's character dealing with the husband when he as all defiant, was unbelievable.  Any other kidnapper would have blown out one of his kneecaps; not show him pictures of a secret love affair he was having!  LOL  The whole thing with holding the family hostage was not convincing.I wanted to like this series, but after viewing the first episode, I really don't want to give it my money.  Not to say it was really bad or anything like that, but if I want to watch ""kind"" kidnappers, I'll watch cartoons instead.This series is not for me."
"I thought with these actors I could probably get interested but I just can't take a show seriously that hinges on something bad happening to the president.....wait, I'm sorry, in a dramatic voice, ""The President of the United States"". I tried to focus on the characters (I love Colette) but just kept feeling insulted. All that activity and effort for such a thing is too silly. Similar in a way to that show about the serial killer, ""The Following"" in that the bad guys are seemingly everywhere except as unlikely as that premise is at least they tried to make it interesting. This one is just, ""oh no, the president!"" Boring."
"The first four season were outrageous. I waited on pins and needles for the next episode, the next glimpse of what might happen, the next bit of news. Season Five? Not so much. If there's a Season Six?  Nuh. Uh.  Right now I won't give specifics for fear of spoiling, but I will say that the writers looked for scape goats and found lame ones. Goats that fly even more badly than pigs do in a fantasy series.  Sorry, guys.If I could reach through your screen I'd grab your lapels and shout, &#34;Don't do it, man! Don't do it!!&#34;"
"This used to be a compelling program featuring engaging characters. However, by the fifth season, the series  featured very few original ideas. The characters became far more  cartoon like and considerably less enjoyable. There was none of the charm that made the first few years so enjoyable.Pass the later years by .... Re watch the earlier episodes..."
"Amazon won't let me review individual episodes.Here is an update:I cancelled after midrun in the fifth season - it just got stupid.Catherine is back, yet again, Damon IS a VAMPIRE and everyone chides him for being one,I found him a lot more interesting than Steffen with his Bunny diet.After 5 years I have had enough of Cat and the love triangle.( I was cheering too, for her to die, finally!)Maybe that is what the teenies want, it's okay - after all it was written for them, but I can't deal with this neverending soap anymore!Everyone is on damons case for being a vampire ,yet vampires is what this show is based on.He is the closest thing to being one on this show - the way this is going I would rather watch Bunnicula .That seems to be what the audience wants.I feel sorry for the actors, they are Great, they are believable, do what they are told,are really,really good at it, but the writers are dropping the ball."
"Last season this series began to take a bad turn when it resorted to sick levels of violence for nothing more than shock value. This season they seem to be employing a scorched earth policy as for as their characters and any redeeming values they might have left. Over these many seasons there has been a consistent theme that the Max Teller character was the flawed yet somewhat noble protagonist of the story. After episode two of this season I can say that he is just another morally and ethically bankrupt character that deserves whatever blizzard fate that SUTTER can think up for him. When there are no longer any characters that an audience can identify with or root for, it's time to wrap it up an close the book on S O A.When does JUSTIFIED come back ?After watching the final episode ...... W T F ?  In the scope of th  storyline (what storyline there was), killing off that character, in some blizzard way, made sense. However the way they chose to do it is so implausible that it takes away any shred of believability.  In what direction could this show possibly go in another season ?"
by season six this has become the silliest series that I have ever seen. Not worth the money and I regret buying it. I know that this is a personal preference and others might disagree but the writers apparently ran out of things to  get the actors to do. It just became stupid. I would skip this season and have fond memories of seasons one through five.
This used to be my favorite program.  Now it's become a soap opera mostly centering around the female characters.  I actually got up and brushed my teeth during episode 9.  Borrrrring.
Watched the SOA sense the beginning and the first episode this season was like a race to be disturbing and plain sick.  No plot completely void of good writing and simple disappointing.  It was almost as bad as a porn flick.  Ironic and you'll understand if you buy it.  How did I unsubscribe to the weekly purchase?  Kill this series FX and go find something worth watching.  Sorry any real lover of SOA that is a critic of good drama has to agree this years opener went over like a turd in a punch bowl.
"i've watched 3 episodes of this season. Don't care for it anymore.  the violence is unrelenting, the attitudes towards wen are more and more caveman like. I don't like the Vato angle, though Jimmy Smits is great, and I am not huge fan of his. I dunno... once Opie died and Otto bit off his tongue, i think that was the end for me. The violence doesn't seem to have a point, it just seems to be for the glorious sake of violence. Otto being sodomized doesn't further the storyline. and Jax screwing the madam takes away his last remaining redeeming feature: his loyalty to Tara. Sorry, but you lost this watcher."
"So far not liking this season any more than the 8th season.  Come on SPN writers let's get back to what made this show great for seven seasons.  Please stop with the stupid hunter characters and bring back Garth.  Please write Kevin's character better and please don't turn Crowley into a good guy.  Please find a great female counterpart for Dean, I miss Dean with women.  Stop with the heavy handed Bromance and bring back Castiel.  Also the bunker is okay but its not cool and if you've forgotten this is a show about the dark and creepy; about two guys on the road, not in a bunker.  Kind of tired of sorry, whiny, non cool angels, and that included Zeke.You had a cool concept the men of letters, something destroyed them, why? not that would be a great plot point and could really drive the mythos forward.  Please don't let this show go out like this."
"I bought a season pass to this by accident, and I am very sorry I did. The nicest thing I can say about this show is that it's marginally better than Agents of Shield. It's too bad really, because it has a good cast and I do like how they are trying to tell two stories at the same time, but the script writing and editing are lacking in continuity and common sense, and all the characters have the emotional maturity of eight year olds.I get that I'm not the target demographic for this show, but I'd like to think teenagers don't appreciate gaping plot holes and senseless melodrama either. :p"
"it says COMPLETE 2nd season, if that's true then how come when I go on to hulu plus they have new season 2 episodes that amazons so called &#34;complete&#34; season DOES NOT HAVE!!!! IT IS NOT COMPLETE IT DOES NOT HAVE ALL THE EPISODES OF THE SEASONAMAZON PLEASE STOP LYING SO MUCH!!!!!!"
"Pass this stinkeroo by.I have watched the first half of  Season One.I kept expecting the characters to ""gel"". I kept  expecting the plot to start making sense.Then, I just realized that this was a train wreck that would never get better.I really wanted to like this Series.I really do not.The  original premise had incredible potential..series has some of the worst writing of any series on Network tv this season.Every episode has the most preposterous plot points - even for a ""sci fi"" type  program.It is very difficult to develop empathy for any of the characters.  They appear to ""pose"" through every scene.None of the characters are the least bit engaging or realistic.Better to just pass on this one - don't waste your time."
"Aimed at a teenage audience that wants the wish fulfillment of having powers and being special and joining a tribe.  Not science fiction at all and the human story isn't anything I can relate to either.  For it's audience I'm sure it's fine, but not for me."
I never got to see it.  I don't know what night it is on.  End of the story.  I am done.
"Had great potential for the plot, but got boring and predictable after the third episode. The robot guy is attractive but got old. Not engaging enough."
"Solid story line with great ideas and FX, but a little too cute and cheesy. I hope they go for a more series tone and a more serial episode ladder. The all in one episodes that don't relate to each other bring the entire series down a few notches. They need to d something like 24 or X files, Game of Thrones. I doubt they will, but it could work well. The characters are too shallow also. It's a little like a modern Hawaii Five-0: ""Bookem DanoBot!""Update:So sadly, this doesn't measure. In the last episode, a stake out has the star chasing the villain, and he runs out of ammo. That might not be so bad if the firefight goes on for any length of time, but it was the first load out in the pistol. So, let me guess, cops don't carry reloads? Shallow, rubbish writing for the child minded.Ages: 6-10"
I did not see &#34;The Complete First Season&#34; of Almost Human. I only saw a trailer-so I cannot fairly or fully assess the show. It looks &#34;okay&#34; and I'll give it a shot. Perhaps you should too.
"I did not like the 1st episode but a preview Documentary not the show, if the 1st show comes out, I then will view it and give a better rating next time."
"Derivative in the worst way, with a low budget look, cliche acting, and lazy editing. Wanted it to be good but....."
"With an actress like Allison Janney, I expected a quality TV program. After following her Mom's (Allison Janney) example, Anna Fans plays a daughter who spent her life drinking and in dead end relationships. Fans is trying to turn her like around and is now sober and attending AA. .Although Fans isn't drinking, little else has changed in her life.. She has an affair with her married boss who is the manager where she works as a waitress - a job she hates. Examples of the pathetic jokes including Fan telling her own daughter she cannot tell her not to smoke pot or drink because that was her quote in her high school year book and calling Janney's date her &#34;new Dad&#34;."
"Hate it. French Stewart is the only redeeming factor here. I love Allison Janney, but I'd as soon forget she's in this bomb. Dreadful."
"I am a huge Alison Janney fan, and even though I really haven't liked every movie I saw Anna Farris in, I always thought she was good in them. So when I saw a preview for this show, I really wanted to see it. Even though Alison Janney is good in it sometimes, Anna Farris can be really cheesy in the show sometimes. And the 20-second laugh track after everything they say makes it worse. But it's Chuck Lorre, so it's not surprising."
"Werewolves, Vampires and Witches, Oh ! NO !Take all of these and cross it with the &#34;Young and the Restless&#34; and you have !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&#34;The Unoriginals,..  A show about a French City where no one speaks French ?Teen Drama is so undramatic.This is one of those shows that starts out really interesting and exciting, and then,...just like &#34;Lost &#34; and many others,..the writers run out of material, and try to wing it until the end of the season. Well End it !Just so you all know,  Most of the people in Louisiana are laughing at this show !It is like taking one of the oldest cities in the world, and making Smurfs as the cast.Give it up,..end it already !"
This series is not as appealing to me as The Vampire Diaries.  That is the only reason why I have cancelled my series purchase.
"While still my family's favorite series for &#34;family time&#34;, This episode did not live up to the quality of past episodes. I look forward to watching better story lines in the show and I hope this hiccup was only temporary because I believe my entire family has come to expect an exceptional 45 minutes of riveting zombie AKA: walkers action!"
"Along with the last episode, there is far, far too much weight given to the bad guy. Yeah we get it. He's a sociopath murderer who gets off on power and murdering. Yeah, we get it, he manipulates people to his own end, like sociopaths do. Yeah, we get it, he wants to kill all of Rick's crew because they got over on him. Yeah, we get it, he doesn't kill to protect, that's his self delusion that justifies his serial and mass murdering sprees.It's almost like the writers have a fascination with the sociopath mind. Perhaps it's a kind of hero worship for them. Actually, it's an indication they are relying on cheap emotional thrills rather than good, solid writing. You can tell when writers have nothing else to give: They keep repeating the same old thing in a little different way to get cheap emotional thrills from viewers, hoping they will return for, yes, more cheap emotional thrills.How many times will the bad guy come back? How many more innocent good people will he murder? How many more people will he torture? How many more women will he rape? Yawn, ad infinitum.Episode Pros: Sociopath murderer kills other sociopath murderer. +1Episode cons: New sociopath murderer introduced to take the place of the old sociopath murderer, Martinez. Net sociopath gain/loss: 0New ideas: noneInteresting dilemmas: none.Good strategies: none.Philosophical dialog: none.Relation to real life problems: none.Net overall literary value: NONE!"
"This season is not  so exciting as the other seasons. I don't feel the same vibe on the caracthers, or maybe it is just the fact that they do not work well separately. Yes, they all got separated after the prison fell down, it is amazing to think that they would not have a few encounter points for that kind of a mess, or a safe house as per say; where they could meet and regroup or just leave a note to where they are trying to get headed.I know it is all volatile, but come on, there are so many places...I just hope they get reunited soon because it is all boring so far!"

"not that entertaining.  Taking place at a teen party, the film centers around a time warp and doubles enter of another enter in."
"I have to say that based on the pilot episode this show is just not one for me.  I am usually a fan of this genre and have been known to enjoy shows that border on the high end of the cheese scale, but even for me this was one step too farThe initial episode was confusing, and, for me, badly put together.  The decision to set the first 5 minutes the way they were left me feeling like I had missed an episode (I checked and I have not).  The acting was pretty woeful, and what was being branded as suspense just seemed sillyPerhaps this show improved with further episodes.  I don't know if thats the case or not, but I will not be giving it another chance"
"Nah, not a good year.  No drama.  Similar challenges.  Padma has lost her charm and Tom seems held back.  It's time to pack it in and move on. The whole show has simply gotten boring -- like most repeat season cooking shows.  We need something new."
If a chef disagrees with the judges - the judges hold grudges and get rid of them.  It is a very biased show and based on that not very enjoyable to watch.
"I cant condone killing shellfish - it is so cruel.  But this season had a lot of good personalities. I thought Roy Choy was a total dirtbag. But Emetil, Tom, and Padma were cool. I was rooting for Nina or Shirley, but the jerk rudeboy took home the prize. Oh well. Guess he can be a jerk at his new restaurant now."
"Hello Writers stop the stupidity !!!  Please do not JUMP THE SHARK ....Austin from Houston is 183 miles unless you are driving 90 miles an hour you are not 2 hours away.  Other junk about the wellsite was just too stupid for words.  But the entire lighting the water faucet what an absurdity.  Please do not ruin this series - has been a bit of fun for me each week !Earlier, in 'Golden Hammer' was bad enough looking at the landscape photos where actual hills were portrayed in Houston.  HILLS????? really ??  , however, one can bypass that part as not significant to the story line."
"Specifically to the Episode &#34;Fire and Brimstone&#34;:  Amazon has lost the licensing agreement to play this episode?  Unbelievable!  This type of snafu is unacceptable to consumers/viewers and subscribers who have paid good money to view one of their favorite shows.  Get your act together, Amazon, and bring back The Mentalist!"
"Cliched lame-o ending. Its a onspiracy! Oh wait, its a onspiracy but I killed my coconspirators, faked my fear of heights, and decided to give you time o be saved by bragging about my evil plan instead of killing you once you made me."
"While I appreciate there is such a thing as editing in the world of Food Network, this show should be renamed (Potential) Germs Wanted. These chefs were shown touching their mouths, noses, underarms and ears and then touching food. Again, I have no idea what the timing was because I obviously was not there, but at one point one of the female chefs put her hand under her arm and then picked up a dish and handed it to another chef. This does not even include when Anne chastised a male chef for profusely sweating in the food he was preparing. This is why I do not eat out. Disgusting."
This show was a little too bizarre for me. If this woman was actually able to speak with the spirit world then why in the world wouldn't she simply ask the people coming out of the walls how they got there or speak with the children about how they died. Her detective partner did more work by visiting the local library and the neighbors then she did by standing in the basement making guesses and explaining she doesn't feel well.
"do not necessarily make for an informative show.  It seems more like yet another vanity reality show...me, me, me...it's all about me.  I think we have reached the critical mass of reality shows masquerading as being useful or helpful. If these guys and others like them want to help, fine, let them do so.  But we don't need to hear or see them do it. Do your work and leave us alone!"
I used to enjoy Anthony Bourdain but now he has become like a re run of himself but in a different place.
"Absolutely nothing happens for most shows except the boys scare each other in a dark spooky place. Sometimes  for a little comedy relief they put the one with the goatee in jeopardy from some unseen force. After an escapist hour, you feel your intellect has become something paranormal. You've lost the will to live. You question your very existence, let alone -- do ghosts exist? But just like watching a clown car accident on the freeway your eyes are drawn to the carnage."
"I am getting very bored of found footage movies based on a true story about missing people the police have yet to find.  This is nothing special nor did I find it interesting.  A girl, her boyfriend and her cousin go camping.  They have a camera and the boyfriend likes to film everything.  So the camera moves a lot, the movie goes from color to grayscale at night.  Someone/Something mysterious is harassing them in the woods and naturally they get separated.  Each one is paranoid/scared of the other because something has happened to him.  **yawn** there is more running around in the dark...so the camera shows a lot of leaves, vines, tree bark, grass, rock, tree branches, some scenes of the back of legs running.  The camera goes dark when a confrontation is taking place so the viewer is left in the dark **yawn** I am assuming this is suppose to build suspense but it has been overdone in so many other films there is nothing new.  More running camera with more images of tree limbs, leaves, grass and rock.  Another confrontation takes place and the camera goes dark **yawn** leaving viewer in the dark again.  Then the film ends with a little note that the campers were never found.  Oh, the movie opens with the words based on a true story.  I don't know how much is true.  I wasn't impressed with the movie.  The movie is slow and lacks originality.  I gave it two stars simply because the acting was descent.  Aside from that I would rather watch the Blair Witch Project."
"He's a video voyeur, she's deceitful, he's a 3rd wheel and together they're....unsympathetic.  He's arrogant, she's snotty, he's a tool and together they're... obnoxious.  He's gone, she's hysterical, he's psychotic and together they're...spineless.So just to recap, we have a cast of characters that are: unsympathetic, obnoxious, spineless and in survival horror if the victims suck the killer at least has to be interesting but ""A Night in the Woods"" gives us neither; just 83 minutes of found footage dramarama and the possibility that there MIGHT be something insidious lurking in a woods that's in desperate need of the forest equivalent of propecia.  :("
"I didn't like it the first time I watched the series. I changed my mind and watched the show back to back. It has its moments of stupidity, but I liked it. It just got to the point where it was too stupid to keep my attention. I had to give up on it. I liked other seasons."
"It was bound to happen sooner or later, writers running out of ideas (or just getting lazy), actors ensconced in their established roles (or just getting lazy), there's no mystery anymore, and bringing in the old &#34;tried and true&#34; dramatic scenarios shows a complete lack of creativity  (i.e., having Ryan's wife giving birth in an ambulance at the scene of a fire, come on!) That's all."
"The Castle character is still all about himself with no concern for endangering Beckett's career with his immature antics. Maybe the writers could get rid of his character and transition the novels and working with NYPD to Alexis. The relationship between Alexis and Beckett would be enough. OR, it will be the same up and down on and off between Castle and Beckett.  This seems to be about smart women making stupid choices: how long will Beckett keep babysitting the American male ... the Scotland Yard guy was a better match.Episode 3: So, we saw it coming, I trust - FEDERAL means FEDERAL. The job was the right move, if nothing esle to show Kate what it would be like and the freedoms that would be compromised by hitting the national scene. The career investment in major cities like New York and Los Angeles is hard to leave behind, especially with coworkers, friends, and family there as well. Washington is a unique mix in the scheme of things and so is the FBI."
"The writers have ruined this show! or just ran out of ideas to make it interesting. I used to be a huge fan of the first and second seasons, then came third season and my fondness just jumped out of the window. Where's the magic? Where's the humour? I think the creators of the show has swayed from it's original premise that now it became a shell of it's old self.The plot lines are so ridiculous and utterly boring this season they just make me have ADD. Max going to pastry school that the 2 broke girls can't afford as usual, but Caroline offers to work in exchange for the incredible sum of fees! She never does any working, instead falls head over heels with Chef Nicolas the owner of the pastry school who happens to be married, almost all episodes out so far are dedicated to their interaction; I can sum it up in a couple of sentences;Caroline: Chef Nicolas you're so hot but you're also married I can never date a married man! Chef Nicolas: It's okay, me and my wife have an open marriage we can sleep with whoever we want to, besides she's in France *stereotypical much* Caroline: NO, I shall not sleep with you even if I want to! Leave your wife first. Chef Nicolas: Okay, I'll break up with her if that means having a chance with you even though I don't really know you that well.. Caroline: You can't break up with your wife! I can't ruin your marriage.Boring or what? If you think Caroline's romantic interest was repetitive then Max's even worse! She's dating Deke a guy from her pastry class who's a billionaire and lives in a dumpster? Cause he's a hippie? and they too broke up because Max couldn't handle the fact that her boyfriend is a rich person even though she's been friends with Caroline who used to be rich and worked as a baby sitter for a Rich Manhattan socialist in season one? Cut me a slack! Drama for the sake of drama...That is what this season has been about so far, no more concern about making it into the cupcake business there's very little focus on the business that'll supposedly make them rich. The majority of the show is focused on their boring romances. Oleg, Sophie, Han and Earl all these loveable supporting characters are somehow forgotten in the process and no longer have enough screen play. The jokes are no longer funny just obnoxious! The girls seem irritating this season and their boyfriends even more so.2 broke girls was a show that was funny! Yes, it was blunt and ridiculous to a degree but I enjoyed it! I loved what the premise was about. It was about building a dream out of scratch and it was hilarious because they would fail multiple times but that never stopped them. Now, it's just not what it used to be.Bring back the heart and soul of the show cause this season just seems formulaic, unfortunately this is no longer a weekly watch for me."
"To put it shortly Season 1 was great. The story was fresh, the dynamics between the characters were interesting, the photography was gorgeous and to back it all up with had this tale and storyline of a woman attempting revenge on her father's ex employee who framed him for a crime he didn't commit. Splendid! You could almost feel the essence of the story it did seem like a classic tale however this series unfortunately has extended itself too long and over welcomed it's stay.What was once a thrilling story of seeking justice, double crossing, plotting and betrayal is now nothing but an over exaggerated, melodramatic and annoying scene after scene of muffled twists and turns. Too many things are thrown at us it's hard to keep track of what exactly is going on. Too much of something is really not that good and sometimes simplicity is key!It's one thing to create a masterful logic complicated plot, to keep things interesting however it's a completely another matter to hoard this plot to death! The purpose of Emily's ever existence in the lives of the Graysons was to seek revenge and that idea although persistent and toyed with is no longer the spotlight of the series I'm afraid.A plot about revenge is never intended to take this long, this story would've made much more sense and would've been fantastic if it was introduced as a mini series of 10 episodes per season instead of a full on show. Much less complications and far more superior writing. If we were to crop out all the unnecessary details and uncalled for twists and turns we would've ended summing up the whole 3 seasons to a 2 hour movie. That's just how much contrived scenarios are being shoved down our throat. Of course the viewer can't help but watch out of curiosity for what's going to happen next and how this whole endeavour is going to finally end, but that doesn't make the journey pleasing in fact it's very painful to watch.And don't even get me started on the latest twist from the latest episode, after making us set through three seasons the writers want to punish us by telling us that the cause of the series was a false one to begin with! It's almost like they just made that up last minute to get people to watch the following season because they know that everyone is getting bored with this show. I hate how the characters end up getting ADD or going through constant Bipolar sessions. It's almost like no one is ever certain of who they are and yes it is confusing and stolen from a million dozen storylines made before hand! The writing is just lazy.If you're going to ever watch this show then don't watch it pass the first season and second season. The third season is just a claustrophobic disaster."
"I've been debating what I thought about this film since it finished a few moments ago. It's not your average film, and so much of it was puzzling, bizarre, weird and cool. However what I think has lead me to give it 2 stars is analyzing all the bots and pieces.First I asked myself why did I watch it? Well the trailer was interesting, it was in black and white, but modern, and looked like it was going to have some cool visual effects like Disneyland was going to be blown up. So it grabbed my attention fast, but what I actually got was not what I expected. It's not horror, and borderlines on creepy to weird, depending on if you are scared by your own shadow, or like me and nothing scares you. S it loses a point in lying to me in the trailer that this was going to deliver what I expected it to, destruction in Disneyland and cool visual effects. They are too few in this movie overall and nothing was really seen that wasn't in the trailer.Secondly I was fooled by all the review headlines on the cover like this movie should not exist, and what not. I thought someone was making a horror film in Disneyland or somewhat exposing the way Disney keep deaths in the park hush hush and secretive... but not, it turns out to be more of a drunk guys acid trip. So minus another star.The acting is not that bad, and the filming is OK. However could you walk away quoting something from this film or really remember a stand out performance or scene in itself? No, not really, I don't think many people will either.I think amongst the captivating weirdness and bizarre things going on, I was also being driven to keep watching wondering how they managed to film this thing? Did they actually do it in Disneyland, is it blue-screen effect with composted in the background, or was it a secret filming they did without Disneyland Florida's permission? But once the film was over, I asked myself two things.Did I enjoy the movie? Well, some parts where OK, but by the time it ended and answered a question I was wondering, I thought, no, it's not a masterpeice. Some people really think art house is making a film in black and white these days, and I really can not emphasize just how stupid I think that sort of thinking is. If you had a black and white TV, it still wouldn't make Survivor worthy of watching or call must see tv, so who cares if this thing is shot in B&W; or not? Some shots did remind me of the old b&w; days of television (seeing reruns of coarse) but just because you can shoot a few scenes with that nostalgia feel doesn't mean the film is overall a work of art. It's just reusing something used many, many, many years ago. Adding cgi into it is not original either.So coming away from the film, I asked myself the ultimate question. Would I watch it again? And the answer is no. Its not a gripping story, it's just something so weird you can sit through it the first time, but to watch it again isn't going to be like re-watching Back To The Future where you seem to always spot or pick up on something you missed before. This film is just not up there in that kind of great film making. So how can it possibly be a 5 star movie? Shouldn't that be reserved for movies so great you can watch them over and over and over again, and not just once, like this one?Overall i'm in limbo to vote it somewhere between 2 and 3 stars. I don't hate it, but I don't like it, it's in between somewhere as my feelings kept rocking up and down all the way through the film as it steered in one direction, then for no reason went another, and then reveals this and that, but in the end... it wasn't clever. I see right through the tricks people have applauded this movie for. I can't urge them enough to get out and see more movies, and not just find a turd like this one, pick it up and say, &#34;Oh, it smells ....different, therefor it must be special!&#34;... still, how much can you sell a fresh turd for on eBay?"
"Like others have posted the only thing clever about this movie was the use of Guerrilla filmmaking without Disney's permission.  It is such a shame that they wasted it on this piece of shlock.  The idea of shooting a film on Disney's property was such a great idea and as a huge fan of Disney Parks and resorts I was really looking forward to this film.  So you can imagine my disappointment when they wasted this opportunity on something that literally had no story and made absolutely no sense.  In fact I will go as far as saying they probably didn't have a story and they were just making it up as they went along.  I heard this was supposed to be a horror film, but because it was such a mess it would be hard to put it in any particular genre it seemed more like a black comedy to me but it really falls short no matter how it will be categorized.  It reminded me of the movie Eraserhead where it was just someone's nightmare and the interpretation was up to the viewer.  Now if you found you liked David Lynch's movie Eraserhead, you might very well think this is a masterpiece.  Having said that I am not a fan of that movie and I am not a fan of David Lynch type of surrealism.  I'm simply not a fan of being able to make a movie and not have any plot whatsoever to follow and therefore, no story or ending.  So in closing this review, if you like David Lynch, particularly Eraserhead, you might look at this as a masterpiece.  I think both movies are crap, so take this review from where it is coming from.  I gave them two stars for the guerilla filmmaking and that is where my appreciation of this movie ends."
"Director Randy Moore filmed Escape from Tomorrow entirely at the Disney World and Disneyland theme parks. As he did not have permission to do so, he used meticulously planned guerrilla tactics in order to shoot the film without being caught. The actors kept the script on their iPhones. The crew used handheld cameras and dressed as park visitors. Scenes were blocked and rehearsed several times in hotel rooms before shooting, and dialogue was recorded using digital devices which were taped to the actors. The film was also shot in monochrome, in order to avoid lighting issues. No one ever suspected the cast or crew of foul play. In this respect, Escape from Tomorrow is an incredibly risky one of a kind achievement. Randy Moore was afraid that Disney would find out about his little experiment, and so he edited the film in South Korea. The film was released at Sundance, and word of mouth spread quickly.Ultimately, the unorthodox history behind the making of the film would prove to be far interesting than the film itself.Escape from Tomorrow tells the story of Jim White, who finds out that he has lost his job on the last day of his family vacation at Disney World. He decides to keep it to himself, so that his wife, his son, and daughter can have a fun time without all of the drama. As he and his family ride the monorail to the park, Jim catches sight of two young Parisian girls &#8211; two little Lolita&#8217;s that he will soon become obsessed with. Make no mistake, Jim is a disturbed man. While riding the &#8220;Small World&#8221; attraction, Jim begins to hallucinate. The cherub-faced animatronics begin to grow fangs, smiling evilly at Jim as he passes by. Later, Jim catches sight of the Parisian girls once again, and follows them to Space Mountain, where he forces his son to ride. After the kid gets motion sickness, Jim&#8217;s wife chastises him, and she takes the boy back to the hotel to recover. Jim takes his daughter to the Magic Kingdom, where the son of a creepy wheel-chair bound man pushes her to the ground, scraping her knee. Jim takes her to the nurse, who seems to be a bit disturbed and warns Jim of a mysterious &#8220;cat flu&#8221; that is going around the park. &#8220;You can be a host and not even know it,&#8221; she says.For the rest of the day, Jim will continue to follow the Parisian girls, he will fall under the spell of an ex-Disney princess who is now an evil queen, and he will learn that the majority of the ever-smiling Disney Princesses at the park are actually expensive hookers who sell themselves to rich Japanese businessmen, while also becoming the target of an evil plot at Epcot&#8217;s Spaceship Earth which will purge him of his vivid imagination. Hallucinatory images are sprinkled throughout to give the film a surreal Lynchian feel, but these moments are fleeting &#8211; which is upsetting, because these are perhaps the most involving sequences in the film, as the bulk of the running time is dedicated to Jim&#8217;s tireless pursuit of those darned Parisian girls. These scenes are repetitive and dull &#8211; and honestly, Jim is a poorly written character. After a while, I was ready to get away from him.And then there&#8217;s the &#8220;cat flu&#8221; sequence, which brought back memories of a certain toilet scene from Dumb and Dumber. After a few more slightly trippy scenes, the film ends in a bizarre fashion that doesn&#8217;t quite work, not even in the realm of avant-garde cinema. The trailer for Escape from Tomorrow would have you believe that this is one of the greatest films ever made, a psychedelic wonder the likes of which you have never seen before. At the end of the day, all that it really offers is weak social commentary on the inherent creepiness behind family theme parks, featuring the shenanigans of a Lester Burnham wannabe. The one saving grace in Escape from Tomorrow comes in the form of Abel Korzeniowski&#8217;s beautiful score.I wanted to love this film. I really did. While there are some clever moments here, they never really add up to much. I wanted this film to take me to new heights, to restore my faith in the medium. It didn&#8217;t do any of those things. In fact, it&#8217;s all painfully, unforgivably ordinary."
"I first heard about ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW in a short article in ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY in the fall of 2013. After reading the article, it made me really eager to see the film: a movie that was secretly filmed at Disney&#8217;s amusement parks without their permission?! The movie is now available on DVD and recently I was able to finally watch it.Although it was secretly filmed at both Disney World and Disneyland, ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW is set at Disney World. The film centers around the character of Jim (Roy Abramsohm). Jim White and his family are on their last day of vacation at the &#8220;most magical place on Earth.&#8221; His wife and kids are getting dressed and ready for the day when Jim receives a telephone call from his boss informing him that he is fired. Jim is upset by the news, but decides not to tell his wife or kids anything because he doesn&#8217;t want to spoil their trip. While on the patio talking to his boss, Jim notices a strange white van below that is seen later on again in the movie. While on the patio, Jim&#8217;s son, Elliot (Jack Dalton) locks him out of the hotel room. These minor events foreshadow terrible things to happen later in the movie and it quickly becomes apparent that although they might appear like a typical American family, there are some serious issues with Jim&#8217;s family. Jim&#8217;s wife is domineering and berates her husband as though he is a tv sitcom dad. Jim, on the other hand, is clearly looking for some excitement in his life and his wandering eye catches the figure of two barely-teenage French girls. At least one of them seem infatuated by his gazes and Jim ends up following them throughout the park. As the movie progresses, it becomes more and more difficult to figure out exactly what is going on. The viewer isn&#8217;t sure if the things Jim sees are real or part of his imagination. They don&#8217;t know if Jim is on some kind of drugs, is just imagining, or is being mentally affected by a disease in his brain. The Small World creatures turn into horrific little imps with teeth, a person is beheaded, there&#8217;s a terrible terminal disease called Cat Flu that&#8217;s going around the park, and Jim is seduced (and maybe drugged) by a former Disney character princess. All the while the French girls come and go in so many places that it can&#8217;t possibly be coincidence. Viewers also discover that the Disney character princess are actually high-class hookers for Asian businessmen, that food that&#8217;s sold as turkey legs are actually emu legs, and that Epcot and the rest of the Disney parks are just one massive experiment in human social engineering.In terms of film making and cinematic achievement, ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW is notable for the guerilla-way that the movie was made. Although the movie is set at Disney parks, Disney had no association with the movie, The cast and crew dressed in tourist clothes, the cast&#8217;s scripts were available only through their smart phones, and sometimes the cast went through the same ride almost thirty times in one day. The director became so paranoid that the movie might be discovered by Disney before it was finished that he went to South Korea to edit it so there would be no leaks. It is a testament to the director&#8217;s skill and passion that the movie even exists.With that said, ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW is a terrible movie. The movie is marketed as a horror movie, but the only real horror of the film is its absurdity and nonsensicality. Jim spends the majority of his time in the film chasing around two barely-teenage French girls with the determination of a creeper out of a snuff film. There&#8217;s no explanation of who these girls are, what their purpose is, and why they are featured so much. The acting isn&#8217;t terrible, but (other than Jim&#8217;s daughter) there isn&#8217;t a character in the movie that is likeable. For instance, Jim is the central figure of the film but he&#8217;s not really a very likeable person: he stalks the French girls through the park like a crazy creeper, he yells at another creepy man on a scooter for no real apparent reason, he commits adultery while his daughter sleeps in the next room, and he never once compliments his wife. There is definitely some marital conflict between Jim and his wife, but the movie never addresses it and instead, like the news of his firing, it&#8217;s just not mentioned. Jim is kidnapped by a robot scientist, but it&#8217;s never made clear exactly what Jim was supposed to have done or what his part in this grand experiment was. There&#8217;s been some comparisons of ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW to David Lynch movies. There is a similar vibe there, but as weird as his projects often are, most Lynch movies at least have a discernible narrative that can be followed. There really is no narrative in ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW. After I finished watching the movie, I thought to myself, &#8220;What a waste.&#8221;ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW will always be remembered as a side note (the movie made at Disney that Disney didn&#8217;t know about) instead of the actual movie itself. As a movie, it&#8217;s an absurdist nightmare that lacks any real meaning and coherence."
"This started off as a good follow-up to the first season, and after a while the show just got too esoteric and the characters too whiney. Things just got on my nerves and the show is now more frustrating than entertaining. Everyone complains instead of solving problems on the show. Bleck."
"If the creators of Reign intended to make a historical drama with a target audience of teenage girls, then I would consider this pilot moderately succesfull.  If they were hoping to draw in a larger audience than that, then they have failed in a big way. The script for Reign, while tecknicly good, fails to show any real oridganality, and the acting is barely mediocre. The charicters just don't 'feel' mideville-- the young wemen come across like modern chearleaders and the male leads come across like highschool jocks. And the anackronisms! I'm sure that french castles in the fifteen hundreds all had large plate glass windows and that the young wemen wore dresses that would be great for a prom. And was that an asfault pavement I saw?If your looking for Game of Throwns, give this one a pass."
"This show is very entertaining. HOWEVER, IF you like ""historical"" shows you will HATE this one because it goes so FAR OFF the mark of factual events of that time to such a point that its a laughable joke. First of all King Henry, didn't have a bastard and/or mistress who lived in the castle (which in that time would of never happen), and in REAL history: Mary married Francis once arrived in France; Francis did die around 5 years after their marriage and she remarried in Scotland to rule. She was executed years later by Queen Elizabeth for plotting her assignation. Queen Mary of Scots was NOT this sweet innocent girl they make her out to be in real life. This show goes against everything people of that era believed in. They put 21st century humans with 21st century liberal beliefs in this TV show. This show would of been better if they ""made up fictional characters"" (like in the Game of Thrones) and it would of been accepted and just as popular. I give it 2 stars because, even though I am ""entertained"" by it; I strongly dislike the writers/creators of this show who completely circumvent and PERVERT historical facts. Also, SOUNDTRACK ISSUES: the ""teenage"" pop music might be ""ok"" in selected scenes but it's overkill. In most cases, the soundtrack it doesn't fit. It's like listening to Brittany Spears in really violent horror show (ex. SAW 2, Hostel, etc). LOL! You'll get a good laugh!"
"Sorry....Im a fanatic for all period pieces series and movies...O>M>G>~~~watched the first episode...its okay if your naive, romantically starved, or a teenager and your idea of true love and history is the TWILIGHT saga....really...Costumes were a bit over the top,something Calvin Klein designed for everyone....the teenage girls hair...come on....no one spoke that way, women didnt wear their hair like that yet...the makeup...the teenage pajama parties.....Really?THEYRE ALL SO BEAUTIFUL!!!!! my goodness....Like I said...if you're very young, a new viewer to period drama, or just like watching perfect bosoms and cut young dudes run around, or just ""in love with love""..Go ahead enjoy...Nothing wrong with that, ever.......BUT, if you want to view a piece worthwhile view Elizabeth with Anne-marie Duff, from BBC...or last years Vikings from the History channel....even Duchess, the movie.M.P.P.script: THEY SHOULD HAVE STAYED ""BEHIND THE THRONE""..FOR TEENAGE VIEWING ONLY."
"How revelatory must a film truly be to include the director&#8217;s name above the picture&#8217;s title?  I suppose the answer will always be, &#8220;That depends on the director.&#8221;  For example, I can&#8217;t imagine that there are crowds of anxious movie-goers lined up anticipating WOODY ALLEN&#8217;S DRACULA.  Granted, the kids might pour out in droves for MICHAEL BAY&#8217;S DRACULA.  Maybe you could interest most of middle-class America to pony up their ten bucks a-piece on STEVEN SPIELBERG&#8217;S DRACULA.  Such is life.For those who know the name Dario Argento, I&#8217;d imagine ARGENTO&#8217;S DRACULA might have particular significance.  Indeed, Argento has a fan-base of impressive proportions amongst cinema aficionados and horror buffs, but, outside of those two groups, is he a household name?  That was probably a question producers were asking in late 2013 when this film was released merely as DRACULA 3D; it largely went unattended in the marketplace, which caused them to drop the whole three-D thing and just emphasize the &#8216;Argento&#8217; in the new DVD release.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Jonathan Harker (played by Unax Ugalde) is summoned to the castle of the Count Dracula (an impressive Thomas Kretschmann) where he&#8217;s to begin work as the resident librarian, cataloguing all of his employer&#8217;s expansive book collection.  However, once Harker seems to have vanished, his lovely wife Mina (a pleasingly attractive Marta Gastini) follows in his footsteps, seeking to uncover the truth of her love&#8217;s disappearance.  Before all is said and done, she&#8217;ll require the services of Abraham Van Helsing (the ever-reliable Rutger Hauer) to bring about an end to a vile agreement between Dracula and the townspeople he&#8217;s duped into subservience.I haven&#8217;t read Bram Stoker&#8217;s classic novel (it&#8217;s on my bucket list), so I couldn&#8217;t say how faithful ARGENTO&#8217;S DRACULA remains to STOKER&#8217;S DRACULA.  I can say that the story certainly feels as if some minor effort went into capturing this tale as an effective but low-budget period production.  Everything &#8220;looks&#8221; old age, but, by that same barometer, everyone &#8220;looks&#8221; like they&#8217;re acting, too.  For my tastes, Argento&#8217;s work is staged and photographed far too passively to evoke the legitimately lurid sensibilities only effectively hinted at in a few key scenes, and, sadly, there&#8217;s just an awful lot of bloat to this work.  At nearly two hours, this version of the immortal bloodsucker is arguably thirty minutes too long.There&#8217;s far too much set-up required in the tale as told, scripted by Argento and Antonio Tentori, Stefano Piani, and Enrique Cerezo (also listed as &#8216;producer&#8217;).  Lucy (Asia Argento) goes about her life in the village, secretly consorting with the leader of the vampires, and her story could&#8217;ve easily been heavily truncated to balance out the flow of the first half.  Also, there are a handful of scenes involving the locals that &#8211; while their inclusion might help establish a plot point &#8211; don&#8217;t truly add much depth to the overall narrative.  In fact, by the time Van Helsing shows up to finally go &#8216;Grandpa Bad@ss&#8217; on everyone, I&#8217;d pretty much lost interest in everyone except Dracula.Despite all of these blemishes, Kretschmann (as the Count) turns in a nice main performance.  His Dracula is only charismatic in measured doses, fleshing out the ruler of the undead by giving him some emotional layers.  This, too, unfortunately doesn&#8217;t serve the entirety of the production as strongly as it should because everyone else seems to be mimicking his delivery; far too many lines of dialogue are whispered as if they have immeasurable significance to everything, and the end result of which the melodrama gets muddled in favor of the dramatic posturing of the players.Not good, Argento.  Not good.ARGENTO&#8217;S DRACULA (2013) (aka DRACULA 3D) is produced by Enrique Cerezo Producciones Cinematograficas S.A., Film Export Group, and Les Films de l&#8217;Astre.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group as part of the IFC Midnight series.  As for the technical specifications, the production has plenty of quality sights and sounds, but it&#8217;s all balanced out with some inexorably long takes; at 1:52:00, it feels at times closely to 5 hours &#8230; and that&#8217;s never a good thing.  If it&#8217;s special features you want, then there&#8217;s an impressive behind-the-scenes documentary (1 hr.), a music video, and a few theatrical trailers: a nice package, indeed, but enough about the ladies &#8230; (snicker snicker)(MODESTLY) RECOMMENDED.  Meh.  Argento purists (or is that &#8216;cultists&#8217;?) will probably be the only audience truly excited by this release.  The rest of us?  We&#8217;ll probably be left wondering what all the excitement is about.  I can appreciate even a good vampire story, and Argento&#8217;s obvious affection for the source material shines through; but so much of this DRACULA is down for the count.  (Get it?)  Argento&#8217;s signature non-blood-looking blood is everywhere &#8211; at one point looking like melted crayons while still at another like cheap wine &#8211; and the absolutely unnecessary (but appreciated!) emergence of ample bosoms can only sustain a man&#8217;s interest for so long.  Worth a view, but probably only one.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MPI Media Group and IFC Midnight provided me with an advance DVD copy of ARGENTO&#8217;S DRACULA by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
"It's truly painful to be a Dario Argento fan these days.  At this point when he makes a movie that manages to be halfway decent (The Card Player; Do You Like Hitchcock?) it actually feels like something of a triumph since most of his movies post Opera have been so dreadful.  Argento's Dracula falls very squarely in the awful camp--it may not be as awful as Mother of Tears but that movie was at least eye-popping in its sheer god-awfulness.  Dracula is lifeless and poorly acted, a boring movie by a director who no longer even seems to even be trying and whose directing talent seems to have degenerated to the level of Jess Franco.  If you're going to rent this keep your expectations very low--Dario Argento's Phantom of the Opera low.  I guess we can always hope the next one will be better."
"First off I'm gonna lay this on the table-I'm a big Dario Argento fan.  I""m actually a big, geeky Argento fanboy. As a matter of fact, Argento is my favorite film director.  Even got to meet him once.  So now that you know that, you'll probably assume that I tend to give many of his recent films the benefit of the doubt.  That's true, I do try to look for the positives, but I'm not deaf or blind-I am well aware that Argento's films have been a little.....lacking.... in the last decade or so.  It's the same kinda deal with guys like Romero and Hooper, where you don't really like to admit to yourself that they just aren't putting out very good stuff anymore.But I like to keep the faith.  I like to think that one day Argento will come out with something that'll kick us all in the teeth and make us forget about Phantom of the Opera or Giallo, or....take your pick.With a heavy heart I have to say that his version of Dracula just isn't that movie.  I mean, hell, the idea sounds great in theory, doesn't it?  Dario Argento taking on Dracula?  Of course in this daydream, it's the Suspiria era Argento taking on Dracula that I'm imagining, not the Mother of Tears/Giallo director.  So, yes, the idea of Argento doing a Hammer-esque movie sounds great.  But it isn't.If this film didn't already have Argento's name slapped onto it, I'd have had no idea he had directed it.  There's really nothing about it that says, ""This is a Dario Argento movie""-except for maybe his daughter baring her breasts.  What would a post 1993 Argento movie be without Asia showing us her boobs and/or butt?  In fact, this movie looks like something you'd see on the Syfy channel.  Syfy Channel Presents Dracula!  I would have guessed that before Argento had I gone into this totally ignorant.Thomas Kretchmann  makes for one of the most unmemorable movie Draculas of all time.  I kinda like the fact that Argento decided to try an actor who didn't fit the stereotypical Dracula look......but he still isn't good.  In fact, nobody here is that good.  Hauer just barely reaches good.There is way too much CGI in this film.  You want to instantly ruin a film for me, throw in some CGI, especially in places where it is totally lazy and unnecessary-like showing a spider crawl through it's web.  Or flies buzzing around a room. Or how about the silly CGI ""WHOOSH"" that accompanies Dracula when he's supposed to be moving fast?  Like in the scene where he charges into Harker's room and attacks him!  Find me someone who thinks this looks good and I'll eat my Official Sun Records baseball cap.  CGI has no place in a horror film to begin with, and while it looks lifeless and flat when done ""well"", it's especially irritating when it's lousy, as it is here.What the hell happened here?  What's happened to Dario Argento?  I'm not giving up on the guy, but something really went wrong here.  Unfortunately this will be a lot of peoples' first exposure to Argento.  If you're one of these people, please don't think this is a great representation of Dario Argento's work.  That would be like judging Judas Priest solely by the Turbo album.I'm a bit let down, but I know Argento still has a great one in him.  Lets just hope he doesn't try for Frankenstein next, though."
"I REALLY LIKED THE FIRST SEASON, AND SEASON TWO WAS GOOD BUT THE ENTIRE SHOW HAS GOTTEN RIDICULOUS.IT WAS NEVER GREAT DRAMA OR PARTICULARLY BELIEVABLE  BUT NOW THE ACTING IS TERRIBLE AND THE STORY LINE HAS DETERIORATED INTO TRASH. THE ACTING IS TERRIBLE."
"This movie had no meaning to it whatsoever. I mean the scripting was like and um??? A woman had an abortion, was poor, and her boyfriend was crippled.  I mean that's everyday life but it ended with no sense at all."
"The protagonist is also  the antagonist is this waste-my-time failure. This has nothing to do with &#34;RPG games.&#34;I found this character study to be completely unbelievable; I didn't buy/believe the premise, the plot, or the resolution. A waste of time; you'd be better off watching the clock hands go around, and you'll get more out of it. Yes, the &#34;hero&#34; (ha) has zero charisma, and in my opinion zero appeal as someone worth wasting an hour or so watching him fail - fail to entertain, fail to elicit sympathy/empathy, fail to resolve his crisis, fail to convince me that this has anything to do with reality.If you tell a tale about not having a life, about being a slacker, do-nothing, no-personality, neurotic loser, you'd expect that character to develop; however, ripping a crutch away from someone and beating another person with it is not exactly my idea of a reasonable, rational resolution. I kept thinking, OK, here's where he wakes up, OK, here's where he &#34;gets it,&#34; but that never happens; he remains an unsavory, severely troubled, pathetic loser. He doesn't need a dungeon, he needs to be put in one.As far as the RPG experience, the film gets it completely wrong; in my experience, it is not an activity for the marginally sane or geeks, or whatever the other characters were trying to portray. In my experience, it was a wonderfully creative, funny, dramatic and entertaining experience that filled an evening with camaraderie, creativity and fun, fun, fun. Rolling a 20 die has provided me with about as intense and delightful experience as anything I've done, but that would be another movie, and nothing like this one. I played AD&D; with bright, successful, creative people with supple minds, watched brilliant  solutions to complex problems develop out of a sense of both entertainment, team-play and creativity.  It was not an exercise for losers, it was a unique experience filled with comedy and adventure and a deep feeling of group consciousness and self-expression.So this film did not advance my understanding or appreciation for anything, it did not satisfy my sense of what a movie should deliver for a viewer, and as a story, it failed to propose, illuminate, or resolve anything. The film gets a zero charisma.Skip this, *especially* if you were a DND player of old - your real games were way better and way more interesting than this unresolved mess."
I tried to love this show but it is really awful. The acting is OK but the story line is terrible.
"I'm left in a cloud, what the heck did I just watch. Stupid. I really can't believe I sat through the whole thing.  It's crap."
"This is a notable episode because it marks the end of four years of pointless digging. In season one, self-confessed morphine addict Jack Hoffman started rather aimlessly digging a hole in Alaska. His mining technique was to rather aimlessly dig shallow holes with an excavator and test the results. Based on a tiny bit of gold being found in one hole, he and the TV announcers claimed that they were on the trail of a million-dollar pile of gold at the bottom of the hole.It didn't matter that the spot to dig seemed to have been at random. It didn't matter that what they were doing made no particular sense economically or as mining. All that mattered was digging the hole deeper.Four seasons later, the hole was 130 feet or so deep and had yielded a marginal amount of gold. But certainly not enough to pay the expenses of digging it out and running pumps to keep the water out.And finally in this episode, they gave up. The hole would go no deeper.All credit to Dakota Fred Hurt. He managed to get paid for nearly four seasons of television work aimlessly digging a hole. He kind of showed that the way to make money in this ""gold rush"" is to talk big, look busy but do as little work as you can get away with. With enough phony drama, you can get a bigger television audience to watch people dig a hole than you could for all the nature and science programming that used to be on the discovery channel.My hope is that next season they find a new can-do guy like maybe ""Nugget Brain"" Wayne to go back to the hole with rock drills and explosives to get down deeper where that million dollars of gold has to be. Four seasons and 130 feet just is not enough."
I tried to like Dracula.  I wanted to like Dracula.  But I was unable to enjoy it.  Mr. Grayson who is suppose to be Dracula is played by Jonathan Rhys Myers seems to have to concentrate on speaking his lines.  I don't know if it is because he is having issues with the accent or if he lost interest in his role but watching him speak is rather painful.  I know they are trying to revamp and give Dracula a new image but it seems odd to have him talking about Edison and having interest in a light bulb.  Maybe I am just stuck with liking the old mass murder Dracula but he only really drank from one victim aside from licking his female friend and pleasing her at the opera.  The ending rooftop battle was cheesey and I could have done without the Matrix/Crouching Tiger/Max Payne style of fighting.  The style of fighting didn't seem to go with the rest of the movie so it felt disconnected.
"I was so looking forward to this show, mostly because of Jonathan Rhys Meyers.  I couldn't think of a better actor to play the part.  However, whoever suggested he should play an American with a nasal accent was a bad, bad person.  He has such a beautiful accent that is part of his allure.  It just breaks my heart.  I can't even pretend to be turned on by this show.  Also, it's so dark and the story is boring.  Sorry.  Better luck next time."
The writing was bad. The acting was bad. How can you ruin a bloodsucker show ? Watch it if you like but I would save my money if I where you.
"...the music, and I don't mean that in a good way.  Boring, boring, boring and repetitive attempt at setting a spooky background.  Rhys-Meyers apparently has two or three facial expressions in his repertoire, with the most common one being that which can be seen in the title photo.  (He also seems to have shrunk in size since The Tudors.)  The plot is outrageous:  Dracula invents a non-electric power source?  Dracula heroically fights an evil, secret cartel????  I hold out faint hope that the series gets better as it progresses, but the best &#34;compliment&#34; I can give the five episodes I've viewed so far is that they were great sedatives."
"I loooooove JRM, but couldn't get into this show.  His &#34;American accent&#34; is not believable AT ALL, and the acting is pretty horrid.  I miss Tudors...  :-("
"Stupid B movie again. I only watched it because I like spook movies, but this is not, not even close."
"Despite a very good cast and clever stories, I just couldn't like the lead actor.  He looks like a runway model, first of all, and secondly his character is written as shallow, deceitful, self-absorbed, and manipulative.  He's just not likable.  Yet in every story the decent, caring, honest people all around him repeatedly overlook his betrayal of their trust!  He puts their careers, even their lives, in danger over and over again, but they accept his apology and go ahead and trust him again and again.  In real life he would be considered a sociopath and anyone involved with him would be a victim of his abusive, toxic personality.  Moving past the unpleasant lead character, let's talk about the women in his life.  All the women cast as his romantic interests are so thin as to look disturbingly anorexic.  Painfully scrawny, boney, and unhealthy.  Honestly, is this STILL the message we want to send to young women?  To starve themselves in order to be successful and desirable?  Despite the great supporting cast, I just couldn't continue to watch this, especially when there are so many other excellent programs available."
"Variation on a theme in TVland and cinema: those who stand accused are subject/responsible to social indictment from society; people never change their substance (""DNA""); the ""bad"" people belong behind bars or deserve to be killed.In No Good Deed (Episode #9), Neal recognizes that Peter is closed to him as anything more than a criminal. [The same as what the psychiatrist said to Neal.] Over the past 4 seasons, Peter takes every opportunity to remind Neal of his flawed character, usually jokingly, yet consistently labelling Neal as deficient, deviant ""criminal"" from the appropriate norm that Peter upholds as an FBI agent: Peter is better than Neal will ever be ... as a human being.Another show, A.L.I.A.S. showed the same moral indignation toward the character Sloane from Sydney Bristow.  Likewise, in The Aviator, Howard Hughes (Leonardo di Caprio) falls prey to the constant bullying from his airline rival (played by Alex Baldwin) despite his wealth and social stature.Is this constant theme giving us license to judge others or encouraging to accept intimidation and bullying as the nature of human interaction, our superiority complex?  I will wait the end of the season to find out where the writers think this leads.Not only is the Peter-Neal relationship at risk, the wife has on several occasions shown discontent with Peter's FBI career and ways. Furthermore, the writers may give us the ultimate friction: it may be revealed to Peter that ""the system"" does not work which wuld put Peter in conflict with himself."
Not a big action movie...kind of a love story with a possible war breaking up...but most scenes are following 2 girls throughsome situations...lots of scenery..  music to put ya to sleep also......and its really not a movie for us guys....as even if you paid me I wouldn't watch it again.
"As a viewer, I personally feel I can only asked to suspend disbelief through so many layers of the narrative.  I&#8217;m OK with quirky characters.  I&#8217;m OK with pretentious teenagers.  I&#8217;m OK with movie families that don&#8217;t quite seem grounded in reality but are &#8216;close enough&#8217; for purposes of the story.  But when you fold something like full-blown dementia into the tale I tend to draw a line.  It isn&#8217;t because I don&#8217;t like stories that explore a curious mental state; I find them fascinating.  Rather, I believe these tales need a very strong grounding in honesty for them to be relatable; if they&#8217;re not, then it all falls down like a cheaply built house of cards.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Emanuel (played by a comely Kaya Scodelario) is hardly your ordinary teenager.  Her mother died giving birth to her, and that grim reality has colored how she sees the greater world-at-large.  At work as a clerk in the town drug store, she&#8217;s smitten with the idea of constantly antagonizing her colleagues; and, at home, she&#8217;s always doing the same to her father (Alfred Molina) and stepmother (Frances O&#8217;Connor).  However, a mysterious new neighbor named Linda (Jessica Biel) suddenly presents her with an unusual opportunity to confront the questions of her own quirky mental state while perhaps helping to save the woman from a devastating future.I couldn&#8217;t begin to recount all of the problems I had with THE TRUTH ABOUT EMANUEL in any concise fashion, but I will say this: writer/director Francesca Gregorini did an impressive job chucking everything put the kitchen sink in here.  (Oh, yeah: there WAS a scene with the kitchen sink!)  There are many film influences at work here.  There&#8217;s also a willingness to discuss some very uncomfortable subjects like sanity and post-partum depression.  Still, despite the overabundance of psychological moodiness, TRUTH feels surprisingly empty.  Its stylish visuals only add up to a revelation that doesn&#8217;t so much involve Emanuel as it does Linda.  Liking the characters but hating their predicament as much as I did was the only reason I hung with this thing for its largely uneventful 96 minutes.As best as I can surmise, it would seem that Gregorini believes in a world wherein two wrongs make a right.  Both of these lead women &#8211; Scodelario and Biel &#8211; are mentally troubled, far more than one assumes is the norm; but, together, they&#8217;re destined for a cure.  For the life of me, I can&#8217;t see how two mentally-askew women (of this magnitude) is supposed to come up with a single sane mind, but I think that&#8217;s what the final scene intended audiences to take away from this.  My experience in reality has been that two misfits holed up together generally is not a good practice, but, then again, I don&#8217;t live in the movies.  I just write about them.For the life of me I can&#8217;t quite figure out what the story meant to say about Linda&#8217;s character as an individual.  Was her choice of denying reality the right thing to do?  Why not?  It worked for her.  Isn&#8217;t that what message Emanuel delivers by helping her finally put it all to rest?  Why do that?  Linda wasn&#8217;t hurting anyone except herself, unlike Emanuel who wanted to constantly irk everyone around her.  Is there union somehow what&#8217;s meant to be, or is it merely a film&#8217;s conceit?Assuming that the director (who also produced, too) makes most if not all of the decisions involving a film&#8217;s many elements, Gregorini chose to have Biel portray Linda as a kinda/sorta New Age flunky with strong hints of a femme fatale.  (???)  She gives the woman a devilishly mild sexual undercurrent that still confuses me.  She dresses Linda in some weird hippie stylings &#8211; well, so long as, say, Banana Republic gets into lounge hippie-wear &#8211; and adorns her house with elegant, high-end furnishings.  None of the pieces to this puzzle added up to me, nor did they fact that she apparently has been on-the-run for as long as she has been, so how was her personal story even probable much less possible?When I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m supposed to make of all of the individual pieces, then all I&#8217;m left with is the created whole &#8211; and the whole?  I just couldn&#8217;t believe nor accept its simple final message.  Without mincing words, I think the subject matter explored here was very important, very relevant.  It&#8217;s this particular story that just felt more than a bit lost on me.THE TRUTH ABOUT EMANUEL (2013) is produced by MRB Productions, Pisces Rising Productions, Rooks Nest Entertainment, Producciones A Ciegas, Mott Street Pictures, and Votiv Films.  DVD distribution is being handled by Well Go USA Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications, this is one smartly shot character film with some very high quality sights and sounds.  If it&#8217;s special features you want, then you have a director&#8217;s interview, deleted scenes, the theatrical trailer, and perhaps the most painful and curiously inappropriate assortment of outtakes (less than a minute of them) to look forward to.(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED.  THE TRUTH ABOUT EMANUEL is an oddity.  It gets my award for the best misnamed film of the year mostly because there&#8217;s hardly any truth about Emanuel served up here &#8211; nothing in her life history has changed that I can detect &#8230; except maybe the development of some Mutant Age powers that gives her personal yet possibly inaccurate insight into the psychological deficiencies of others &#8230; and, even then, it isn&#8217;t as if she can do much about it.  And what should we call her?  DementiaGal?  That just doesn&#8217;t sound right, not with this whole &#8216;War on Women&#8217; frenzy currently afflicting society.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Well Go USA Entertainment provided me with an advance DVD copy of THE TRUTH ABOUT EMANUEL by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
weird...
"Two-and-a-half stars. I almost liked this movie. Started out intriguing, then with a shock. But there were just too many questions I had and I'll start with this: yes, spoilers. If I discovered what Em discovered about her neighbor, I'd get the hell outta that house pronto! There were also several other things that just made no sense. Okay, another spoiler: it would seem like a mental institution would have security throughout the entire building, including hidden cameras. So as the story progressed, I admired the good acting, but not the plot. Just nonsense. It's up to you, but I wasted my money."
"This movie was less SciFi and more Zombie on Mars.  Don't get me wrong I like zombie movies, but I had hoped for a sci-fi thriller contagion kind of thing.  This was extremely predictable."
"Sometimes it is so apparent that one movie is a rip-off another one.  In this film, it was probably a rip-off from Prometheus and Ghost of Mars.  Basically, a group of astronauts living on Mars encounter a microbial life form that infects them, and turns each infected person into a killer.  The movie tries to add a little variety by using an international cast, by providing some internal conflicts among the astronauts such as professional rivalries and personal jealousies, and by giving the lead astronaut a case of claustrophobia jumpstarted by an accident on his mission.  The acting and dialogue are OK.  The special effects are good, as is the scenery of Mars.  However, the plot is all too similar to prior movies, and of course everyone dies, some quickly some slowly.  Overall, a solid waste of two hours."
"The Last Days on Mars(released May/13)stars,among others, Liev Schreiber, Elias Koteas,Romola Garai,Goran Kosti&#263; and Johnny Harris.This is a terribly derivative picture which from the opening moments tumbles into a deep pit from which it never extricates itself.Been there,done that barely scratches the surface as to how defective this film really is.The story finds a small colony of humans on the red planet busy doing their respective experiments and generally studying the surface area.The astronauts are made up of a multi national group,with the leader being Canadian.At one point a relay switch goes down and one of them volunteers to go out to fix it,but it is  a ruse to check an experiment station.While the crew inside discover possible life on a sample brought in,the one gone outside has also discovered it.Just then the ground gives way crumbling around him, and he falls into the ground.Those with him contact base and they get assistance toute suite.They end up going down into the steam filled fissure,not finding their fellow astronaut but finding some strange ground life.When the astronaut resurfaces they find tracks leading away from the site and heading back to their main living pod.As they head back, the pod comes under attack from two of their fellow astronauts who have turned into horribly disfigured creatures.The rest return in time to rescue the remaining crew but one, who has been killed.They retreat to a hydroponics pod and try to help their dying commander,but to no avail.He &#34;dies&#34; but soon comes back to life as he turns also.They try a jury rigged antibiotic but it does no good.Schrieber heads back to the main pod to try and contact home for help, but eventually is forced to retreat back to  hydroponics.He and two others flee into land rovers to escape the others.One leaves to take another rover and next morning another leaves Schreiber's rover and walks away.He follows but is unable to save her,and instead has to kill her.At this time a rescue landing craft dispatched from the orbiting space station above lands in the open.As Schreiber runs back to it it is attacked and its crew killed.Inside at the controls he finds the astronaut who took the other rover.He is also infected.He puts the ship into a power burn and it leaves Mars orbit,burning too much fuel.All the while the two struggle and Schreiber defeats the turned one,only to get infected himself.Now alone,he contacts home base to inform them of the situation,telling them he has no fuel to land and will likely burn up in the atmosphere,the preferable solution as opposed to a rescue.This film is one slow step up after another,as one crisis inevitably leads into another,and so on.Each you can see coming a mile away and each step up becomes two back as the movie's pace just slows to a crawl and you start looking at your watch wondering when this thing is going to be over with.When the astronauts become infected,this is my title reference to the 2001 film Ghosts of Mars,as the infected in that look like those in this.You would have thought they could have been more original.I guess it's just a Mars thing.Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.There are no extras and in fact there are NO scene selections either!Astounding.This is first film on DVD I have ever encountered with no scene selections,just a straight &#34;play&#34; option and that's it.In conclusion give this turkey a pass and watch The Ghosts of Mars.It wasn't that good either, but it was far better than this sleep fest."
"Here's my problem with this movie. For some reason whoever cast this movie decided to use actors from Ireland, the UK or wherever. What pisses me off to know end, all of the foreign actors are speaking so fast and don't seem to know how to enunciate their words I can barely understand what these actors are saying.. It got so bad for me that I shut off the movie and 30 mins. I guess Ruairi Robinson is deaf and didn't notice how they were speaking. I have nothing against foreign actors but I do have something against any actor who doesn't know to speak slower or enunciate their words.Truly a terrible job by these actors."
"&#34;People don't really change. Put them in enough pressure and you find out who they really are.&#34; A group of astronaut explorers are sent to Mars to explore. When they begin to collect specimens one of them falls mysteriously ill and dies suddenly. No one can figure out why but little by little the conditions worsen until it becomes a fight for survival and escape. I am becoming more and more of a sci-fi fan. I think it has to do with the quality of movies in that genre that are being released. Contrary to most genres the big budget movies seem to be the best ones released. There have been a few standouts, Moon comes to mind, but really Prometheus and Gravity were awesome and I have started to become more excited about new sci-fi movies. After having said all that I was very disappointed in this one. The main problem with this was that it was just to slow, generic and really just not exciting at all. I didn't connect with any of the characters and once again the movie seemed to try too hard to be Alien, and once again fell short. Overall, hardcore sci-fi fans may like this, but to me I found it really hard to get interested in. I give it a C-."
I watched this movie waiting for the suspense and instead I got bored. The ending was expected and a let down. Gld that this was just a rental
"Has many flaws in my opinion that make it not worth the money.  If it were free, okay.  The best way to describe what I disliked about this movie is to ask the question, &#34;Why would you put your tongue on a buzz saw to see if the blade is turning?&#34;  That does not happen in this movie, but if it had--maybe the movie would have been better."
It was not half as good as some here are rating it.  Must be family members of the cast and or crew.  It was also very boring and lacked any real gore other than a constant pit of dead corpses that look really good considering how long they've been rotting.  I also noticed there were no maggots on the corpses.  HMMMM  My final thought  - Lame-O-Rama.
"No need to rent...just watch the preview, you see the whole show! Why are the previews so revealing these days. No tease... just let it all out. Not good."
"Nothing new here. It's a parody of Noir, but with nothing innovative. If you have absolutely nothing else to watch, then go for it."
"The acting is really good, but the plot is a bit dull and depressing. I won't be watching the next episode."
"For the first 30 minutes or so, this seems promising. The acting and script are ok. Then, as the main character develops increasingly bizarre symptoms after her one-night stand with a mysterious stranger, the whole movie loses all credibility. No one around her seems to notice that she is beginning to look like a ... um.....zombie. She has weird blues lines all over her face and her eyes are full of blood, but the restaurant manager where she works insists that she come in and work anyway. Duh. And then the doctor she goes to completely doesn't note that she is looking like something from outerspace, not just someone with an STD. Oh well. And forget the ending. By then, it's become a comedy."
"I&#8217;m a big fan of zombie films.  I&#8217;ve always loved stories that have tinkered in this world wherein the dead aren&#8217;t quite dead &#8211; not, at least, the way they should be &#8211; and I think there have been many good films as well as there have been great films to explore the subject matter from a whole variety of perspectives.  What frustrates me about the smaller zombie films is almost one problem I see universally: there&#8217;s only the germ of an idea.  In other words, there really isn&#8217;t any story; rather, there&#8217;s a collection of incidents or vignettes carefully strung together in the attempt to coerce a story where there truly isn&#8217;t one.  Sure, the idea may be grand, but &#8211; lacking a legitimate through-line &#8211; it&#8217;s still only an idea when the credits roll.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Depressed from a lull in her romantic life, young Samantha (played by a pleasantly fresh-faced Najarra Townsend) decides to go to her friend&#8217;s party and live it up.  But a chance encounter with a possible sexual predator leaves the woman making the worst possible decision: she engages with unprotected sex with the first mysterious man she happens across.  What starts out as some mild physical discomfort suddenly warps her body into something much deadlier as she spends the next three days paying the ultimate price for a momentary lapse in judgment.OK, let&#8217;s get this out of the way up front: I know every one of us &#8211; you, me, your mom, etc. &#8211; we&#8217;ve all made a bad decision.  I&#8217;m not talking about turning right when we should&#8217;ve turned left.  I&#8217;m really more interested in those kind of decisions that we always wish we could&#8217;ve taken back.  It doesn&#8217;t have to be anything life-threatening; but it&#8217;s still something we wish we could&#8217;ve done differently and saved ourselves a lot of headache, heartache, or stomach ache along the way.That said, there&#8217;s the great little germ of idea in CONTRACTED, and &#8211; the way I see it &#8211; it kinda/sorta boils down to this: writer/director Eric England had this clever (if not comical) idea of where zombies truly come from.  Without spoiling it (though the product packaging actually does that fairly well if you read it), let&#8217;s just say that it involves a little bit of what would be normally harmless necrophilia and one night of casual sex.Still with me?OK, right there, that&#8217;s clever.  It&#8217;s even a bit inspired.  It probably isn&#8217;t going to win any awards by itself, but it shows that some honest creative thought went into a process that ended up getting committed to celluloid, and now you&#8217;re here reading about it.Now, is that idea strong enough on its merits to sustain the interest of a 90-minute motion picture?Well, so far as this critic is concerned, England&#8217;s story here isn&#8217;t.  Sadly, there&#8217;s far too much chickified emotional baggage that firmly holds down the first half of the film as we explore Samantha&#8217;s everyday life and wade through some personal circumstances that aren&#8217;t riveting enough to have us wait for the stuff of real substance to occur.  From what I learned, she&#8217;s going through a bad break-up; she&#8217;s definitely struggling with her sexuality; and she lies to a personal physician about a very private matter.  (Never a good idea, Samantha, no matter how embarrassing your screw-up was.)  In fact, we spend so much time exploring Sam&#8217;s bad choices that, at one point, I started to wonder why we were even watching her at all &#8230; then I remembered there was that whole &#8216;contracted&#8217; illness thing that was promised in the offset, so I stuck it out.Once it becomes clear that this is no ordinary STD, then the picture elevates to appreciable heights, but that&#8217;s fairly late in the 90 minutes.  Dare I suggest what I&#8217;ve done many times before that CONTRACTED would&#8217;ve been vastly more entertaining as a short film?  It has a very TWILIGHT ZONE-esque feel to all of it, and, as frightening as it was to watch poor li&#8217;l strugglin&#8217; Samantha come more and more apart psychologically she was vastly more &#8216;becoming&#8217; as a character once I knew for certain we were leaving her behind and, in her place, was something more exciting?  I mean &#8230; what does it say about us culturally when we finally uncover that, as zombies, the lives we&#8217;ll lead may be vastly more interesting than what we did as ordinary human beings?That&#8217;s the real chiller, if you ask me.  Yes, it&#8217;s a cautionary tale, but that part of it&#8217;s been done before &#8230; and much better.CONTRACTED (2013) is produced by BoulderLight Pictures and Southern Fried Films.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group on behalf of the IFC Midnight label of flicks.  As for the technical specifications, my suspicion is that this nifty little indie production benefitted from a respectable budget, as the picture does contain some very good quality sight and sounds as well as a good handful of practical, in-camera effects and make-up work.  Lastly, if it&#8217;s special features you want, then buckle up: the disc offers two separate commentary tracks as well as a &#8216;making-of&#8217; short, some behind-the-scenes fodder (nothing all that grand there), the animated pitch, Ms. Townsend&#8217;s audition tape, and the theatrical trailer.  That is a nice package, indeed, for those wanting to know more about the world of CONTRACTED.(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED.  If you&#8217;re as die-hard about your zombie flicks as I am, then you&#8217;re likely to sit through this despite the turgid pacing.  Methinks writer/director England was trying to say something about either life or relationships or maybe even one-night-stands in our communicable-friendly world, but I gotta say I missed it.  Instead, what I did see was a great idea poorly shackled with the emotional baggage of Katherine Heigl&#8217;s next direct-to-DVD stinker.  Townsend&#8217;s performance?  That&#8217;s actually pretty solid, though I&#8217;d find it hard-pressed to see how her work here might open any doors for her.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MPI Media Group provided me with an advance DVD copy of CONTRACTED by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review."
"Disappointing body horror flick (think early David Cronenberg but without the pulpy thrills) about a young lesbian who is roofied at a party and has unprotected sex with a man in his car.  The next day she starts feeling sick and is eventually convinced that she has a sexually transmitted disease.Contracted has a lot of promise that it never fulfills, both because of lack of imagination and unnecessary implausibilities that make the movie feel a whole lot dumber than it apparently thinks it is.When the main character goes to her doctor with alarming symptoms that include extensive vaginal bleeding and a slowed heart rate he tells her she has a head cold.  When she goes back a day later with even more alarming symptoms including teeth and hair falling out and bloody red eyes he tells her to avoid contact with other people until the results of her blood test comes back when a more reasonable response would be to admit her to a hospital and possibly contact the CDC.The police are looking for anyone who came into contact with that man at the party, which suggests they might know something about what is happening to the heroine, but she refuses to go to the police and her friend who gave the party, knows her friend had sex with the guy, knows her friend is super sick and is visited by the police multiple times also neglects to inform them.  Instead she tells the girl's lesbian lover, which might make sense to the people who made this movie but, under the circumstances, seemed pretty bizarre to me.It also would have been cool if the lead character was spreading a plague without realizing it (like Marilyn Chambers in Rabid) and she works in a restaurant, preparing salads, touching glasses and dishes and silverware--which would be the perfect way to accidentally spread a deadly disease--but the movie does absolutely nothing with this obvious narrative opportunity, which seems like a huge waste.Contracted follows the least interesting path that it possibly can given its set-up and ends up being a well-acted but dull horror film with a few gross images but not much else."
"Samantha (Najarra Townsend) part time lesbian and drug user gets slipped a roofie at a party and has unprotected car sex. The next few days, Sam gets progressively worse as she seems to have the worse STD on the planet. The story is about her getting sick and attempting to cope with life while trying to conceal an illness. I kept waiting for an alien to pop out of her and all I got were maggots.The disease was never explained. I thought Ms. Townsend did an excellent job and I would love to see her in something that has a plot worth watching. The plot ran around in circles and never went anywhere until the end when it got silly.Written, produced, and directed by Eric England.  Works as a rental. Don't expect horror. More of a drama/thriller.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex. Brief male rear nudity."
"This story line dragged on far too long. Nikita, billed as a highly skilled, highly trained assassin, fails to cancel her nemesis until the final episode of a four year run. One has to question the talents of this assassin.Every episode contains the same basic story line. Chase Amanda, find her, fail to capture her or cancel her as these folks are trained to do.One word for this season and the seriers in general, BORING!!!!!"
"I haven't been enthralled with this season - too many plot lines, too many supporting characters introduced that are vaguely defined and, god help me, they're even reintroducing minor characters from previous seasons that I barely recall. Follow it all best I can but it  seems they really don't have a strong vision for the season - just bits and pieces they're stringing together to keep the whole convoluted mess chugging along."
"Great storyline and good set work. The English actor really needs to leave, he is terrible and distracts from the others. I will see how the next release is to make a decision. The profanity is way over the top...no normal people talk that way so why do the writers need to have &#34;F&#34; words dropping left and right."
"My husband wants to watch it, he seems to think there will be some kind of ending. The first three seasons were actually good. Now it is boring, the actors seem to be sleep-walking through their parts. They all have the same facial expressions in every scene. The killing seems to take place of a plot. There is not any depth to any episode, no thinking necessary. No kudos to the writers. They bring back the same old stuff, without any real new story."
Too bloody and cold-hearted for my liking.  This does not give the southern way of live a true rendition.  There is a big difference between &#34;talking about violence&#34; and &#34;actually showing it&#34;.I doubt if I will watch any more episodes of this series.
"Really like the series but um.... WTH is going on?.....The gross, sexist, goofy, stupid-face guy from &#34;The Office&#34; as US Marshall? The fat comedic-actor from &#34;Mad TV&#34; & the weirdo comedic-actor from &#34;The Kids In the Hall&#34; as gangsters? CANADIAN gangsters!? Is this a joke?..... Is Ashton gonna jump out from being the camera? WHY is Steve & Wood Harris in this!? I am SICK of seeing Steve & Wood Harris ugly faces, they should&#8217;ve been left in the 90&#8217;s where they belong (all they ever play is THUG roles anyway). I actually got excited when I saw David Rapaport (He&#8217;s a great actor. He can be gansta, dramatic, or comedic so I was game for whatever he was going to do *lol*) then I was soon disappointed when I saw that he was playing a greasy hillbilly gator-poacher. He could barely hold on to that fake southern-accent *lol* the &#8220;New York&#8221; slipped outta him on several occasions. What&#8217;s the deal with casting the ugliest skanky-looking women to bang Rayland *lol* but yet the estranged-wife (who is beautiful) wants nothing else to do with him. What talent-less casting director (who apparently got their job by sleeping with the producer) is responsible for all of this?It is also apparent that the writers are now lazy p0t-heads, because the script is truly failing in this season. The character Rayland Givens gets entirely too much camera time. He needs his role cut WAY down to about 12% (or zero). At this point I don't even want to hear from the Rayland character anymore.......... and STOP bringing that smart (but dumb as heck) teen Loretta back to the show. She's boring and annoying. You sent her off to a foster home,now leave her there. You all have gone totally over board with the bloody murder scenes. I enjoy action & gore (I love gangster movies) but you all seem to keep adding characters just so you can have 4 to 5 bloody murder/attempted-murder scenes during each episode. I mean, DAMN&#8230;We get it!&#8230;.It&#8217;s a cop/gangster series but does someone need their brains blown out and splattered all over the faces of everyone in the vicinity during EVERY other scene!?Also....For someone who is stiff as a board, walks like a senior citizen with arthritis, and is ALWAYS recovering from a hangover&#8230;.Rayland Givens sure is nimble when it comes to subduing up to 7 bad guys with weapons. You write his character as if he is invincible. How hard would it be for paid assassins to kill someone who comes home and passes out DRUNK every night in their filthy seedy poorly secured motel room? Realistically, a cop like that (who is an absolute d!@%& that does the things that he&#8217;s done) would've been murdered a LONG time ago. He also would've been FIRED or demoted to traffic cop a long time ago too.Boyd Crowder (as always) is carrying the HELL out of this show I pretty much tune in to see his and Ava's drama. Unfortunately their camera time has been drastically reduced. It&#8217;s only the first two episodes of the season and I fast-forwarded through most of it to get to the good parts. Dammit!&#8230;.. I feel like I made a mistake by paying for a season pass rather than just waiting to watch it for free like the other ones.&#8230;&#8230;Hey FX/Justified Producers: GET YOUR @!%& TOGETHER!"
These two dumb girls decide to ride their bikes and come across a water tank. They are drunk and strip to their underwear. It is dark so one jumps in and the other follows without even checking the tank for a way of escape. Well the water is at a low level and they have a hard time getting out.I waited till the end to see if they ever could figure out how to get out and it was quite clever I will admit. But not everything goes right! The ladder was too high so they had to improvise. If I ever got stuck in this situation I will remember this trick but I won't get into this situation!
It was alright not horrible.
"Nine Things about &#34;Here Comes the Devil&#34;1. This Mexican horror film could have been really good. But I ended up being pretty disappointed with it.2. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't know what it wants to be - a serial killer movie, a demonic possession movie, a psychological thriller, or &#34;Paranormal Activity&#34; (I mean, can we stop with the levitating-above-the-bed thing?).3. It starts out with a lesbian sex scene that has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Then one of the lesbians gets her fingers cut off.  A few minutes later, a mom has sex with her husband in a car while her kids disappear.4. When the kids come back, they're acting all weird. Like they have either been molested, or possessed. The parents try to solve the problem by taking the matter into their own hands. It doesn't work.5. There are little clues all the way through to hint at what's going on. The problem is, the clues don't make any sense, either.6. You know the old horror movie truism that if you have sex, you get killed? This movie teaches something similar, except the lesson is that if a woman enjoys sex, she will either be mutilated or put she will put her children in mortal danger.7.  On the plus side, it does dare to take on subjects that American movies won't. Like middle-school siblings having sex with each other.8. It's got a nice film style, and some individual scenes are chilling. It just doesn't add up to anything, because it doesn't even know where it's heading.9. I have no idea what the ending means."
"This episode wasn't. Sorry Matt. Good luck selling hot dogs from a cart in your next career. Why do all these actors feel like they have to just go down? Disassociate themselves with the part? Sad. There were lots of problems with this ending, but I won't go through them. They have been blasted by so many others. The battles were pointless and irrelevant, the plot was scatter-shot, the interactions felt hazily thrown together.This is not going to stop the guy directing from directing, clearly, so we can look forward to more of this kind of crappy, phoned-in writing. And Capaldi, don't even get me started. Is there anyone else that could feel LESS like Doctor Who? The guy gave me the creeps. His performance seemed contrived, like he had memorized his lines on the way to the set after picking up fast food. A burger in one hand and a script in the other. TELL ME THIS ISN'T WHERE THIS FRANCHISE IS HEADED!!! Please."
"The script was hard to follow, the acting was mediocre and the subject matter lacked continuity. I felt Like it was mostly a waste of time."
I found it so boring from the very start that I didn't even watch it all. Total waste of time.
"Stupid, contrived plot.  Crummy acting. I will not rent any more episodes. Cliches after cliches . No more words . Thanks"
"The dancing is enjoyable, though some of the choreography is questionable.  Having so many sexualized costumes and dance conceits is both unnecessary and inappropriate.But what is really awful is all the faked silly and petty drama."
"I appreciate what is was for the era and it does have some entertainment value, however, it is lacking in real thrill or surprise."
"This is like a Reader's Digest version of several crimes in one short episode. They covered a half dozen or so in the first episode, so how much content could be there? It's just an overview, really. Not worth bothering with."
"Suspension of disbelief is a necessary element to enjoy any form of fiction, but this television show asks a bit too much.  The beautiful people travel from their glass and steel post-modern architecture museum (presented as the CDC) to exchange a few cleverly laconic lines with the suspiciously overly-suspicious scientists conducting what are obviously evil-minded experiments at an arctic facility the extravagance of which would make Dr. No blush.Many details of this program display a lack of research or, worse, indifference to real life and to science.  Not all sci-fi needs to be hard, by any means, but this show pushes the envelope a little too far.  We have internet, now.  Even screenwriters can fact-check basic things.Finally, there is the obvious love interest: a perfectly plausible, model-gorgous, mid-twenties super-scientist with 15 years of qualifications and experience, swooping in on our remarkably suave leader in obvious conflict with his ex-wife, who is also on the small team of scientists.  I can see where this is going.  I just don't want to sit through it.Overall, this is like watching a Saturday morning cartoon stirred with soap opera and garnished with live actors.  It makes me want a real drink."
"Is there a word that is a more intense version of ridiculous because that is all I can think of concerting ""Helix"".The two main male characters seem to be having a contest as to who can whisper the softest and the most.The plot is just stupid, but mostly it jumps from thread to thread, and never really progresses.  This most closely reminds me of Lost (after it just got irritating) ... maybe they should call the base a Dharma Station.  Don't waste your time unless you get this for free ... and I'm betting you will not have to wait long before it shows up on NetFlix and Amazon Prime."
"- it's nothing serious.Helix either needs to escalate fast or go away. I had high hopes given the producer, actors, and premise, but they're dragging the secret base/mysterious virus/conspiracy tropes on too long. Far too long. The actors are doing the best they can, but their characters aren't developed or likable enough to care about. Big name producer, rager-zombie types, and incongruous dated pop music don't compensate for weak characterization and thin storyline. My opinion? Initiate Quarantine Protocol -  leave it alone. There's better ways to use your entertainment time."
"Do you remember &#34;Lost&#34;? How it built up a complicated web of secrets, hints and mysteries... and eventually, we found out the creators had NO plan in place, and were just making it up as they went along, leaving huge swathes of the story unexplained?In a sense, &#34;Helix&#34; is the heir to &#34;Lost's&#34; throne. This series feels like it has been made up with no particular plan in mind, and with half-a-dozen genres that it bounces between like a Ping-Pong ball -- we have rage zombies, realistic epidemiology, sci-fi diseases, lots of soap-opera backstabbing, and villains who pop in and out of the story whenever things threaten to get boring.Dr. Alan Farragut (Billy Campbell) and his team -- including his ex-wife Dr Julia Walker (Kyra Zagorsky) and his adoring student Dr. Sarah Jordan (Jordan Hayes) -- are dispatched to an arctic research base to investigate a potentially deadly outbreak. But Farragut's real reason for going is that his brother Peter (Neil Napier) has been infected with a weird virus that makes you ooze black goo. Peter also broke up Alan's marriage by sleeping with Julia... which makes the whole thing less awkward than you would expect.It's immediately obvious that Dr. Hiroshi Hatake (Hiroyuki Sanada) is hiding something about this bizarre new disease, especially since the infected people show bizarre new powers. And after Julia is infected -- but somehow does not turn into a rage zombie -- Alan begins to uncover a horrifying conspiracy linked with the completely and utterly evil Ilaria Corporation (corporations are always completely evil in bad horror!) which could wipe out the entire world.At times, &#34;Helix&#34; is like watching a soap opera -- we have sexual affairs (past and present), a fatal brain tumor, kidnapped children, secret parents, long-lost family, cold-blooded murder, redeeming love, tragic backstory involving alcoholism, and other hackneyed plot elements that just fill up space. Nobody is here to see Alan and Julia awkwardly talking about why she slept with his brother -- we want rage zombies vomiting tar into people's mouths.But admittedly, the first few episodes of the show have promise. There are a few interesting characters (Dr. Boyle, a chubby quirky mortician) and a series of hints that all is not as it seems (Hatake's glowing blue eyes). Consider the chilling image of frozen, screaming monkeys lodged in the ice outside. But then Boyle is killed, and we're left with a cast mostly made up of stiff, thin-lipped, expressionless white people whom we have little reason to like. It's like watching a Twilight movie.But as the thirteen episodes wind on, it becomes painfully obvious that there was little planning -- or if there was planning, then they bungled the delivery. The disease seems to change from episode to episode, depending on what the writers want, as do its effects. The infected people themselves just sort of... vanish whenever they're not convenient to the story. And whenever things get too boring, some villainous corporate types will show up to gorily kill people at random, and then be awkwardly and abruptly dispatched. And there's a weird subplot about one of Hatake's underlings spending time with the long-lost family of ANOTHER underling, and... it's all very dull and ultimately unnecessary.And when the writers finally vomit out an explanation for what's going on, it's too little too late -- large chunks of the conspiracy were never really properly explained. It feels like the creators -- including Ronald D. Moore -- just threw in everything they thought would be cool, and then patched it together later into a hasty, unsatisfying explanation.The saving grace of this show is respected Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada. While his accent occasionally makes it hard to tell what he's saying, Sanada shines like a lighthouse in the middle of all the more mediocre performances -- in his hands, Hatake is a conflicted and complicated character, doing terrible things but also stopping the far more terrible menace to humanity.&#34;Helix Season 1&#34; is a big goopy tar-colored mess -- it's hard to believe that this was produced by the same guy who gave us &#34;Battlestar Galactica.&#34; Perhaps the second season will be an improvement."
"If you are ok with fairly wooden acting, uninspired dialog, unimpressive mediocre special effects....AND, yet another virus that rapidly turns one into a frothing at the mouth violent creature (dripping with black crude oil---reminiscentof the X-Files)-----go for it! It's not without some entertainment value.....but it's definitely been there/done that type of virus zombie fare. Definitely needs some work to come up to par with all the other cool avant garde TV shows that are out there now."
"The writers leave gaping holes just to keep the story going.  A whole hand in fact gets dismissed and the 'bad' gets away. People moving about and sleeping alone, does not help keep them safe. The security guards are never to be seen when it counts, etc. Two shows and I'm done.  Also, I hate the name change for the network."
"When I saw this series was produced by the same person who created the x-files I jumped on it. But this series just doesn't bring to the table any useful suspense. It drags out in piece meal some kind of drama that is more like a soap opera and feeds you bits of information that just seem like they are trying to make it to the next episode. I ended up just reading the short write up of each episode until the last and could pretty much get the idea that there wasn't much to come so I gave up after the second episode. I could be wrong and I know shows are so person specific that you may love this one but it just wasn't for me, hopefully it is someone else's style and genre."
"My wife and I watched a couple of episodes and found Helix slow, gross and predictable.  CGI comically bad at times."
"Stupid show. Terrible dialogue, cheap special effects and poorly developed characters. The helicopter is so cheap looking it is a joke. Nothing looks cold. Very empty and boring."
I watched the first episode and that was enough.  Be warned there are some spoilers so don't read on if you want to watch.If you want to watch intelligent drama this isn't it.  They find out that it isn't airborne so they take their head gear off.  I wouldn't be so fast to do so since what if it's through skin contact or ingestion?  They wander around without head gear and come across a Monkey  loose in a room.  Wouldn't you think the Monkey might be infected?  They try to catch it and I love Monkeys as much as the next person but the lady practically lip locks the thing.  I could go on but you get the point.  I won't be watching any more of this.
"This show needs to do something. The season finale involved a guy digging in the mud and coming up with nothing. Not a guy with a back hoe excavating a secret tunnel entrance but a scuba diver lifting much for a few minutes. I want to know about the mystery of Oak Island as well. Not the history, Wikipedia has that covered but what's under the ground. If this show is going to make it, season 2 is going to have to involve some actual searching of the island instead of meeting with elderly people who have crazy ideas about it."
"So many of these kinds of TV shows are planted federal govt agencies' information. This planted information is to build a body of knowledge. The knowledge primarily is for the lower ranks of IQ people to gain support from these weak thinking American people. God, I hope it does not work and I hope that these weak minded people do not exist after all the Iraqi war and all. These so called masses of people, according to the federal agencies that produce these films, need to be informed in accordance with Agency propaganda. American innocence is gone. When the torture scenes are shown any thinking person will feel as though America is just as bad - based on what Cheney and Bush have done, rendition, black opps ( :) ), Abu Grab (again :)  ), water boarding, and so much more. So, return to the old days of uninformed Americans with this show. The lead character, Sarah Grimes. Naive as a 10 year old. Home problems are of 1950 kind of portrayal. America and American CIA agents are heroes, giants of strength, dedicated beyond human effort of most, pretty, slim, stressed. So silly. Stupid music. How American agents suffer is childish. It is all so laughable. Reminds me of Rocky Horror Show: You know, the film is meaningless, but we go to laugh, throw stuff, dress as one of the dumb characters. If any person continues to watch this series must be one with an IQ of an innocent 10 year old. By all means, skip this show, do not waste your money."
"I'm going to have trouble finding twenty words on this one.  I just plain didn't like it.  Other people seem to have liked it a lot, but I didn't.  I'm no critic; but that's the idea behind these reviews, I guess, to get a broad view of public opinion.  Well, here's mine:  I don't think they worked very hard on this one.  It seemed to me like a low budget production. I hate to make negative comments on anybody's creative effort, but when I compare it with the other series out there, I have to say I don't think they tried very hard, or maybe they underestimated their competition."
"Not a fan of ruzek anymore, lame, hate it, unrealistic, hard to feel sympathetic to the detectives anymore yuk nasty mean underhanded dirty cops"
Really tired of these drama series' that hire gorgeous people that don't have any depth to their characters. Unconvincing and boring.
"Came to this one late, not uncommon from this distance.  Didn't really like the first episode, found it to be too formuladriven - a combination of Teen Wolf and any of the various vampire programs out there.  Stilted dialog did not help.  I will likely not watch any more of this offering.  That said, while this is not anywhere near my cup of tea it no doubt appeals to fans of the genre and more power to them. It's our differences that make this old world so interesting."
"The show is based on a book series called &#34;women of the otherworld&#34;.  I'm assuming the novels are written for teenage girls-- it would explain why Elena is the center of everyone's universe.  It would also explain her terrible dialog: &#34;You raised an amazing son&#34; &#34;It's gonna be an amazing wedding&#34; &#34;Your outfit is amazing&#34;.  More on Black Hole Sue later.I actually liked the first episodes a lot.  It's an interesting idea to have people transform into wolves and not some horrible monster.  I also liked how they acted like a pack.  The meal couldn't begin until Jeremy had the first bite, and there was a scene where he's looking out a window, watching his pack &#34;play&#34;.  It was interesting sociologically to look at a group of people modeling their lives after wolves.  I also liked the idea of the Mutts.  Without an alpha, dogs and wolves are unpredictable and dangerous.  In other words, I bought in fully to the premise and I thought this may be my new favorite show.After the first few episodes, it became unwatchable, mainly because everything was about Elena and making her happy.  When Elena is in Toronto, the camera shows us what's happening without her in Stonehaven.  The pack is all &#34;What's up with Elena?&#34;  &#34;How can we get Elena back?&#34;  &#34;We need to give Elena her space&#34; &#34;How can we make life easier for Elena?&#34;.  Now the camera does indeed go to Toronto:  Elena is having sex with her human fianc&eacute;, and afterwards she engages in pillow talk. (one of the only times her constant whispering makes sense)  However, Elena has a secret and scurries off leaving the fianc&eacute; alone.  Now it's the fianc&eacute;'s turn to ask &#34;What's up with Elena?&#34;  &#34;How can I get Elena back?&#34;  &#34;How can I make life easier for Elena?&#34;And why are all the men obsessed with her?  She's self obsessed and is always threatening to leave the pack or disappear on Philip.  She seems to have no personality.  Actually, her personality is to wear pricey outfits, talk about herself all the time (in a constant whisper) and complain.  Elena is the most boring and self involved person I can ever remember watching.  She's basically a fourteen year old girl.And it's only fitting to put Black Hole Sue in a love triangle.  The fianc&eacute; has a high paying job, short and professional hair, a sculpted physique and is the &#34;safe&#34; choice.  Clay is dangerous.  You can tell because he has long hair.  Are such stereotypical love triangles mandated now?  Haven, Once Upon a Time after season one, Witches of East End.... Terrible shows I wouldn't be caught dead watching.The wolves look like the old star wars special effects.  However, that played no part in my rating.If Elena was a secondary character and the series was instead about the Pack, it'd be an interesting show.  It's comical how the show can't go five minutes without everyone obsessing over a chick with the personality of a door knob.  Even the diddler was obsessed with her.The diddler was probably the most interesting character on the show.  I actually found myself rooting for him to slay Clay, Phillip, and especially Elena.  I'm not at all surprised this got a second season.  Just like Once Upon A Time, the worse the writing and acting gets, the more people seem to like it."
"This show is ok but not so compelling that I wanted to watch another episode even for free.  Not sure if it was the actors, the writing, or a combination of the two, but it felt stilted.  Sometimes pretty is not enough and that goes for both genders."
"The acting is not bad.  The story seems to have a lot of potential.  Still, nothing that interesting happens.  Often it is slow, not scary.  The characters are not interesting.  It starts with a sex scene for shock value or simply to entice you to watch.  That is your first sign that the show has little substance.But, worse than all flaws possible, the wolf form is corny and fake!  First of all, it is a wolf form like the ones in Twilight (Oh! I Just vomited).  Effects bring it to life; however they are very fake, cheesy, and distracting.  Furthermore, the werewolf should be humanoid.  Like the ones in the Howling, Underworld, Van Helsing, Wolf Man movies (to name a few).  Nobody wants to follow a glorified dog around for an hour.There is not enough story here to stick around.  If you want to enjoy a werewolf story, try the movies mentioned above or readThe Mammoth Book of Wolf Men,THE ULTIMATE WEREWOLF,Werewolves and Shape Shifters: Encounters with the Beasts Within,The Wolf Gift: The Wolf Gift Chronicles (1).Also, you might likeGinger Snaps,Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed,Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning,An American Werewolf in Paris,An American Werewolf in London,Stephen King's Silver Bullet [HD],  and Cursed with Christina Ricci."
"Having watched the Australian original series, I find it much better and the Australian Rake more authentic than portrayed by Kinnear.  They have made use of the original scripts but with a little bit of their own spin and the episodes having been getting better, but I think this is one show that won't and really should not be renewed."
"get ready for some amazing tv. be prepared to charter waters where no tv show has gone before. meet rake. hes a lawyer, hes a drunk, hes always broke, hes a gambler, he always needs a bath but always scores with the hottest chick in the room, he never does any work but walks into the court room more prepared than a staff of 50 people all who graduated from Harvard law , meet rake. you've never seen anything like this. i hope to never see it again. this show was adapted from an Australian show. isn't every part of this adopted from every tv show ever made? bleh. oh, i forgot to mention the dutiful secretary who never gets paid. dbl bleh."
"I only downloaded the two-minute promo to Rake. It had a few good moments, but I read all of the reviews by those who saw the actual first episode and decided not to download it."
"This Project Runway spinoff stresses all the bad elements of its parent, including the principal one: Angst over Art. In the original Runway, Tim Gunn mentors the designers, who often spat and denigrate each other. Here, Gunn mentors three past Runway participants, who then act as mentor to their own small group of designers. So now the designers can spat, the mentors can spat, and the clothes get moved even farther to the back of the stage. Indeed, Project Runway is all about personal validation, rather than validation of one's art, and it wouldn't be part of the Runway franchise if we didn't have tears and self-pity and pretensions of hipness, which we get in spades this time around. There's an episode of disgusting bullying by people who themselves claim to have been bullied (including one of the mentors), as well as a moment involving a confession of attempted suicide that seems to be nothing but a pathetic bid for sympathy to avoid elimination. Tim Gunn, who has now become a caricature of himself, acquiesces in the bullying, not at all to his credit. Then there are the judges, a second rate trio if there ever was one, including one loud-mouthed person who is nothing but smoke and mirrors. I won't divulge the ultimate winners, of course, but I will say that the show partially redeems itself by selecting correctly at the very end. If you enjoy the slummy aspects of Runway, this will appeal to you. If you hate the fact that Runway is like professional wrestling, then you might want to steer clear."
"Whole family has been a fan of this show since it started. This season it is apparent that the artists are being judged less on their abilities, but more on their 'TV personality.' This has meant the elimination of older artists over those that can't even complete a task, and not having contestants of color ever win a challenge. Worst of all, no one from the show ever, ever, ever responds to the comments from the fan base. This demonstrates a complete lack of caring about us, the viewing audience. We have been buying this program because we ditched our cable company, but this will be the last week."
"There is something about this season that doesn't work for me... the setting all seem low budget, in studio. The fight scenes are worse than any previous season. No attention is being put into making the world feel real, but instead reads like a bad Marvel series...oh no...the end of the world.  Again."
When this show started it was fresh and really good.  Season 4 turned into something really stupid and just not right!  I doubt if it will make it to season 5.
"I was very surprised at how much I didn't like this season. It took all the flaws I had with season 2 and the first five episodes of season 3 and put them together. Note, it'll be hard for you to undertstand my viewpoint as I don't put spoilers in my reviews usually.I found the beginning confusing as it felt like characters had advanced far in their storylines and left us behind. The season felt negative, Bo treated most of her friends like crap espically Kenzi, new characters came up out of nowhere, it felt repetitive, story archs for most characters amounted to nothing, I didn't feel for everyone as much, characters died stupidly, it was a lot harder to marathon this season and it just wasn't as fun as the others.Now there were stuff I enjoyed: I found some plots clever, I loved the eighth episode, I liked where the show took Tamsin and though I'm not a big fan of the ending it was a good way to end the season. But that's about it. Really hoping season 5 redeems this show big time."
"not a terrible movie,but not great. the story line was predictable and the acting mediocre,but pretty scenery.i would not recommend it"
"This is just silly.  Goofy silly, over-gory, sadistic sensationalism. It carries a plot line so thin as to be invisible.  The acting is pretty good, but it really requires you to actively NOT think.  Suspension of disbelief is not enough, you really have to put yourself into an intelligence coma to watch this series.  I would rate it 1 star, but the acting is good."
"I suppose if one falls into the very limited age group targeted by such &#34;entertainment&#34; then it might be considered humorous.  I expect the age group ranges from mature 7 year olds to immature 12 year olds.  Fart detection is a single use comedy ploy, not one to base a series upon."
The story line could be great but is underdeveloped and then bad acting just ruins it.  By the way- the cafeteria at lunch time has more than 20 people in it.  Great actors coupled with Sherlock/encyclopedia brown type inventions by unique set of kids with diff skills would make a great show for a high school setting.
"While I like shows that stress kids using their brains and imagination, I am not  a fan of this show.  Most of the time the actors spoke their lines either so fast or so muffled that I had to back it up to find out what they were saying. I think its a great idea its just the execution that falls flat."
Sophomoric is too grandiose for this series. It is meant for kids. I found it too stupid to watch. The characters seem like cartoon characters.
"Having worked in the animation industry as a composer for 30 years, and more recently as a writer of children's programing, here are my thoughts.The LookIt has a home HD quality to it. I&#8217;m not sure why. The camera lighting/angles? The framing? The color correction/saturation?The ConceptNot at all well established. The name &#8220;Maker Shack Agency&#8221; is not a compelling title and gives no strong clues as to what the show is about without reading the log line. It would have been better to start with the expositional main title sequence showing the boys in the midst of successes and failures with blue flame explosions and fumes pouring out their garage doors - then cut to the cafeteria.Think &#8220;Phil of the Future&#8221; as a model. Along with this, the main title song&#8217;s outlining what&#8217;s to come as well as establishing the character&#8217;s relationships would have gone a long way to set the context and sustain the opening of the show.The CurriculumA science show for sure but, the underpinnings are more intended to be humorous than inspirational, if barely functional. I&#8217;m never in favor of base potty jokes, so their &#8220;fart detector&#8221; was a demographically marketable add on for me.On the other hand, imagine if Wolfie had very bad gas and was about to go out on a date. How much funnier it would have been for him to invent and use a &#8220;fart canceling machine&#8221; while trying to conceal the device in the car. Out of his control it would have been &#8220;farts gone wild&#8221;.His date, &#8220;Wolfie, what&#8217;s that box. Is that a new invention of yours? Oh&#8230; you are soooo smart. Can I see it? What does it DO!?&#8221;The audience would know as does Wolfie, that the instant he loses control of the box a methane disaster awaits! The struggle between them and Wolfie&#8217;s lame excuses as to just why she can&#8217;t see the box would have been ripe for side gripping humor&#8211;especially if she lurches and grabs it out of his hands and fiddles with the knobs! Now theirs a scene that really stinks for you!So, the &#8220;science gone wild&#8221; was pallid for me as no invention, real or imagined solved any worldly problems. It&#8217;s &#8220;Flubber&#8221; with teens at the helm with the steering wheel missing.Plot / Story ArcIt seems as if the main plot, the Maker Shack, was the subplot. The focus was not clear as the &#8220;science&#8221; aspect was secondary to &#8220;teens revenge&#8221; themes and a preoccupation with farting. As for plot focus, think &#8220;Weird Science&#8221; for a parallel teen adventure movie.As a teen SitCom the humor that DID NOT involve farts was itself very self conscious. And though I am clearly out of THAT demographic, having been schooled by my own teenage daughters, I found the set-ups predictable with a few exceptions.Then, given the obesity epidemic, I was troubled by a plot that involved a candy baron and&#8230; a candy peddler in the school&#8217;s cafeteria. That CANDY drove the storyline is a real negative in children&#8217;s media. Consider: Cookie Monster has been switched to broccoli!([...])That is certainly an indication that this is not the proper &#8220;teen sweet spot&#8221; (industry term) and is the wrong plot motivation for a teen&#8217;s show in this health conscious day and age.The CharactersFor me, the most serious problem is the lead, Wolfie, who if properly cast could have held the show more together. He lacked the over-the-top energy and charisma necessary to pull off some of the antics. His emotional tachometer seemed to idle at 2500 rpm throughout the show. The other characters seem more like stereotypical set pieces.The MusicIndy rock I suppose? Usually mixed WAY TOO LOW. As a backdrop to the action it was one-dimensional and struggled to comment on the humor and antics.A Note on SoundPoor production sound and mic-ing hurt the dialogue. The room tone was uneven and the dialogue seemed at a distance. Further, the &#8220;walla&#8221;(BKG chatter), street and cafeteria backgrounds were not handled well leaving many scenes unnaturally quiet and bare.ConclusionIn this technological hi-tech age, the show never reached for the their inventions &#8220;wow factor&#8221;. It relied on more primitive wires and batteries, blinking lights and a laptop. The audience for this show will become much more interested if it can come up the something that looks like real awesome breakthroughs that gets the job done along with a boatload of clever set-ups and humor."
"This show had potential, but it's like no one was paying attention to the final product. The production value seems really low, and the acting is not that great. There is a great idea here; inspiring kids and getting them into makerspace culture. It's too bad this didn't come out better."
"I really liked the idea of getting kids thinking about inventions and how things work, but then the rest of the show talks down to them with low-brow humor. The timing or editing was also off. It was like watching a high school play where everyone was assigned a part without having auditions. There are some good child actors in the cast with potential and the idea of the maker subculture sounds great. Keep the projects realistic and don't dumb it down with toilet humor and it could be saved."
This show is not going to get anything but some very bored flies .I don't like the script and the kids were bored.
Not really something my family would watch. But it was ok. May find an audience of young kids that would like it.
"After the last episode where the studio couldn't even do proper research on military uniforms and dressed their soldiers in Marine uniforms, the show lost points with me (I know most people don't know the difference nor do they care, but I do).  This week's story line left me so disinterested I turned it off after 15 minutes and deleted the program from my watchlist.  The characters also have not developed much depth. There's no chemistry for me."
"This has all the elements that you'd expect in a toddler show, and our four year old enjoyed it.  I'm just not sure the moral story of &#34;wishing&#34; is something I want my kid to see.  I'd much rather teach imagination or creating something rather than &#34;wishing&#34; for it."
"Ugh, can we please move beyond girls with sparkly wands?  It's 2014 and it's about time we shatter gender stereotypes."
"Having worked in the animation industry as a composer for 30 years, and more recently as a writer of children's programing, here are my thoughts.The Show&#8217;s LookMy feeling is that the show may have been more visually accessible in 2D or 2 1/2 D of Flash. Audiences today are use to Dreamwork's quality CGI. In 2D, it may have had a warmer and looser feel. Without the detailed rigging necessary, the facial expressions and body motions were a bit stiff for me.The ConceptI&#8217;m concerned for younger audiences that the work necessary to make REAL achievements in life are short changed with the Wish&#8217;N&#8217;Poof concept. Young minds are not able to distinguish well between &#8220;real&#8221; reality and what is presented in children&#8217;s entertainment. Thus the lesson of hard work, and discipline is lost.Creating a false relationship with an on-screen character also has been a concern from Dr. Dimitri Christakis at Washington University where talking out the screen (the 4th wall) creates an unreal interaction with the onscreen characters. For example, Bianca, &#8220;Would you like to make a wish with me&#8221;. Young viewer &#8221;I can&#8217;t, I have to go potty first&#8221; Bianca &#8221;Great! less do it together&#8221;. Though a possible humorous exchange, questions should NOT be directed for a response. Here&#8217;s an example. Bianca as she looks out the screen to the audience &#8220;I&#8217;m gong to help him with a big wish&#8221;. It remains engaging but in not a &#8220;Dora the Explorer &#8220;Will you help me?&#8221; &#8211; then, a long beat and screen silence &#8220;Great&#8221;The CurriculumI&#8217;m not sure what it was &#8211; (SEL) Social Emotional Learning? This would be the brief segment were Bianca helps her friend to perform on stage.Additionally, I was concerned that, in this episode at least, it was all about achieving glamor and rockstar status. This culture has enough &#8220;Brittany Spears&#8221; and &#8220;Justin Biebers&#8221; to last us into the next century.Is it educationally appropriate or instructive to wish a horse to be still on her friend&#8217;s head? Wouldn&#8217;t understanding the forces of gravity be a better lesson?  The latest survey shows the United States in 37th in STEM (Math, Technology, Science and Engineering). Add to this that 25% of the U.S. population thinks the sun goes around the earth. Well&#8230; you get my point.Maybe Bianca and her &#8220;WishNpoof&#8221; will make her WANT do her homework or clean her room. And, I meant that seriously and not facetiously or in a snarky way. Some kind of proactive behavior kids can emulate and parents will love as well.The CharactersNo one has a strong POV. It seems like Bianca, her mother, and her friends goals are listless without strong motivations for what they want. Lastly the Teddy bear as a comic relief device is probably miscast. He looks like Ted from the movie. As a child&#8217;s plush toy, he&#8217;s a though-a-way rather than cute and lovable. His relationship to Bianca, in my view, should be sweet, loving and supportive like a puppy. In that context, he can still make comments on the action but it will not look as if it&#8217;s coming from and &#8220;outside&#8221; observer.The MusicNot clear in intention and searching for a theme.ConclusionI don&#8217;t think there is much substance here in the &#8220;Wish&#8217;N&#8217;Poof&#8221; concept. The thought of 13 to 26 episodes of Wishing and Poofing things into existence has to be limited in its scope.Understandably &#8220;Out of the Blue&#8220; has a strong track record with &#8220;Super Why&#8221;. But there, the underlying educational concept is a solid one &#8211; READING. What could be more fun than to change a story by putting a NEW word and saving the day for characters in distress in a book. Little heroes!Though cute however, and in many ways endearing, I believe Wish&#8217;N&#8217;Poof is adding to the culture of instant gratification. With a WISH and then a POOF, how will this show empower children&#8217;s lives?  What are the valuable life lessons?  I&#8217;m not sure?"
"OK, so Chris Carter is behind this; that's no guarantee of quality. The action sequences are well done, and the premise isn't bad, but as is so often the case with science-fiction/horror, the characters are stereotypical and do really unbelievable things. At the beginning of this, five people are stuck in an elevator. What would you do if you got stuck in an elevator? Would you, within two or three minutes, begin to panic and think about climbing out the hatch in the ceiling? I doubt it; I think you'd be patient a bit longer than that. But not these people. They immediately begin to panic. And their default mode of communicating with each other? Sniping and carping, of course, because that's the way cardboard characters behave in way too many mediocre screenplays. No one behaves reasonably when they can instead immediately begin to criticize and judge each other. It's just the same kind of characters we've seen in a thousand other movies -- whether Chris Carter is behind them or not."
"This was basically the show Revolution immediately after the blackout with a Sci-Fi/Religous twist.  I was expecting so much more, but this left me sadly disappointed.  The only Pilot for 2014 that I would not watch if it went into production."
"The After was a real disappointment.  It is full of plot cliches and trite writing.  The characters are shallow and uninteresting, and the little surprise at the end of the first episode is probably not enough to get me back for the second episode.  We might try it one more time, but I'm not sure."
"The characters seemed a bit contrived to me... the cop next to incompetent... The angel in the rough call girl who decides to go for a swim in the nude during the apocalypse ??,... Etc. etc..  And the other characters are just as deep...with the exception of the heroine that we meet right away, and maybe the convict, who unfortunately fails initially to mention that the apocalypse is going on outside...All in all, not a must watch for me, but it has potential I think if they don't take so many shortcuts to try and make it interesting.."
"First, I don't watch much sci-fy television, but I was willing to give it a shot.  The characters didn't exactly beg you to like them.  None of them seemed too interesting. Lots of stereotyping. That being said, I have to admit to being curious about the identical birth dates, the odd tattoos, and the strangely interesting &#34;alien&#34; forest creature.Would be willing to watch a second episode to see if the characters grow at all and make you want to watch them. Hopefully the show will take a couple of steps forward."
"When I saw Chris Carter was involved, I decided to give it a try. This pilot was so poorly written, I was really surprised. Excessive use of the F word and a girl deciding to take a nude swim on the first day of the apocalypse was just in very poor taste. If the writing continues like this, it's gonna take more than a little nudity to save this show. It was just confusing overall, but maybe a second episode can redeem this weak pilot."
Saw the Pilot. For most part it dragged. Don't see why there was so much cursing. It was simply distracting. Silly encounters such as pointing gun at guard to get him to open the hotel door. Don't this this will survive.
"I don't like trying to watch a show that's so dark it's hard to see what's happening.  That's what this show was. Also, starting to seem like &#34;Lost&#34; and that didn't go anywhere.  I'd hate to invest time in another show like that.Can't say I'd recommend this show."
"No one wanted to believe it, but it's obvious that Chris Carter is pretty much done as a creative mind. Similar to Kohan/Mutchnick, there's no diversity in the storytelling, so all we remember is that one hit. Just finished it, would not watch this anymore.Usually pilots can have a slow build and get stronger. This started strong and got worse. Get Aldis Hodge and Adrian Pasdar better vehicles please. Pass."
"will probably not watch it unless they to tone down the &#34;F&#34; words, i suspect they won't so it will be just another piece of trash"
"I liked the premise of the show, but the writing was pretty bad. So many bad clique stuff that is over used, and over done. I felt like I was struggling to make it through the episode. I think with some re-working it could be a good show, but I honestly don't see it going beyond this pilot episode.The actors where a mix of good and bad. Overall a disappointment."
"I barely got through the first episode... I felt like I'd been down this road before, and that there was nothing new to be discovered. Very thin on story I thought, so I'll just have to watch a couple more to see if this improves or I just give up on it. The show has some potential, but I think it's boxed itself into a corner story wise."
Not thrilled with this show. I love Scifi but was disappointed with how this show played out. I probably won't watch this program if it makes it. I lost interest quickly.
I liked the start. As soon as they got in the elevator it started to lose me and I never recovered.
"As an X-Files fan, I expected a lot more from Chris Carter. This pilot just didn't deliver. The casting is weak for the most part, the only actor I really like is Aldis Hodge (from his work on TNT's Leverage.) The writing was weak and did not engage me at all. Really wanted this to be better. Oh well."
Personally - I like these types of story lines.  This did not hold my attention and dragged on in my opinion.  Plot development lacked in keeping my interest.  I didn't understand what happened- then the alien- makes no sense all 8 wouldn't have some type of urgency for their families or loved ones - not realistic at all
the majority of the show consist of extras walking into each other in circles on a street were that many people wouldn't ever be at one time and the main characters not knowing why
"I love sci-fi/suspense but I felt this story and dialog was more geared for a 12 year old than adults. It is as if the screen writer(s) tried their best to sprinkle in curse words as often as possible.The character line-up was text-book from most any other end-of-the-word drama that has come before. Not one original or realistic character in the bunch. It is like politically correct Hollywood. They made sure the show included racial tension, bigots, alternate lifestyles, mom, rich, poor, successful, drunk, violent mix like all shows like this do.As many shows seem to do these days, they make the cops out as weak idiots. I'm no police officer but I could not accept/believe in the cop characters in this story. The writers should have spent some time in the field getting to know the jobs of each character before they attempt to write a screen play with them. At lease the show &#34;Leverage&#34; makes fun of cops in a campy and fun manner.***spoiler*** I'm sure the scene where a woman, during a dangerous apocalypses, decides to unwind by taking a nude swim in front of total strangers and then talk to the violent drunk stalker about the biblical book of revelation before jumping out is considered believable by most viewers but I could not help but laugh.Overall this show felt like &#34;Lost 2.0&#34; but was more predictable."
"... and I never watched much of Lost. Interesting idea, but too many &#34;odd&#34; connections and the like for my taste"
"Gimmicky.  That&#8217;s X files, American Horror Story, Lost, John Doe, 666 Park Avenue, and many other single season supernatural mystery series in a nutshell.  In X files, the actors were good, and we played along as the plotlines become convoluted and ridiculous because we figured Chris Carter had an end game in mind.  In retrospect, he didn&#8217;t, and X files was conspiracy theory for the sake of conspiracy theory and we were left with a sentient oil slick.  In Lost, the reason the number sequence was magical was never explained, and that&#8217;s a MAJOR point of the series.  If this was a miniseries I would absolutely watch it, but as a tv series that Chris Carter will try to stretch out for a dozen seasons, maybe even replacing Aldis Hodge with Robert Patrick as he goes along&#8230; I don&#8217;t think so.  The birthdays, the tattoos, the last five minutes&#8230; I&#8217;m not curious about how it will all fit together because Chris Carter has learned that it doesn&#8217;t matter if it fits together or not.  People will watch as long as you keep the mystery of aliens dangling from a fishing line just out of reach.  Despite my preconceptions and how transparently manipulative the pilot seems, I would give this series a chance.  Who knows, maybe Chris Carter actually has a coherent plot in mind and isn't making everything up as he goes along."
"I forced myself to watch the entire episode. It made little sense and irritated me.Recycled actors. I've never been so uninterested in a Sharon Lawrence role, and I really like her.Not many special effects, considering it's a Syfy show. The closing credits had the most visual appeal.Too linear. Might have been more interesting had they used flashbacks. Also, the sets were bland and generic. You need more than some litter and smoke to portray a realistic apocalyptic mood.Still, I gave it 2 stars because I really have seen worse, I think."
"Outside of two characters, this acting in this show seems very forced.  As if they're acting that they're acting...if that makes sense.  Bad directing or writing leaves characters decision making presented as simply unbelievable.  Maybe the bad acting had something to do with that.  Overall I had high hopes for this series, and maybe with a complete overall of cast and better budget something more entertaining can be achieved."
Perhaps fans of the gone but never-understood (by me) series &#34;Lost&#34; will have fun trying to decipher it but I can guarantee I won't be.
"While this pilot had a few good moments, it just didn't grab my interest.  I may not be the right audience as I tend to like a little more action...faster pace.  I also didn't get invested in any of the characters...care about them and the problems they face.  If only one pilot can make it, there are others up for review that I would prefer over this one."
"I really wasn't pulled into this show. It took far too long to set up the story and the only reason I didn't turn away was because I enjoy supporting Amazon Prime Pilot season and giving my feedback. Plus, I was too lazy to go searching for something else to watch. The characters were OK, but I found some of them way too cliched. Like the Mr. Ireland character who drank and cursed like a sailor. How original? I wasn't sure why the main actress was French either, seeing as it's set in the US and doesn't add anything to the show. The stronger leads were the established actors like Sharon Lawrence, Aldis Hodge and, surprisingly, Jamie Kennedy. There were things about the story that made no sense like the loss of time from when they entered the elevator to when they escaped. Why the hotel security guy was able to be paid off for taking the French actress up to her hotel room? If it's really the end of the world, what good is money? Also, why was no one allowed up to their hotel room, and all the floors were empty but the lobby was overrun with guests coming and going? Where were they coming from? Little details like that really bother me. Anyway, back to the concept of the show. I'm not sure what the concept is to be honest. It's not clearly spelled out in the pilot what is happening, or what the goal is of all these characters thrown together. Are they going to be living in that huge mansion together, or off in the woods? How will they survive? Is this an alien invasion or terrorism? Either way, I simply don't care. And that's the sad part! I don't really care enough about these characters to tune back in. I've seen far better shows over the years that have successfully set up their concept and established likeable characters from the beginning with a mix of action, suspense, comedy, and drama, such as: Sliders, Torchwood, The X-Files, Eureka, and Supernatural to name a few; so I'm not interested in wasting my time here. This was a dud to me."
"I would really, really, like to know why! Why are these type of shows, i.e., end of the world, almost end of the world, alien invasion, mysterious unexplained power loss, the devil and his minions land on earth, type of shows, are so poorly written.  The end of civilization is upon us, but it takes, what several episodes, for the main characters to get their heads screwed on straight.  Please, this is an outrage. One would think, objectively that, at least the cop, would be clear headed enough to realize that  ""it"" has hit the fan and security, like closing and securing the metal gate behind them would be important. Why not?  What, because all people are basically good?  Really! No thoughts on how to counter brute force when necessary, and yes, in this situation it would be instantly necessary to counter brute force.  The takers are everywhere and need only a small opportunity to revert to type.  No thoughts on security-totally lame, no organizing; assessing and gathering food, water, weapons, ammunition, proper  clothing, shoes, you know the basics, in an end of the world scenario would be first priority in this situation.  The only characters with credibility are the old woman and the black man.  I can only hope, probably without good reason, based on what I have seen so far in this pilot, that this show, if any more are filmed, will be any better written.  Try again, next time with a believable storyline, please.djh"
"Terrorist, plague, aliens, zombies? After being trapped with a group of people in a parking garage the lady who escapes finds herself standing in the middle of hundreds of people running in all directions? From what? Where are they going? Why are some running this way and some running that way? She doesn't ask. Her only concern is to get back to her hotel room to get her cell phone. The lady in question is the best of the group - acting wise - and deserves a better script. There are a few good moments but not enough to keep me interested."
I wanted to try out Amazons new shows and I think this one is my least favorite of them all ...
"Starts off with an interesting premise, but gets very weird toward the end of the pilot. Let's just skip this one."
Most of this show is about a group of people freaking out about being locked in a parking garage. There's a little scifi at the end but it wasn't worth waiting for.
"I'm not a big fan of the &#34;strangers thrown together under mysterious circumstances&#34; show. With the exception of Lost most of them are just tedious(see The Nine, Drive, The Langoliers). This show, unfortunately, falls in the tedious camp.A group of &#34;random&#34; people including a French actress(?), a clown, a kvetchy rich woman, a tough hispanic female cop and the angry brother from Heroes are trapped in a building when apparently Godzilla or something has destroyed LA. For some reason once they get out they all go to the rich ladies house to play her Wii Universe or something. Somehow they all find out that they were born on the same date and then.... Yeah I know enough already. I don't care either.This is easily the weakest of this years Pilot Season with clunky writing and direction and uninteresting characters."
"I was excited to see something new from Chris Carter and immediately watched this pilot.  It started out relatively interesting, even looking past the clich&eacute; everyone's-trapped-in-an-elevator plot device, particularly the added clich&eacute; of including one of each possible personality type and demographic.Worse yet, the old-age make-up they applied to the younger actress playing Francis (the elderly female character) is terrible.As for plot, character development, and overall storytelling, I was underwhelmed.  Practically nothing of worth happens in the entire episode.(Itsy bitsy spoilers ahead)The show opens with our rag-tag group of people trapped in the aforementioned elevator, then trapped in a parking garage before they finally make it out due to some cringe-worthy plot devices (the self-proclaimed innocent fugitive comes back for everyone despite having held them all at gunpoint only an hour earlier.The riot we see over the ambulance they've commandeered is ridiculous, but what's more ridiculous is the fact that they expect us to believe that although the unruly mob was rage-filled enough to nearly tip the vehicle on their way out, they did nothing as it made its way in?  What??Let's move on.  Things happen, revelations occur, heavy-handed Biblical references emerge, stereotypical thugs cause trouble, a French woman cries, and Chris Carter shows us all how terrible he is at directing when he's out of practice.This episode was directed as if an art student was behind the camera.  One with a C-grade average.  The cuts are odd and abrupt, the shots are awkward, the attempts to mask low budget's limitations with camera trickery get lazier and lazier.  The ending of the episode (which I won't share) feels forced.  Like Chris was writing the episode and thought, ""Oh s***...nothing's happened and it's still not interesting.  I'd better throw in something really effing weird.""  And that's just what he did.Perhaps the story will pan out in the long run, but I have lost interest in seeing the next chapter.  The bad plot development, clich&eacute; characters who act uncharacteristically (the escort skinny dips then gets mad that the sleaze ball is watching her??  HUHHH??), extremely terrible directing...all these things come together to make a perfect storm of ""Never mind."""
"So, I'm excited to see works from Chris Carter and I love Sci-Fi BUT I crave ""Intelligent"" writing. Everyone has seen this ""type"" of movie where the world ends etc.....zzzzz gets old fast. They need to jump into the creepy, science fiction aspect of why the events were taking place (instead of the focus on scenes of and people's stupid/irrational behavior) to make this show unique and different. They hinted at it but it's filled with boring human behavior!(*cough: I can watch ""The Walking Dead"" for that same crap). The other issue that warrants a 2 star review is the characters: they are shallow and predictable. Also, I am so TIRED of seeing the same old actor: Adrian Pasdar in every show from HERO's to the 4400. Geez..like there isn't any clean cut American guy type actors out there who could bring a new face for me to look at. Don't get me wrong, I like Adrian Pasdar for his accomplishments but bored of seeing him in almost EVERYTHING..Sci-Fi. Hire an original, Please!!! We want NEW FACES!! I encourage Amazon's attempts to compete with Netflix for original material but this is not it.."
"Loved the X-Files and was really hoping for another well-written show with great characters and great writing...this wasn't it. It's a bunch of unlikable people dropping the F-bomb every other word and making dumb decisions. The ending was definitely a shocker, but not enough here to bring me back."
"Of the 5 new Amazon pilots this was, by far, my least favourite.  I rated the show exactly what it deserved.  Do not waste your time watching this pilot as the other 4 new pilots are winners in my opinion."
Lousy beyond belief but I'll probably keep watching out of a morbid sense of curiosity. I guess THE AFTER qualifies as camp.
"It really had no story...no character knew what was going on. The security guard at the hotel said it might be the end of the world, but then still robbed the french women? What? The Beverly Hills gang members wanting to rob the vault? I mean why not just shack up in the mansion? No one has turned on a radio? Kinda s***ty.Spoiler alert....Am I suppose to think that is a demon cause of the horns and the chick mentioning revelation? That's weak. The tattoo thing makes no sense. A demon for people born on March 7th? I mean they set up so little of the story here it didn't leave me wanting more, it left me wondering why I watched it."
"The characters seem to be stereotypical and there are too many of them. The premise of the show seems good but it's very unclear and unfocused. There are weird creatures, mass amnesia, loud sounds that break glass once in a while, selective power outages, strangely locked doors, and an unclear timeline. If there was more orginization instead of the producers trying to throw every scenario into a 50 minute time frame, the show would be successful."
The After held my attention mostly because I was confused and had to see what was happening. It felt all over the place for me--and only one or two of the characters were actually bearable. I would be interested to continue watching if they work on the dialogue and make the story focus more on the actual reason it's all happening
"Dont waste your time with this one.  I kept waiting for the thing to get better....to give us a hint on whats going on .....whats causing all of the turmoil.  And then at the very end of the first episode, you more or less are given a big hint....disappointing."
"There are too many scenarios that just don't seem realistic:* why would all those people try to topple the ambulance ... and from both sides?* what happened to all the people who were in the road and at the front of the ambulance before he moved forward? They suddenly disappeared, and not one person was run over during the escape. Right.* the road was wide open for them to drive right out of a business center into a residential neighborhood .. this was a workday obviously, and everyone would be trying to get to loved ones.* obviously some serious shtf, and none of these retards stops to think for a second about security? Just leave the gate open. Hell the show doesn't even let us know if it's open or not.Suspension of disbelieve was broken so many times, I couldn't stand to watch another episode."
Lacking something...not a good start kind of confusing! I will not watch this again! Really do not have anything else to say!
"diverse characters forced to work together to survive... ok, interesting premise.  however the lack of a plausible disaster (crowds milling around aimlessly with no power is not a disaster) and other silly plotting made this unwatchable.  fair acting and character development and some very lazy writing."
"In fairness, I didn't watch past the first 15 minutes because I found it to be reminiscent of network programming. In my opinion the storyline was ordinarily and the acting was so- so."
"I can see why people would enjoy this pilot, so definitely take this with a grain of salt. It's free, so you may as well decide for yourself.That said, I felt the whole thing was overplayed. The notion that some mysterious disaster takes place, causing people to take to the streets and freak out as the next loud occurrence plays out may be realistic, but it's also a haggard film trope. Then, you get a group of strangers who are drawn together in the midst of all this, each with a tattoo that seemingly bears relevance to their situation. You get the weird, vaguely human creature that contorts its limbs in seemingly impossible ways (and could easily be seen crawling on the ceiling in a Japanese horror flick). The characters were especially poor representations of humanity IMO as well. Talk about every conceivable socal and racial cliche, all bundled together into a group of seven people.What I really thought was that Chris Carter was trying too hard to be relevant. The production was great, the cast was approachable enough (if you ignore the terrible cliches), the scenery was vivid....it just suffered from being a boring rehash of so many other stories out there. A solid pass for me personally.Carter should be trying to write something original rather than steal from every popular movie/television trope."
"Full disclosure I didn't make it all the way through this show. I had to stop at 28 minutes and 21 seconds when the &#34;car alarm scene&#34; returned. I wanted to like this show, but I didn't. The characters seemed strange. A clown, a cop, an escaped con, a lawyer, a hooker, a surly Englishman, a sick old lady, and a struggling actress/ mom are trapped in a parking garage with a car alarm, when some sort of Apocalyptic event occurs. Will our scrappy band of misfits be able to put aside their differences to escape?  I didn't care , the car alarm worked on my last nerve at the previously mentioned time. I also found it creepy when the guy dressed as a clown was leering at the hot girls legs. Also when the surly Englishman was perving on her legs as well. I recommend the Walking Dead, Fringe, or World War Z  if  you want some Apocalypse action."
"I had high hopes that this would be ""must see"" from the get go, but I'm not overly impressed so far! The story has a mixed bag of scenario's that are at work here with equal parts religion, alien, apocalyptic, survivor meets birthday club with French and Irish dressing added.The survivor cast and their personalities do little to help me either like many of them or make me want to cheer them on. I have grown tired of the type casting many of these stories rely on to make/keep things interesting with the annoying, dumb and geriatric  people you just want to be killed off or thrown off the set.For those who are concerned with the shows content let me just say there was enough F words thrown out in one scene to cover the entire episode. The violence was fairly mild and we were presented with some shots of partial nudity from both sexesI am by no means writing off this story because of Carter's talent and it was only the pilot episode, but again the cast and their personalities are a turn off for me. I am in the minority on my review of this show, but I truly feel it needs some serious tweaking to make it a ""must see"" series. 2 Generous stars."
"The challenge with The After is that I have watched Lost, FlashForward, Invasion, Under the Dome, The X Files, Millennium, etc. This path of a group of random, odd people thrown together when some outside, supernatural force impacts our lives has been done before and a show must execute perfectly on the concept to not feel stale. This felt stale and uneven. It was interesting not knowing what was going on, but there were a ton of logic flaws with how things were being handled. The chaos outside of the parking garage seemed contrived and unbelievable. Had a day already past without communications, there would have been better organization and people would not have been walking around like zombies. It made for a nice visual picture, but was unbelievable. Also, if a day had past outside, why was it never addressed again? Shouldn't more time have past when our protagonist returned to the garage? The acting was good and the show looked spectacular, but the story needs help. It will either veer into the corny, logic problem realm, in which case I will watch one more episode and be done OR it will pull itself together and take us on a nice ride. Lets hope it is the latter."
Things I love about the show:Characters from various backgroundsThat it seems to be going more toward the supernatural side rather than the zombie side of things. &#34;The After&#34; please don't make these things zombies. I'm so tired of zombies.I do like the suspense and how it plays out.Things I hate about the show:The F-word is said every other sentence for this show. I mean....I am not opposed the word. In any sense but when its not character appropriate it just doesn't make sense. I mean my favorite movie is Boondock saints and I thought that was tame compared to the amount of F-bombs they use in this show. Its appropriate for the irish and the convict character It really doesn't fit anyone else to say it. /endrantOther than that it looks like it has potential
"Apocalyptic shows are becoming a bit tired and this show doesn't really offer much new until the final revelation at the end. However, by that point I was so annoyed by the cast that I didn't want to spend any more time with them. The one person who seemed like I could root for (the French woman) became so laughably transfixed on having her cell phone that it was hard to take her seriously any more.Also, the show did a lousy job of explaining why things went awry. For most of the show, it seemed like people were just going crazy because the power went out. I know us Angelenos wild out when it rains but I don't think chaos would ensue after a power outage like this; nor do I understand why two helicopters would crash into each other because of it.In the end, this just feels like another &#34;Lost&#34; rip-off, which is a huge problem for a company trying to break into original programming since &#34;Lost&#34; rip-offs started getting tired more than a few years ago.Unless Amazon decides to pander to the religious demographic and really push that angle hard, I don't see any reason to pick this show up."
The first 20 minutes you patiently wait and hope...the next 20 minutes you wonder why you are still watching it and the last 20 you are just laughing.  It's really really bad.  I mean...BAD.  Their is a character in the show that they call OLD LADY the whole show...never during the hours spent or even going to her house do they exchange names.  At the beginning they have an &#34;escape convict&#34; who's dialogue was him just reading his character bio sheet.  Sad Sad Sad Sad Sad
"the beginning of the show is fantastic, but then it turns out to be a walking dead with aliens, one episode is not enough to know what is it going to be about, i think that is a mistake. The characters are very shallow and the pilot ends without an emotional cliffhanger, so i dont think its going to last more than a season"
"This pilot starts out pretty good, but soon the language gets so bad it ruins the whole episode. I won't give it the ending, but I'm really not into that stuff. I won't be watching any additional episodes."
It was just too childish to keep my attention.  It a series I will pass up. I can't see it being successful
"Chris Carter loves to film events that are bizarre and inexplicable.  The problem is, there is never a purpose, explanation, or context for the events that are taking place.  We are supposed to hope that if we just keep watching long enough something will become clear.  I wouldn't bet on it.  In order for me to enjoy scifi, there has to be some purpose or concept or framework to put everything in perspective.  Just an endless portrayal of the bizarre and inexplicable isn't enough.  I'm sure that Amazon can come up with some better concept for a scifi show than this."
"I liked the premise of the story, but I didn't like the incessant swearing. I also didn't care much for the stereotypes."
"It turned out to be a jumble of elements we've seen before in this genre ... an odd assortment of characters (one from Column A, two from Column B, and so on) trapped in an unexplained disaster that stays unexplained for the longest time. Needs to go somewhere."
"Well, the beginning is compelling and spurs a lot of curiosity.  The characters are mildly interesting, and the actors do quite well.  The ending is a horrific pay-off that leaves you wide-eyed and ready for another episode.  NOT because the characters are anything special, but because we FINALLY get a reason to pay attention.  FINALLY some these boring people might be killed.The problem?  A drawn-out, confusing, frustratingly-stupid-at-times, middle.  Tons of chaos.  But we do not know why.  People everywhere, clambering and rushing and gawking (at nothing), but no one will say anything of value.  They just HAVE TO get out of their buildings.  Why?  No one is hurt.  Then people form mobs for no reason and attack an emergency vehicle.  Not crazed or sick or possessed or zombified people, mind you.  No.  Yuppies and working folk milling about.Police act unrealistically.  Firemen act unrealistically.  They are rushing around to help people, but never help people.  LOL.Another stupid lapse in logic (Possible Minor Spoiler): The main group of people get &#34;trapped&#34; in a parking garage by a flimsy gate that they can LIFT WITH A JACK!  They do so to let two people out.  Then give up on jacks because the first jack loses its grip.  Dozens of jacks in dozens of cars behind them, but . . . no.  Not to mention the fact that there are two-ton vehicles they can hotwire and drive THROUGH the gate.  But no.And MOST LAUGHABLE OF ALL, two helicopters crash FOR . . . NO . . . CONCEIVABLE . . . REASON.  Just to press the fact that life is somehow now chaotic.  Like the writers are saying, &#34;Hey, things are getting whacky, guys!  See that?  Stay tuned!  Keep watching while we figure out what the hell we're doing!&#34;So, we just follow a group of people who stick together for no reason, do not try to get to their loved ones, yap and argue and fret, while who-knows-what is going on.  Very annoying.IF you even make it to the end, something weird happens that promises a new world kind of like the Walking Dead on steroids.  But I have to say, I have VERY little faith that these writers will turn it into anything watchable.  Boredom seems to be their specialty.My suggestion is for you to watch until you get bored, then fast forward to the last ten minutes to see the . . . weird thing."
"Because hating something takes somes level of involvement or passion. The characterization was god awful. Somehow, I keep thinking these stereotypical roles were done on purpose, but I just don't care enough to figure out why. I can't say I'd never watch it. Like a train wreck, sometimes you can't help yourself, but this would be at the bottom of my viewing queue."
"Could be a great series, but seriously, every third work is the F-word. If you can't communicate without that word, then you can't communicate.  It kills this series."
"The pilot was a little frantic, jumping around more to fulfill the &#34;hook&#34; requirements of a pilot than to dig into a serious plot. The usual quick collection of characters suggests that every episode will be obligated to follow each one of them, even if some play no real part in the series' story arc for a while. This gets weary, as viewers usually can recognize the fatigue of the writer(s) as they labor to fulfill the requirements of the series bible. What concerns me more, however, is that the whole presentation is so reminiscent of that weird tradition of &#34;mysterious&#34; TV series -- namely to tantalize us for season after season without ever really going anywhere. One fears that even if it gets addictive (with gimmicks like tossing in the alien/demon/whatever at the end of S1E1), the payoff may never arrive (especially if the thing is canceled prematurely). In such cases, trying to figure out what the heck was going on turns out to be a waste of time.This may not be one of those frustrating productions, and it may have a long, interesting story to tell, but the pilot doesn't give us much to go on. There really isn't any &#34;story&#34; beyond a puzzling situation, with a surprise &#34;third element&#34; to sweeten the mystery at the end. That's why I'm afraid I'm about to be spoon fed one tidbit of revelation per episode, and the big backstory that would explain everything and make sense out of it all might not even exist. The best of this genre tell a gripping story in each episode, wrapped in a plausible and equally gripping series arc, but this one hasn't done that yet. I haven't written it off, but the pilot has me coming back almost exclusively just for &#34;what happens next.&#34; If that's all it's got to keep me coming back, then that's not enough."
"Almost an hour of: power is out, no communications, people panic, rule of law by gun and wallet - wow, how to totally unpredictable, novel and riveting - it has been done better before, X-Files creator or not, this was near to very bad.Then in the last 3 minutes, we are introduced to what looks like an orange eyed horned blue skinned alien with too many tattoo's to be considered in good taste and that gets shot and scurries off into the woods like an up facing spider...the only 3 minutes worth watching in this drone.This is so confused it is not worth another episode...however, keep the cinematographer, he/she was not bad at all - same with the tattoo artist."
"I wanted to like this pilot. I wanted to believe that Chris Carter had another great idea in him outside of the X-Files. If that is true, this isn't it. This show is basically Lost, The Nine, Flash Forward, and Revolution all mixed up in to a really crappy show. If your idea of a good time is a bunch of confused characters yelling at each other for an hour, then you might enjoy it. Otherwise, keep looking elsewhere for your next genre TV fix."
"I'm not a prude...and I like the occasional &#34;F&#34; word as well as the next person...but geez...I couldn't follow the dialogue for ducking all of the F bombs being tossed about.  Really is it necessary? For that very reason I don't think I'd watch another episode....and I'm sorry about that too cause I LOVED the XFiles think Chris Carter is excellent. Oh well, not this time."
"I love sci-fi and really liked the X-files. It seemed the characters were fighting a bad script on this one .  So many plot holes and logical inconsistency.  Actually kind of frustrating to watch. It was like the old Three's Company episodes where everything could have been cleared up in the first scene if someone had just told the whole truth. I tend to like sci-fi movies and shows BECAUSE the protagonist is the smartest person in the room.  They would do what you would want them to do, because it makes sense.  So many things happened in this show that didn't make sense.  Not in a mysterious ""LOST: what is the black smoke?"" kind of way, but in a frustrating people acting completely stupid kind of way.Hopefully the pilot was just trying to jump start some good writers and character development."
"In what appears to make an attempt to be 'Lost 2014' this show is somewhat of a let down.  First off, folks so easily accepted that there were suddenly thrust into &#34;the end of all things&#34; yet the still clamored over cash money, electronic devices with no way to power them and silly conversation.What a disaster of a pilot from Chris Carter, the mastermind behind X-files."
"The concept is appealing but the execution is unimpressive.  Weird coincidences abound while unlikely &#34;lucky breaks&#34; derail the plot and take me out of the story.  As for the twist at the end of the episode, it almost feels like a decision was made to hit us with something extra weird just to keep us interested.Performances were not overly impressive, but not really terrible either.  I happen to like many of the actors/actresses and I've enjoyed their other work.  Bottom line, this series as an X-Files meets Lost sort of vibe going.  I'm not sure that this is a good thing."
"First few minutes had a decent feel to it. Then the &#34;thing&#34; starts to be revealed and....eh. The character were so cliche'd and either overacted or played so obvious, almost like directors felt that the audience wouldn't be able to distinguish otherwise. For me, the middle of this genre has played out, and this  brings nothing new to the table. And then the &#34;feel&#34; of the show seems stilted and low budget. Not that low budget has to be bad, but the rest of the writing and characters do nothing to lift the show. I don't see me watching any further."
"Formulaic apocalyptic &#34;thriller&#34; with: scripture quoting prostitute who goes &#34;Full Monty&#34;, lots of gratuitous brutality, standard issue homosexual and racist elements and even a seemingly unkillable tattooed alien who treats us to a few new phrases in his/her dialect,  Oh yeah, they economized on the script by using the &#34;F&#34; word for more than 25% of the dialogue."
"I stuck through the entire episode hoping that it would get better, but this was just awful. it felt like it was done by as a  highschool film class project. The acting was plodding and sometimes painful to watch. The characters were somewhat stereotypical and hard to believe"
"So we have two skyscrapers and this sympathetic woman gets on the elevator in one of them.  We know she isn't going to go very far, especially after the clown gets on with her.Now we have a series of &#34;escapes&#34;.  Out into an apocalyptic world.  But of course the vehicle they get into can get through the snarl.  And they end up in a mansion owned by a diabetic elderly woman.So of course we know the aliens are going to come.  Not the ones who blow up towers, but the ones that land from space.  Or crawl out of the ground.  We have a creature that walks on all fours belly up.  Something we've seen before.We've seen all of this before.  And have little need to see any of it again."
"It was intriguing to start, although a tad slow.  Then it started getting interesting, then odd, then cool, then it became ridiculous.  Another never-ending &#34;Lost&#34; or &#34;Revolution&#34; that suckers you into watching it, but promptly goes to boring filler dialogue-land after a zillion episodes, making you sorry you invested/wasted the time."
It sort of had me in stitches at parts due to the acting and the dialogue. It wasn't for me.
"I'm a fan of a post apocalyptic story if it is done well and I think it is very hard to do them well.  I'm a huge fan of the Walking Dead mostly because it has smart writing, smart characters and was edgy and inventive when I started watching it.  I don't think THE AFTER is going to keep me interested. I'd be willing to re-evaluate after the next show, but given that Amazon's other pilots were ALL so much better than this one I wouldn't want to see this one get made at the expense of one of the other ones.  We have a bunch of stereotypical strangers thrown together by some vague apocalyptic event and for some reason they stick together even though every fiber of my being would tell me that I don't want to be around the stereotypical escaped convict thug (tossing the N word around every other sentence is very offensive to me whether someone is black or white.  We have a female cop, a rich/sick 60 ish whiny woman, a French mom separated from her family, a stereotypically drunken Irish dude, a gay man whom we meet dressed as a clown, a cocky attorney, a religious call girl,  and I'm sure that any other miscellaneous strangers will reveal their stereotypes in the next couple of episodes.  The acting wasn't that great--pretty much overacted by many of them and despite the fact that I LOVED the X-Files this one is going to have to come a long way to come up in my estimation.  I really had hoped to like this but it is what it is....."
"Sorry, I kept watching waiting for it to get better and it just kept getting worse.  I'm not one of the The Walking Dead fans, so I definitely do not need to see something similar."
"Some good acting, here and there...but didn't grab hold, and the alien was pretty lame. Sci-fi needs to be so much more now that the genre is getting saturated!"
"Formulaic!  Poorly written.  Acting is disastrous.  And, what was with the terrible &#34;aging&#34; make-up on &#34;the old lady&#34;?  Two stars for end of the world scenario.  Why the formulaic characters!?!?  Sorry, Amazon, you're no Netflix when it comes to original."
"Not much to grab hold of in the first episode except a creature teaser at the end..This writer should watch an episode of (5 star) Justified. Dialog can be intelligent, entertaining and creative without every other word being &#34;f&#34;. It is distracting at first and becomes disturbing after a while. I am not a prude and I have known some people who talk this way. I found them stupid, lazy and boring.I may watch one more (if it gets off the ground) since I like apocalyptic flicks."
I was looking forward to wathing this pilot becaus it was by Christ Carter but the pilot was awful.  I would not watch another episode.
"I have to agree with the low-rating reviews here, the characters are wooden and stereotyped and the plot is a mishmash. I tried, but I could not make it past minute 43. Biblical overtones... really? Not very original, characters'  gratuitious cursing (I don't mind cursing but this seemed too forced) and nudity was annoyingly trite... and I don't give this pilot the strength to hold up for an entire series. (Hey, Fast Forward had a good premise and did not make the cut, when it came to it, Misfits was entertaining but I didn't follow the entire series...) from other reviews I presume there's a monster responsible for all this (implied, smoke in the sky, broken windows, etc. chaos) ... this is just not IMO series-worthy. Again, too much of a similar concept to Fast Forward, but without the mystery. I was prepared to refute negative reviews but seriously couldn't. On another note, does the commercial from the sponsor at the beginning bode Amazon videos with commercial interruptions? I hope not. Sufficient commercials in the world of ""traditional"" and internet media as it is."
"What happened!  We don't know!  the world has gone mad!  People walking, stagger about and we don't know why.  (Perhaps they watched this pilot.)  Watch out all you March 9th birthday people--apparently the future of the world depends upon you!  This has been done, is being done, so why make another one."
"But I couldn't--it was interminable.  Needs a new script writer. Really really slow. Characters are flat and uninteresting.  What makes a show, no matter what genre, is good character development, and maybe these would perk up.  But the lines they've got to work with!  Come on!  Pretty cop, pretty actress, pretty prostitute--various male character types.  An angry innocent con escapee (black)?  Saying things that are totally inane. Also agree with person who said logic is missing in plot. I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because at least there didn't seem to be gratuitous swearing.  And by the way, I adore post-apocalyptic movies, but only when the character interaction is fresh and deep."
"So, I was really expecting something better than this, being a Chris Carter fan. The acting is great, the story had me on he edge of my seat. The language was a bit rough, the f-bomb bombed after the 20th time it was used (come on, aren't we smarter than that?) But you lost me when the &#34;alien&#34; or &#34;demon&#34; was revealed.  Very bad quality, it turned into a B flick for me. I probably would not continue watching this show, cheeeeezy!"
"Don't producers do story boards any more? And then in the end there they were, &#34;skitters&#34;from another series. Where the hell are the writers when you need them to quit."
disappointing - characters are silly and their reactions are even worse - opening scene of chaos was badly directed. i like this kind of film but it is no Invasion LA
"Despite the high production values and good direction, especially the large set pieces depicting apocalyptic panic, this pilot is more of the usual Fox supernatural/science fiction genre fare.  The usual hot-button topics that screenwriters resort to these days: 9/11 overtones of terror and chaos, crass lip service about racial politics and black men falsely imprisoned.Characters and dialogue are thin, reduced to stereotypes - the yuppy lawyer scumbag, the drunken Irish jerk, poor Sharon Lawrence, a good actress reduced to playing &#34;the old lady&#34;.Too much time is wasted with them running around trying to work out what to do so that the script could tease out its conspiracy mystery as long as possible to end on the usual cliffhanger. And as with previous Chris Carter and shows like LOST, it's clear that the sprinklings of mystery and intrigue are things the writers were making up as they go along and then will try desperately to find explanations for if or when the show is picked up for series."
"This is the same old ""something mysterious and bad happens to a group of strangers"" show.  Most of the action involves people running around confused.  Nothing new in this show to make me want to see more.  Did not find the plot or the characters dynamic enough to give it more than a slight chance.  On to the next new Amazon offering.  The one I want to see is  program where the monkey has a gun.  That would have made the show much better.  Monkeys with guns take over LA and spring primates out of the zoo in a simian rebellion.Plus, what was with the commercial a la Hulu in the beginning.  Hope Amazon is not going to put out videos and then make me watch the same Geico ad one million times in order to get to the story."
"But the concept -- and the situations -- seem forced and/or inherently uninteresting. Also, the characters -- even by the father's own admission -- are selfish and unlovable.  I don't want to spend one more second with anybody in this world.  Good riddance!"
I enjoyed parts of this. I think the actors did a good job. I just don't really see this as going somewhere. It leaves a lot to be desired.
This material might have made for a better movie than a tv series. Can't imagine this sustaining over the long haul.
"Painful to watch. It take &#34;dysfunctional family&#34; to a new level, and not one that makes me look forward to future episodes."
"Annoying, self-important characters except for the father (a very good actor no matter what he is in). A show that panders to Gen-X. Plods along at an equally self-important pace, smug to say the least. Sure to capture a girl on girl demographic as well. Probably the end result of a linear optimization exercise to try and pander to all demographics hoping that something will stick."
Was okay not the worst thing on TV..can see how it could be funny but other wise I was waiting for it to be over.
"I think I read where this was a comedy, but I missed the funny point here and saw a lot of dark drama."
I tried to give this show a shot but none of these characters had any redeemable qualities whatsoever. They were quite pathetic actually.
"Not interesting plot, and lots of shallow self-interested characters going through everyday ordinary life.  More pathetic than funny, not funny at all.  There are lots and lots more sources of interesting entertainment."
"The acting was fine, and it was well shot, but it was very VERY slow and there were no laughs. I didn't care about the characters or what they were doing. If it gets picked up, I am not going to be watching. Not worth free."
Just not that interesting.  Too many depressing story lines.  I usually Jeffery Tambor but this was not his best work.  The is worst of the &#34;pilots&#34; I have seen so far.
"I was irritated from the first moments by the music.  After 10 or 15 minutes of asking ourselves &#34;what the hell?&#34;, we turned it off, never to return I suspect.  Sorry - not our thing."
I liked the Tambor character but didn't like anyone else on the show. This would probably not be a show I would watch on a regular basis because the adult children just didn't interest me. Jeffrey Tambor does his usual good job. As much as I like him I would still have a hard time wanting to see a second episode.
I have never been into this kind of show.  I found myself doing other things about 5 minutes into the show.  It is the only one of the pilots that i would not watch if it is made
"While the actors (especially Tambor) are quite good, the entire premise of the show is shallow and uninteresting.  Yes, the whole family has issues, but guess what, they are all sex!  The daughter likes a little S/M (who cares), the dad is a cross dresser (who cares), the other daughter (wife/mother) is a college lesbian (well, maybe her husband cares... but maybe not).  Maybe these would be show-worthy conflicts in 1970s North Dakota, but in 2014 LA I don't think anyone would notice.  The show just felt flat and predictable, without a true challenge worthy of the actors."
"I'm pretty open minded and I like the road less traveled.  Someone somewhere is very proud of this delusional achievement. Bloated, slow, boring and full of people I could not care less about.  Nothing about this show appealed to me on any level.  I felt like I was trapped in a room with the least talented person ever who was under the impression that they were a genius. I love Jeffrey Tambor but he needs to run from this crap fest ASAP."
"I just could not get get into this show.  Character is my number 1 criterion, but none of these characters held my interest.  Even Jeffrey Tambor, whose work I've liked over the years, left me uninterested.  Even the supposed reveal of his character's secret made me yawnThe pacing of the entire 30 minutes was way too slow.  A half-hour show should move through the story.My second star was for the music, the only element I found enjoyable.  I doubt I'd watch this show if it becomes a series."
"I suppose a broken marriage might turn out three self centered, greedy, destructive adult children even if the parents seem to have found themselves after the break, but this pilot was just overwhelming for me.  For a half hour pilot there was too much bickering, too much nudity, too much sex with totally unlikeable characters - except perhaps for the father who was the only light in the show - and that only in the very last scene.  Doubt that I will be looking at this one again."
"It has an interesting premise, and Tambor is very good, but the adult children are all so self-centered and unlikable that I can't imagine wanting to spend much time with them. Two other observations: This is labeled a &#34;comedy,&#34; but the pilot was 99 percent drama, one percent humor. Also, there's a lot of nudity, but I can't recall the last time I saw so many attractive, naked young actors photographed in such an unflattering manner."
"If I wanted to watch a messed up family work out their issues, I'd go to more extended family gatherings.  This was well acted, with a relatively original storyline, just not my cup of tea.  I hope Amazon takes a pass on this one."
"Couldn't get into it, it's not the kind of humor I like. It's a little depressing too, I think. I'll pass on this series."
"The show was different, and had a unique twist but just isn't for me. Seemed a little over the top and as if the show was reaching for the extreme in too many areas."
"Having scenes of sex or nakedness might draw some people to watch but I need not to feel bore watching actors performing their characters lives, that one of the reasons I don't watch HBO's Girls. It has its moment of having a few laughs but still everything seem sort of dry and didn't make me feel like if Amazon pick it up they''ll get better, I'm pretty much done after this pilot but hey I might change my if future clips of the show peek my interest of giving it another chance."
There are too many taboos being broken in 30 minutes to have time to bond to the people so it's just dirty fluff.
"I don't understand how people find shows like this entertaining. If you enjoy Wes Anderson movies you may like this. It definitely has that vibe, I personally don't care for his films myself. Good cast but I do not relate to any of the characters."
I didn't think the show was funny at all. I couldn't get into the plot of the show either there was nothing captivating or that peaked my interest at all. I like the fact that they were trying to bring transgender into the spotlight a bit more but the show seemed dull at best.
"Sorry but just unable to find real appeal here until the very end, the one factor that cannot be revealed without being a spoiler. And that leaves me willing to watch a second episode. After all, I didn't like Modern Family at first either."
"I'm from L.A. and we got over Jewish humor a long, long time ago. SPOILERS: Dad is a cross dresser? Boring. Daughter is a closet lesbian? Ho, hum. Youngest daughter wants to get spanked by the big black personal trainer? Wow, that took guts to actually put that depth of stereotype on the screen. Too much nudity for no reason. Not a single character portrays anything close to sympathetic. Neurotic Jewishness is a stereotypical theme which has seen its moment and then we all grew up. I also thought the cleverly (not!) tossed in WWII (Krystal Nacht, for example) references in poor taste."
People with problems and not enough charm to keep me interested in how it would all turn out. I'll give it a pass.
"The story of privledged, rich white people with &#34;issues&#34; in California - yuck.  These shows work if there's some element of soulfulness in them and this show had none.  The characters were universally unlikeable, whiny and bizarrely messed up.  Not fun to watch."
I think this is supposed to be a comedy but I didn't find it funny at all. :( :( :(
"I couldn't relate to any of the characters in this comedy.  I just didn't like it.  I watched it all the way through but almost quit watching at one point.  The cast is very good.  The acting was fine.  I just don't relate to a bunch of self centered, neurotic, whiney, characters."
"I live in La and I get tired of seeing shows about characters whose only claim to fame is that they are sexually confused or daring. These characters, including the transvestite father, are becoming cliches. I found myself becoming impatient instead of sympathetic. Also, the show is filmed with what appears to be handheld camera, which I find more appropriate for documentaries. I cannot recommend that this show be picked up. Sorry."
"I recognized the &#34;little sister from now and then instantly&#34; But I found myself watching her gap the entire time, At first I wasn't sure if it was a gap or something stuck in her teeth. It was oddly predictable/ yet very surprising at the same time. It was very real biased on today's times, and very depressing in the same token. It will be a hit or miss, no middle ground. Unless at some point someone gains a bit of witty reprieve I can't see myself sitting down to watch. Ever."
"This show does not take advantage of the potential it has to be great.  Despite all the perverseness, I felt it lacked something to make it more intriguing."
"I guess having a father who's a tranny and older sister who did the 'lesbian thing' or a guy who's into old prostitutes is &#34;interesting&#34; to the bizarity that one finds on the west coast (SoCal specifically) but I found the characters dull in their &#34;thoughtfulness&#34;.  I guess mining the dark comedy of alcoholics, gambling addiction or drug users is blase and too ordinary for the writers of this show, and if I was concerned about being politically correct I'd probably be interested.  But its tedious and 'quirky' for the sake of being 'quirky', and to be honest I'm surprised it has as many 4-5 star ratings as it does."
"I'm a chronological senior citizen and am well aware that my remaining time is limited (even though my brain and interests feel so much younger) so I tend to live by &#34;so many books, so little time&#34; with variations for TV and movies. I loved the premise of an older person finally listening to his inner needs and dealing with them no matter his age and the difficulties, but about 2/3 in he described his kids as selfish and self-centered (just in case we hadn't noticed?). I'm interested in his story, but the kids -- not at all. This is one I won't be watching."
"Blah, blah, blah...junky story the family dynamic and age disparity of the children just makes no sense.  Just didn't like it, couldn't finish it but still didn't hate it as  much as The After."
"As someone who has transgendered friends, I was hoping for something ground breaking, but came away disappointed.  I don't care how good an actor Jeffrey Tambor is, he makes a lousey woman.  There is nothing feminine about him.  I get it, it's supposed to be a comedy, but I find nothing humorous about men who suddenly discover at age 65 they are really a woman.  What have they been doing the last 65 years?  All of this was covered with much greater sensitivity in the movie 'Normal' starring Tom Wilkenson and Jessica Lange.Would love it if television would take a chance and create a show using a real transgendered actor playing a character that we can admire, that will help other trans people gain the respect of our society.  We don't need a show that merely propigates the stereotype about awful looking crossdressers.  Why not depict a young, trans person, that is actually feminine?  They're rare, but they do exist, and that's what makes them special.  It would be interesting if someone would develop a show that educates viewers on all that trans people have to cope with, and show such a character living a positive, successful life."
If this is a comedy it needs a lot of work. Before keeping this I would invest that money into alpha house.
"I tried watching as long as I could, but 20 minutes is all I could take. I don't find &#34;Jewish&#34; humor funny. That is, unless your name is &#34;Seinfeld&#34;. It's not that I'm anti-Semitic, I'm anything but. It's just that smart ass sort of humor does nothing for me. I think a lot of folks will like this show. It's intelligent and I think, with further character development, it might become a hit. I am picky about comedy's and this one doesn't hit my funny bone.  I do think this show will find an audience, though."
"Honestly, just not very good. Way, way too melodramatic and not something I would even consider watching. The whole premise is odd and it did not leave me wanting more."
"It's a bad knockoff of Phineas and Ferb, only without any of the positives.I just don't need that much snark in my *children's* lives. They'll be jaded soon enough.The animation is *great*. The *idea* isn't terrible. But the actual story just hurt to watch."
"This seems to have been set up as some kind of pseudo educational cartoon, but I think it misses the mark in a big way.  I have a 10 year old son that watches cartoons and after watching the pilot this seems to be a poorly put together Johnny Test knock off.  If Johnny Test happened to be about his twin sisters... and they were boys... and there were no humor or entertainment value it would be this cartoon.I was hopeful that this was going to be more in the style of Wild Krats introducing kids to science but no...  The moral of the pilot episode seems to have been &#34;Don't be a bully or you could be turned into a mutant bee and take over your entire school... until the nerds save you&#34;.Come on people, I think our kids deserve better!"
"Nothing original here. The boys do science, the girls do fashion. There's the stuck-up blonde girl character, the teacher with fifties eyeglasses, the rough-voice bully, the intrepid person of color, the evil scientist villain. All of these have been done and overdone. Dexter did it much better years ago. The few clever cultural homages would be missed by the kids and didn't make it more watchable for adults."
"I grew up watching Dexter's Laboratory, and the geniuses on this show are no Dexter and Mandark. The girl on this show is no Dee Dee. When I watched Dexter's Laboratory, there were a lot of funny scenes from episodes. Plus, it was brought back for more entertainment. I would rather watch that show than this which doesn't seem to have any funny moments coming up if it got the green light, or lasting at least two seasons. Plus, we have Phineas and Ferb, and Johnny Test (opposite genders) right now! We don't want something that's going to be a knock-off of either cartoon. Sorry, Jessica!"
"I found this hard to watch, but obviously I'm not the target audience.  Good morals and as the headline says, Congress should be forced to watch the pilot 100x until they understand the meaning of friendship and compromise... Especially those selfish %#*}% in the Tea Party."
It was not the worse of the lot. It was slightly amusing for a short time. It was almost too predictable. The plot needs work and the Kenny G young gun conductor bugged me to no end.  This show did not make me laugh.  I would not foresee myself watching many episodes of this.  The young oboe student seemed to be the most compelling character of the bunch.  I really don't want to see a poor rendition of Sex and the City.
"I agree with the employed classical musician who filed a review here by the name of Seth Goldman.  He found the entire pilot episode preposterous and so did I.  However, unlike me, he knew every little thing that was wrong with it.  However, even I wondered why I didn't see anyone practicing, that playing, playing and playing some more would be the reality of a classical musician's existence. Goldman verified this and that a real classical musician would never find the time to engage in all of these shenanigans. I thought this looked and played like a really bad soap opera from beginning to end.  Amazon, don't make any more episodes of this turkey."
"I did like the Hailey character, but her story reminds me of the Jennifer Beal character in Flashdance.I didn't really care for anything else. It all seems like it has been done before.Highly unlikely that I will be watching anymore of this show."
"Let me guess this one. The girl playing the oboe will get the part after Gael listens to her and will be captivated, she will have a complicated relationship with the guy from the bar while navigating the highly visible and socially demanding landscape of the NY philharmonic scene"
Just a Soap opera set in a Sym Orch. All character are stock and trade types and tell me waws B Peters high or asleep?
I was hoping this show would be somewhat like Nashville only younger and into the classical world.  But again.  Can't watch it with family because there is so much filthy language and stupidity going on.  You want to watch a show that is enjoyable and that the whole family can sit and watch together.  Could you imagine asking grandma to sit and watch this with you?  Come on Amazon...  You can do better.
"I was in orchestra all through school and not once did I think of drilling a hole in the back of my Bass to add a glory hole for personal pleasure while playing. To much degree this show like that thought is why I do not watch MTV anymore. It seems widely agreed that the first 10 minutes offer a show that never materializes and instead falls on its face with Sex drugs and foul mouthed Like like like valley girl slutville yikyak that I could hardly stand as background to a much more intelligent game of candy crush. Please do not lead me to think I am so out of touch with mainstream that this passes as quality entertainment, these actors deserve so much better."
The show was ok at best. The acting was ok and the music was amazing but it just seemed to be missing a decent plot line. I was very disappointed with this series especially after reading other reviews for it.
"Malcolm MacDowell and Bernadette Peters! Unfortunately, they are only guest stars, and the rest of the cast is young, pretty types, and it seems to be a sort of young, improbably pretty classical musicians struggling to find love and success in the Big Apple. Yawn"
"The write up sounded as though it would have potential, with a lot of very talented musicians.  Too bad the rest of it was only so so."
"I simply do not understand all these rave reviews. This was probably the pilot I was most interested in, as I'm a fan of both Coppola and Schwartzman (as well as many of the actors), and love classical music.But this not good. Shades of Smash (in tone) - schmaltzy, not funny, cliched. I don't feel any evidence of the pedigree here. I did enjoy / laugh at the Styx musical, but found the rest dull (endless game of spin the bottle) or groan-worthy (musicians have sex like they play instruments!)"
"I was interested in the concept, and thought the actors/characters were interesting, but then they had to throw in tawdry sex, group sex - yuck!  Why do they have to get into weird stuff to titillate the audience?  Are Americans that jaded?  Just stick with a good plot line and you'll have a winner!"
"A pilot should be hard-charging and compelling, after all its a sales pitch. I am not sure what this show is pitching itself as. Comedy? Really? Comedic Drama? Then again I was not a fan of Sex in the City so maybe I'm just not the target audience."
"I'm in the business, and I'm sorry: there's nothing here. It's a typical pilot nicely wrapped up in classical music (which I dearly love), but offering nothing worth tuning in for on a weekly basis."
"As a classical music lover, one who is well-informed, I found this show to be a tasteless exaggeration of issues in the dying classical world. I was particularly put-off by Bernal's ridiculous appearance (I think a stab at Gustavo Dudamel) and at the misuse of the wonderful Malcolm MacDowell, who is made to over-enunciate, when I've seen him command the English language like a fine musical instrument in the past. I ca';t recommend that this show be picked up."
"While I appreciate that Amazon attempts to showcase the world of classical music in a show, I just found myself bored the entire episode."
I likeed the music but maybe a little Vegas would help to put a little life into it. If it's going to be for adults keep it that way. Step it up a little. Good luck.
This is nothing more than a nighttime sop-opera.  I love classical music and more specifically Mozart so I was hopeful when I started watching the program.  However what I found was just another Smash (NBC TV Series) only instead of Broadway as the setting it was Symphony politics.  Of course it includes the customary injection of liberal social values that entertainment industry loves to promote.
"Okay, let me see if I can guess the inspiration for this show.  Producer finds himself at a classical music concert and starts fantasizing about the orchestra (particularly the hot ones) and thinks ""man, I bet those stiffs are party animals offstage, whoa.... I should totally make a show about snobby, artsy-fartsy musicians acting like out-of-control high-school students"".  Now for the title: if we say ""Shostakovich in the Jungle"" nobody's gonna have a clue what we're talking about and if you go with Handel most peeps only know one of his pieces (which would totally send the wrong message); ""Immortal Beloved"" definitely made Beethoven seem kinda sexy, maybe a little angry but hey.... what about that 80's romantic fantasy ""Amadeus"".... ya, that's the ticket.So what's in a name?  Well, I hate to sound like a wet blanket but just maybe the creators of this show should've tried reading the lyrics to one of the composer's greatest works (Requiem in D Minor) before they associated his name with recreational sex, chemical dependency and towering ego's devoid of any respect for either the music they're playing or the people they're playing it with.  :("
It felt like 30 minutes of porno dialogue with the intercourse removed. Nothing against the mature content. Reminds me of a young adult novel for young women.
I have not found this rocking my world yet. I will give it another try and watch one more episode.
Might be well made but I did not care for the storyline at all. It just didn't seem to go anywhere other than &#34;day in the life&#34; meanderings of artsy New Yorkers.
"As a fan of Major League and sports in general, I thoroughly look forward to any sports tv shows, especially comedies.  However, the execution was lacking in this show."
"In the height of Incognito/Martin fiacso and the emergence of Micheal Sam, this show has horrible timing. Lastly the lead character is downright insulting characterization of cheerleader turned owner. Tasteless humor does not need to come in abundance to be funny."
Stayed through the cringeworthy player cutting scene with Affion Crockett. The cutaways to the FOX analysts was just dumb. Hayes MacArthur was inspired casting but that's about the best I can say for this. I'd rather see Natalie Zea in Californication.
"I blame comedies like this for the &#34;dumbing down&#34; of America.  Maybe I'm just not in the mainstream audience category.  I thought the premise might be good - about a pro-football team - like the show Necessary Roughness.  But, here the humor wasn't funny.  My responses to many scenes were &#34;what a stupid stereotype&#34; and &#34;how can anyone be so dumb&#34;.  I don't think we need another tv series like this.  Either that, or get new writers and producers."
"Natalie Zea is charming enough, but this show is definitely not. The writing is poor and forced, every single joke fell flat (well, at least during that 10-minute stretch that I actually watched it), and this whole idea was done much, much better with the old HBO series 1st & Ten (and one season's story line on the recently-canceled Necessary Roughness).Doesn't deserve a series, and for those who are reading this and wondering if they should even watch the pilot itself, it doesn't deserve that, either."
"I admit, I'm not much on comedies, but I liked that it was a football comedy. But there isn't much football happening in their football show. And I thought the comedy was forced and immature. Sure, the lead lady is extremely beautiful. But that's not enough to keep me watching. PLEASE make &#34;The After&#34;!"
"It reminds me too much of HBO's First and Ten with Delta Burke.I like Natalie Zea, but that was about it.The story isn't new or fresh.If more episodes of this show are made, it it highly unlikely that I will watch them."
Another sports-centric show--yawn.  This didnt grab me and when it was over I had no interest in seeing more.  Natalie Zea won me over but the rest of the cast got lost in unfamiliar-faceville.
"Natalie Zea is much better than the rest of the show. Watching this afterTRANSPARENT: The Pilot [HD] I realized how well she would have fit in with that ensemble. It's not too late.This series can be saved, but it will take some serious work on episode 2 in rooting out the slapstick and inanity for me to want to watch one more time."
"If you've seen Wildcats or Major League or any other sitcom/movie where the owner or coach is female, then you've already seen this. Lots of male chauvinists and dumb jocks and &#34;you go girl!&#34; attitude. Not terrible, but not the least bit original, either."
"I guess it just isn't my thing. I like football and thought it would be fun, but just didn't make me laugh or care or whatever it should make me want to do. It felt a little bit hack to me, but I see it is getting good reviews so maybe I just don't get it."
"I didn't find the story very interesting, and I didn't laugh a lot. A lot of it seemed too contrived to me.I mean if people like it, then sure move it forward, but if its between this and the others, I say this is the worst of the bunch. I couldn't even push myself to finish watching it."
"This was okay but not great, especially not in comparison with the other 2 comedies Amazon premiered. Natalie Zea is good, though."
"As football fans, my husband and I were excited at the promise of a football comedy.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  I gave it two stars, my husband said he would have given it three.  The jokes are way too forced, 3/4 of the acting is bad, and I just don't see how they will pull off this premise for an entire season, let alone multiple seasons.  Let me guess; they'll have a difficult start to the season, lots of interpersonal relationship issues between the teammates and administrative staff as they struggle to find common ground with a female owner and a soft-spoken boy next door GM who eventually win them over, so eventually they'll bond and somehow fight their way to the top.  And then what?  I could see it as a cheesy sports movie, but not a television show.  They're just trying too hard.  If they do decide to continue it, play down the whole woman as a football owner premise (I mean come on, it's 2014, a woman in power isn't a shocker anymore - and acting like it is insulting) and for the love of god, cut the puffy hair off the lead male character."
"Although the premise is intriguing, I found the writing to be really sub-par.  I couldn't get pulled into the storylines and found all of the characters to be quite forgettable."
"said, &#34;Being the team GM is a privilege, not a right... You've got to earn their respect&#34;More stereotypical behavior. Stereotypical blacks, blonde women and mysongistic men. Come on writers."
"When Amazon announced it's line up for the new pilot season, I had high hopes for this show. I was very wrong.A woman owner that knows nothing about football, a GM with no experience, players that are walking, breathing stereotypes, and a monkey that sniffed coke and fired a gun. That's what this show is.The comedy in this show was crude and predictable. Most of the main characters weren't even likeable. If this was to get picked up, if they continue with the same tone as the pilot, I'd expect more of the same.The only reason that this series even gets 2 stars is because of the Fox Sports Sunday crew and Billy Dee Williams being on the pilot episode."
This is OK but it is so tough to believe the story line that it becomes more stupid than entertaining.  It could have potential if you made it more believable.
Do we really have to have another show where people behave like juvenile idiots? I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
"I love Natalie Zea in everything she does, but this show has no chemistry, isn't funny, and has over dressed football players."
"I had hopes that this would veer toward a romantic comedy/drama reminiscent of Moonlighting. It didn't.  While the promise of future romantic drama is there, the dialogue and plot were tired. I don't want to tune in weekly to follow the angst of yet another parent trying to do the right thing in their oh-so-complicated life. This one was a miss with me."
There is far better writing and comedy in the Amazon Pilot program.The same ol'formula will get the same ol'laughs...Not impressed at all.There is an instant lack of credibility when the PFL gets thrown into the mix..
"Not a fan. A storyline line this needs comedy off the charts, and unfortunately The Rebels couldn't keep my interest."
I prefer by far the dark humor in Amazon's other proposed series -- Transparent -- to the frat-boy humor found here. The cast is appealing and I think this would be a crowd-pleaser for folks who like sitcoms.
"When you are watching the show, it feels like someone went through a list of items to include in a drama/comedy and checked them off one at a time.And how about a little less stereo typical dumb blond inherits from husband and more empowered woman please.It would have been much better if she'd been a successful woman in some totally alien field, and then had the team dumped on her by dead husband.Capable woman coping with new world of challenges, smart.  The cheerleader trophy wife that rises to challenge has been done and dumb.It's the 21st century, enough with the women who can't make it on their own without a man/husband handing it to them."
"The worst show of the pilots, not funny, poor writing and actors trying to hard.  Amazon should invest in shows that have something new to say or provide plot and strong character development--The Rebels has none of this."
"As someone not interested in football, I thought maybe I'd get a kick out of a woman who has inherited a football team.  Unfortunately, this show was not funny and the acting was not very good.  It's odd, because Zea was pretty good in Justified."
"The bar for shows based around professional football hasn't been set very high. There really aren't many shows that made any lasting impression, let alone that were any good. Sadly, &#34;The Rebels&#34; doesn't even clear the low expectations. The first issue is that, once again, we have a football show that seems to be written by people who know nothing about football. Or who, at least, don't care to make the show seem remotely realistic. Now, I know that I shouldn't be expecting realism from a show with a coked out monkey with a gun but the football stuff wasn't funny either. In fact, not much in the show was funny at all.I love Natalie Zea but that just makes me hope even more that this show doesn't get picked up because this would be a waste of her talents."
"I like Titus Welliver.  But, this show seems like a bad adaptation from a mediocre crime novel.  It does not adequately transform whatever the original material was into an interesting television show.  It seems like an ABC show that would be cancelled mid-season.It's a throwback to 80's noir TV dramas, but lacking in depth or interest, with cliched, hackey dialogue, and some incredibly lackluster supporting actors.I was utterly uninterested after several plot developments and didn't care at all about any of the characters."
Didn't find the storyline engaging.  Characters seemed to do the best they could.  Script is needs more effort to engage the viewer
I thought this was slow. I have read the books and was very excited to watch it. I didn't finish this first episode. It just felt really slow.
"I'm surprised so many people enjoyed this show. I found the main character to be unpleasant and unlikable. The case was very dark, and there was so much smoking it was making me nauseous!"
Just wasn't that good. The dialog was very predictable and the actor who played Bosch just doesn't work as a star. I doubt that I would make this part of my regular viewing.
"Police shows are best when episodic. You get to do character development while telling different stories each week. I don't want to watch 10 episode about chasing one case or following one trial. It just means that the facts, reveals and details will be drawn out and that at the end of the season they will give you one little nugget to make sure you come back next year. Not interested.I'd give it one star but Two guys from the Wire and one guy from Walking Dead is always worth an extra star."
"I feel like I've watched this story line in other shows umpteen times before--the male main character who's rough around the edges, but also kind of a hero.  Except this show doesn't hold my attention nearly as well as some of the others have. I'm quite surprised by the other high reviews on here & I much preferred Mozart in the Jungle and especially Transparent--I'm hoping that's the one that gets picked up--it's unique and interesting and left me wanting more!"
I really am stunned that this show seems to be getting the highest rating of all the new original pilots. It's like all the other crime/cop dramas on TV already
"Like this pilot think it is great but a little slow, more like a law n order. I can't say I would watch it if they made it a series as there are sooooo many cop/court/detective dramas already. too original I like Bosch the character just want more gritty, dirty and grime. and maybe more action than just a fall down a hill. but for those who love and I mean love :) cop shows that are more about the investigation, this is for you-enjoy."
The episode barely kept my attention and I was not left with a feeling of wanting to see more.  It won't be my first choice if I'm looking for something to watch.
"I read the books, so can ""identify"" but I don't care for the actor chose for this part not ""scruffy"" enough for Bosch, at least the one I have an image of........."
"What a waste of talent. There's lots of acting skill in the cast but they haven't been given a script worthy of their abilities. Drawn out underlit scenes of Bosch smoking obviously fill in for the times when the writers had nothing else to say. Just another police show about a cop with a questionable past. Yawn. Internal Affairs hates him? Wow, never saw that before. Tough as nails lieutenant? Central casting. Two stars for the actors but please find an original script and concept."
"This was boring. I like Titus Welliver, but I'm so bored with cop dramas. The production looked good. Spend your dollars on something else."
"BOSCH is a great series of book which huge TV potential, but this pilot does the character no justice.BOSCH is set in Los Angeles with wonderful and picturesque settings but in this pilot the actor's overall demeanor and lack of personality quickly diminishes the entire show into a flashback detective caught in today's world.The cliffhanger was actually the best part of the entire show but it was definitely too late.I was so excited to hear this pilot was being done but the result was less than apealing. overall great books poor pilot attempt."
"I am really confused as to why this show was rated so highly. I found it extremely BORING! It was your cookie cutter crime drama, but with a lot more cigarette smoking. If you want to watch a good crime drama with Titus Welliver, you should watch The Good Wife on CBS instead."
"Felt like a fairly standard police procedural. I don't think the concept was that revelatory or exciting. The execution was adequate.  If they had an exciting new concept with an adequate execution I probably would have been more impressed (alternately, their current concept with an amazing execution).  It wasn't...bad.  Just not that great. My response while watching it was one long, drawn-out meeehhh.I am not a big fan of this genre, so I may not be the most reliable reviewer."
"I'm sure the series is counting on reeling in the viewer and hoping that the viewers read the book(s), but the series wasn't compelling. The actors did a decent job with what they were given, but the dialogue wasn't believable, the plot was thin and predictable, and it was easy to look away. In fact, I found it hard to pay attention to something so monotonous. It's &#34;bad cop character hunts monstrous killer&#34; for the umpteenth time and wasn't done in a way that sets it apart from all the other series that follows that same format.I wanted to like this one. I truly did. It just doesn't work thus far."
"If this show makes it out of all the other ones then there's no hope for humanity, cop shows thrive on dragging on and being boring as always."
"He is not a good actor the show is ok but a bit boring to me, I am not crazy about this show."
I turned this off after the opening scenes...it didn't engage me. It might so well on network broadcasting...maybe even cable but not up to Amazon standards.
I found Bosch to be a slow paced show.  I had to fight to get through the entire episode.  This is a show that I could live without.
"I really wanted this to be good, Titus Welliver is a very fine actor who deserves a good show.  However it was very unsatisfying.  The mystery introduced is apparently one that would play out over several episodes, but at the end of this one, you would expect one major clue to be opened or resolved and that doesn't really happen.  I think the creators of the show decided they didn't want &#34;done in one&#34; mystery episodes but if you are going to string along the audience then each episode needs to be packed with interesting characters and sub plots.  Not the case here."
"This show could use some better editing and less crime drama dialogue. You've got a great cast that can pull it along, but the pace was incredibly slow and the dialogue was &#34;cop show&#34; predictable. The best thing about it was the amount shown in the court scenes. It seemed like the creators had a legal consultant, but forgot to do their ride-along. With the redundant flashbacks of the shooting, the unbelievable allowances that his supervisor was giving him after he was suspended and the fact that he did at least 3 things in the show that would have resulted in disciplinary action and demotion makes this show try too hard to have the stereotypical rebel cop. Can someone PLEASE tell crime shows that the audience doesn't flashbacks? You can say someone got shot -- we don't need to see a replay of it."
"I am repeating another review I read here:  a bad table read.  Really.  Except they aren't sitting at a table, they are walking and sitting and smoking --- all  with crappy production values and bad dialogue.  Watch one episode of The Closer or the Amazon Pilot Mozart in the Jungle and then watch this and you will know what I mean.  Where the heck are all the 5 star reviews coming from?  Professional reviewers?  I say thumbs down!!!"
"I REALLY wanted to like this movie.  I like Elijah Wood and John Cusack, both,...so for me, this was a pretty easy choice.  Unfortunately, the story just doesn't have the same quality as the actors that starred.The movie follows famed pianist, Tom Selznick (Wood), in his attempt to make a come back following a 5 year hiatus.  He had apparently attempted to play ""The Impossible Piece"" during his last live performance and hit the wrong notes causing him a breakdown and a newly acquired bout of stage fright.  His wife, Emma (Kerry Bish&eacute;), is a world famous actress that has set her sights on fixing his problem.  She sets up a symphony in honor of his recently deceased mentor, Patrick Godureaux (Jack Taylor) with Reisinger (Don McManus) acting as Conductor for the performance.  As Tom begins to play he sees strange markings in his sheet music.  After he begins reading, he is instructed to rush to his dressing room during a ""down moment"" in the piece, where he finds an ear piece which he then uses to communicate with Clem (Cusack), the man behind the strange writing.  Clem informs him that he MUST play ""The Impossible Piece"" at the end of the show to perfection or both he and his wife will die.Sounds interesting, right?  I sort of thought so too.  Of course, I also took into consideration the level of acting that was involved in the picture.  Unfortunately, they must have seen more than I did in the final product.  The movie, while interesting at times, is just too ridiculous to be believable.*******SPOILERS*******Apparently, Clem is a locksmith.  And having done work for the late Patrick Godureaux, he installed a lock inside his famous Grand Piano that only someone able to actually play, The Impossible Piece, could open.  Apparently, there are only 2 people that have this ability:  Godureaux and Tom Selznick.  Since Godureaux is dead, that only leaves Tom.  If this were the case, Clem (as an apparent MASTER locksmith(?)) could either break into the late Godureaux's estate and dismantle the piano for the key hidden within, or simple pick the lock that the key opens?  At the very least, couldn't he just have gotten Selznick alone and had him play it that way?  Either way, the whole plot seemed WAY to far fetched for my taste.  Besides, the contents of the safe are never revealed.******* END SPOILERS*******Final Verdict:  PASS!  You WILL be disappointed.If this review has helped you, please click the ""yes"" button below to let me know.  Thanks."
"Elijah Wood plays a brilliant concert pianist with terrible stage-fright who is performing a comeback concert in memory of a dead mentor.  Once he starts playing he is given something to really worry about--a message from a sniper saying if he plays one wrong note he will be shot and if he stops the concert or signals for help his wife will be shot.It's a neat set-up even if it's basically Phone Booth in a concert hall and the movie is directed with so much energy and flair, and Elijah Wood is so persuasive as the twitchy pianist--it's possible you might not even notice how terrible the script is.In the film's one clever bit Wood manages to text for help to his brother-in-law in the audience while playing a difficult piano piece without the sniper seeing what he's doing.  Unfortunately, it's never set up that texting the brother-in-law might be helpful--it would have been nice if he were an off duty cop or something like that--and 5 minutes later the movie is back in exactly the same place it was before Wood sent the text.In fact that's pretty much where the movie stays until late in the film when the only other twist comes and you find out what exactly is going on.  Unfortunately, the minute the movie reveals villain John Cusack's motives it becomes very clear that his carefully orchestrated plot is, in fact, ridiculously stupid, and that there must be at least a half dozen better ways to achieve what Cusack's character wants that would be easier, safer, and much more likely to succeed.Still Grand Piano looks great and it's directed with the bravado of 1970's era Brian De Palma (when his movies didn't suck).  Elijah Wood does nicely with a change of pace non-psycho role.  John Cusack, on the other hand, is stuck playing the man with the idiotic plan and doesn't manage to do much with his poorly written character or terrible dialogue.Fans of stylish thrillers who don't care about storytelling will likely eat this up.  Everyone else should keep their expectations low."
"I like the show, but it moves too slowly.  There are like 3 episodes and they call it a season. Then I have to wait a year to find out what's next. Pretty frustrating. I will wait until the entire series is over and then watch them all in the same day. Not sure what the trouble is, but there should 8 - 9 episodes a year.  Also the plot is drifting. Fighting and acting scenes very good."
"I was hopeful this would be ""a little gem"" like one review stated.....even a gem of a B horror movie.Well in my opinion, this ""little gem"" stunk! Very poor story development.....lack luster acting all around...anda few scattered scares....but by that time who cares?  Very poorly done all around.....not even one of thosereally bad horror movies....that are SO bad they are kinda fun. Nope....this one has no redeeming qualities.I love a good haunted house movie.....this one fell super short in my opinion."
This is a feable attempt at a play on words with the title.  It says that it is a sneak peak before it goes to the movies but it is never going to make it to the movies.  I do not recommend this movie unless you are a cheese ball.
"In my review of season one I had written that I felt this was an odd interpretation of the Thomas Harris characters. Season two though has taken it to an all new level. This supposedly was a prequel to events in the book and movie Red Dragon. Yet in this season they are killing off characters that play pivotal roles in both RD and SOTL. So how exactly does that work ?What the writers have done to the Will Graham character here makes the events that occur in Red Dragon impossible. A case of ""you cannot get there from here"". As a stand alone series this can be interesting. Any link to the stories of the author Thomas Harris have been tossed to the wayside."
"This review is for the Season 6 Episode 5 of the show for Amazon Instant Video, not just for the show.  I enjoy the show very much; however, the service from Amazon Instant Video is very slow.  The episode is already out on iTunes....I am thinking of canceling the TV pass and signing up for it on iTunes since they have the same thing.  It is sort of odd that Amazon isn't more competitive with their service considering their competition.  I know you can also watch it for free on the Logo site but for some I cannot get it to pay on my puter right now."
"This just is not my cup of tea. It's easy to see what will be coming down the road. The actors are good, (I love Jason Momomia ) but they just can't lift the script out of the mundane."
"I like the main actor. After watching Stargate: Atlantis, I went looking for something else he was in. There is not a single likable character. I was very disappointed."
Red Road is confusing to watch from the start. The actors just seem uncomfortable in their parts which makes you want to watch something else.
"The opening to &#34;Adult World&#34; is enough to let you know what you're in for as you witness Amy attempt to commit suicide by sticking her head in the oven and putting a plastic bag over her head. After getting a job at Adult World, Amy's boss is a very down to earth guy named Alex (Evan Peters) who may work at an adult video store, but has no issue with that whatsoever and he doesn't let that affect his other interests. It's through Alex and Adult World that Amy meets a drag queen named Rubia (Armando Riesco) and even though they get off on the wrong foot they eventually become really good friends.Unfortunately Amy is blinded by selfishness and obsessed with a pessimistic hack. Amy makes a series of poor decisions to try and follow her dream of becoming a poet. She makes childish mistakes, but then becomes upset when someone calls her a child. She's irritating, has a nerve-grating voice, is naive, and extremely pompous as she seems to look down on everyone around her. Alex at least seems normal even though he works in what some would consider an uncomfortable environment, but the most interesting character is Rubia. The character really doesn't do much other than smoke pot, ride a stolen bicycle, and give other women makeovers, but Rubia never pretends to be anything that she isn't. Amy asks Rubia in one scene if she has ever felt invisible. Rubia's face distorts as she says, &#34;Not really.&#34; It's as if Rubia has all the attention she's ever wanted while Amy continues to search for the big break she's always craved.If you can persevere through Amy's temper tantrums and John Cusack acting like he has no interest in being in &#34;Adult World,&#34; then there actually is something really positive and inspirational lying under layers within the film. Like &#34;Inside Llewyn Davis,&#34; &#34;Adult World&#34; seems to speak to you if you've ever felt like a struggling artist. Along the way, Amy learns that it's not just about making a name for yourself, getting rich, or becoming famous. You can't make a carbon copy of the path your idol took or follow in anyone else's footsteps. Sometimes you have to take your own path and create your art just for you.&#34;Adult World&#34; has this really exceptional message wrapped up in this unbelievably obnoxious package that almost makes the entire experience unbearable. It's like a really disgusting bag of garbage filled with rotting produce and decomposing meats; the type of garbage that creates that dirty, brown trash juice you always find bleeding out of dumpsters. Yet in the middle of that bag is something worthwhile like a forgotten treasure map or one of your favorite comic books magically still in mint condition. &#34;Adult World&#34; may have meaning, but you have to trudge through waist deep piles of unfiltered, prepubescent, overdramatic whimpering just to get to it."
"Sadly, this movie disappointed. I was looking forward to the quirky girl who finds herself or love or something else interesting. Instead, we're treated to a histrionic college-age diva who lacks almost any redeeming qualities. Ostensibly, she wants to be a poet, and haunts the guy (John Cusack) who she idolizes. He lets her into his world, only to try to teach her a few lessons. However, our oblivious heroine fails to catch on until the very end, and even then, she remains barely likable. Of course there are the supporting cast of the usual suspects: the boy who paints only her, the loving couple that owns the adult book store, as well as the usual stereotypes. The premise had a long way to go, but it stayed too shallow, never delving into the young lady's lack of worldly experience, how that could have been remedied, and how she could have found meaning in her life that might have translated into worthy writing of poetry or another form. John Cusack played his character perfectly, and that was what keep me watching. Otherwise, it was simply the movie that couldn't end soon enough. Oh, well."
"Giving this movie three stars  would be to generous ,ugh! This movie reminded me of ""Booty Call"" back in the day a up grade from that movie. Kevin Hart ,you could have done better the movie with Ice cube ""Ride alone"" was a pretty good movie . This movie was garbage it should go straight to netflix."
"**1/2So what do we have here? Nothing but another unnecessary remake of an &#8216;80s film. This time it&#8217;s &#8220;About Last Night,&#8221; the romantic drama starring Demi Moore and Rob Lowe, which was itself based on the highly acclaimed play by David Mamet, provocatively entitled &#8220;Sexual Perversity in Chicago.&#8221; In this version, it&#8217;s Joy Brand and Michael Ealy who play the young urban couple who meet, fall in love, move in together, then begin to have doubts about the efficacy and durability of their relationship.Brand and Ealy are appealing and attractive performers, and both have done fine work on TV, Brand in &#8220;Parenthood&#8221; and Ealy in &#8220;Almost Human.&#8221; But here they have been let down by screenwriter Leslye Headland, who proves herself incapable of getting past all the timeworn tropes and cliches that have become so much a part of the romantic comedy genre. The movie becomes just another men-are-from-Mars/women-are-from-Venus-type scenario, filled with girl-talk and guy-talk and all the predictable sturm und drang soul-baring and commitment issues (mainly on the part of the man, of course) that such narratives are prone to. Too often the things pulling the couple apart feel scripted and manufactured rather than organic and real. Under the slick but lackluster direction of Steve Pink, everyone just seems to be going through the motions, without any real passion or conviction.The movie also comes replete with the requisite smart-aleck, comic-relief couple (well-played by Kevin Hart and Regina Hall) to serve as a foil for the one on center-stage. Yet, even the humor tends to aim low when it should be aiming high.I like the way the story hits the re-set button in the final scene, but by then it&#8217;s a case of too little too late and we&#8217;ve already moved onto the next movie."
"In That awkward moment, three best friends find themselves at that confusing moment in every dating relationship when you have to decide ""So...where is this going?""First I must say that this is definitely a chick flick and not that I am against that but this is definitely orientated towards a female audience more than a male audience. There are some funny moments that did make me laugh but unfortunately there was not enough of those.  Secondly, the three male leads acted like a bunch of women at times and more in a way that catered to that female audience that I am talking about.There were some moments of cuteness but the movie was very predictable in its ending as it seems a lot of movies in the genre seem to be these days.  Whatever happened to the ""Chasing Amy"" type movies that don't always have that clich&eacute; ending.  Unfortunately not here.My wife definitely liked better than me but even still she says it is a 3 star movie at best.  I personally give this some thing in between at 2.5 stars."
"Three guys vow to stay single. Jason (Zac Efron) is a NYC book cover designer who plays the field. He doesn't realize he is dating a woman until after they break up with him. Daniel (Miles Teller) works with Jason and has a friends with benefits relationship with Chelsea (Mackenzie Davis). Guess how that works out...hint it's a chick flick. Mike (Michael B. Jordan) is a doctor whose wife (Jessica Lucas) wants a divorce and is cheating on him with a lawyer. Jason meets Ellie (Imogen Poots) who is everything he wants in a woman as this throws a wrench into the &#34;everybody stay single and play the field like we're in college&#34; vow.This is a chick flick poorly disguised as a guy's film. We know it is a chick flick because it is overrated due to Zac Efron being in it. It tosses some crude humor at us and some better barbs about relationships, but frankly it is the same old Hollywood schtick that brings nothing new to the table. Having said that, the actors did a fine job in their roles made unconvincing by a trite script.Will do as a chick flick rental, although I thought &#34;The Other Woman&#34; was a funnier chick flick.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex. No nudity. Efron nearly nude."
"This is a story done semi-documentary style about a group of amateur authors who read their writings to the group and bounce off ideas. Their writings overtly and boringly reflect their own personal life.  The bulk of the movie being consumed by interviews.Hannah Rinaldi (Kaley Cuoco aka Penny) the stereotyped dumb blond sends ripples through the group when she secures a book deal.The film attempts to be a clever quirky indie, but falls short of being either. I found the interview scenes boring and pretentious. It was like a constant narration. Perhaps the funniest part was the writing of Colette Mooney (Teri Polo) who was terribly attempting to write a Russian novel, yet everyone gave her encouragement. And BTW the heroine of her tale was suddenly having an affair with a young peasant man.For hard core indie fans. A subtle comedy, but not a great one.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."
"During the first zombie outbreak that we don't get to see, over 100 million people died. A drug was found to control the disease. There is a catch. The drug must be injected every 36 hours or the person reverts. There is a short supply of the drug as it is derived from the spinal column of dead zombies. Kate (Emily Hampshire) is a doctor who treats &#34;the Returned&#34; and has a boyfriend Alex ( Kris Holden-Ried) who is a music teacher and one of them.Kate buys treatments under the table. She has to battle against the societal prejudice against &#34;zombies&#34; which has become a politically incorrect word. It takes about 40 minutes to develop the plot and character.The film has parallels to homophobia and various prejudices, after all who wants their sister to marry a zombie? There are anti-return groups and killings.The main problem is when the movie picks up it still moves slow. I kept waiting for something to catch and hold my interest. The ending was a yawn in spite of the attempt at being a dramatic twist. Not exactly a zombie film.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity"
It was a bit too slow and dull-witted for me.  I actually fell asleep while watching..... not usual for me.
"life already has this pace this feeling of ennui and helplessness. if you would like to increase your sense of ineptitude and undesirability, watch this film."
"Okay...some nice pictures, some nice information, but for the most part this is really a series for children or the cosmically deficient.  Totally not impressed."
"I'll try to be succinct:  1.  This isn't as good as the original, regardless of the cgi or special effects, which, btw, are cheesy and not so good - especially the graphic of Saturn (with a missing lower half of the orb) and especially the godawful spaceship.  As bad as the original spaceship was, it is better than this one.2.  Do we need 7 minutes of credits from the 'producer', 'executive producer', 'co-executive producer', 'executive co-executive associate producer', etc. etc.? I'm surprised the FOX logo isn't placed in the lower right of the screen for the entire episode - thank god it isn't. 3.  I'll wait for the complete series to come on DVD and then borrow it from the library, for free."
"Please note, I have now watched all the new episodes by now and every time I have flat out fallen asleep or just turn the TVS off. The original COSMOS literally changed my life forever. This new version makes me literally snore on the couch in about 9 minutes. How could they of botched this entire series so badly? There is a great responsibility to produce this program to be amazing and its just lame. Dr. Tyson is a fun scientist but he doesn't really work in this program.  He seems nervous and speaks with a tone that makes you feel like your at a kindergarten story time reading. At times he looks like he is thinking to himself, ""... I know this is going to suck"" or ""... I don't get why we are doing this?""... He seems uncomfortable on camera and I don't think that is because he is uncomfortable in front of a camera. I think its because he is realizing that the production and direction Fox is taking creating with him as the host... is seemingly... sucking?!  Its lacking that ""pocket"" and synergy that Sagan and his production created. With 20 years advancement in special effects and scientific knowledge... FOX can't make a space documentary that is mind blowing?  Why?.... This is COSMOS!?  How could that be allowed to happen?Why are there so many boring, cheap cartoons!  They suck! Is this because they wanted to save money on actors and effects so they went to cheap cartoon technology to get the required content for a show?  The cartoons are clearly a hint that something went wrong at the production of this show.The content also lacks cohesion. It bounces around and makes really obvious and sophomoric points, or completely fails to make a point altogether. The actual science and sense of awe we should be getting from this show is lighter then any other similar cosmology documentary. It left me saying over and over again, ""... I already knew that. Ive known that since I was 12 years old"".  The point that the milky way galaxy is really, really big and that stars are far, far away... is a point I don't need to be patronized with for an hour and $2. Tell me something that is awe inspiring?  Who wrote this script?  The script and topics they choose are just completely uninspired, back room napkin, after thoughts.One episode which was the worst, was almost entirely in the lame cartoon format and it went on and on about the guy that discovered that Lead in regular gasoline was polluting our environment. This story was told through a cheap ""Johnny Quest"" style cartoon for an hour and at the end of all this, there was no connection or point to cosmology that I could readily see.  The only episode that was inspiring and echoed the original series in beauty and script was ""Sisters of the Sun"" where they talked about stars. But here again, compared to other similar programs discussing similar topics, this was like watching the opening premise that stars are really, really hot and really, really big and really , really, far, far away over and over again.  The science has ZERO depth. The script is either written for morons or was written by morons? Why would Tyson sign off on this?Its a HUGE disappointment for COSMOS fans. Tyson is impedent as the host, the script has no cohesion, the episodes are childish, they rip you off with boring cartoon story telling to save a buck on production costs, it ends and you feel like you just ate a rice cake. It is a completely dry, uninspiring waste of time, with no flavor... its lame and a shame, Carl Sagan deserves better."
"Boring, poor editing, not very good investigative techniques.I can see why I never heard of the show, not worth the time."
"I really tried hard to watch this show, but got bored with it really quickly. I like to be on the edge of my seat when watching ghost stories or shows, but this one put me to sleep and no excitement."
"Although showing excellent production values and acting, I found this series disappointing. It seems to be edging away from the detective thriller mode into the horror-macabre mode, with scenes added for the benefit of masochistic viewers who want to experience fear and revulsion."
"I was half hoping for something substantial to develop , but sadly thirty minutes in i almost could predict what the actors were going to do and say.I just found myself yawning and getting up to do other things at home wash dishes laundry etc.I was also hoping for less than obvious dialog and acting but sadly i was left wondering why the heck did i waste my money on this film.Put aside the special effects and you have pretty much nothing .. i tried to sit through the entire film and felt what's the point."
"The disaster of the city of Pompeii took place in the year 79 AD and has really become more of a tragic legend than fact.  Although historians are aware of the time frame in which the volcano, Mount Vesuvius, erupted &#8211; along with having some names of people that died in the catastrophe &#8211; that&#8217;s really all they know.  With that in mind, the imagination and fictitious accounts make up the storyline for the period adventure flick, Pompeii.Paul W. S. Anderson (Resident Evil, Mortal Kombat) directs the epic, Pompeii &#8211; starring Kit Harington as Milo.  As a young boy, Milo watched as the Romans slaughtered his people (and parents), led by a dastardly soldier, Corvus (Kiefter Sutherland).  Although Milo survived the attack, he was captured and thrown into slavery, eventually becoming a lethal gladiator.  In fact, he&#8217;s so lethal that his master, Graecus (Joe Pingue), decides to move him to a grander stage in the city of Pompeii.On the way to Pompeii, the lives of Milo and a wealthy merchant&#8217;s daughter, Cassia (Emily Browning), become intertwined.  Shortly thereafter, Milo learns he must fight Pompeii&#8217;s gladiator champion, Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) &#8211; but prior to their showdown, the two men form a surprising and unsuspecting friendship.  At the same time, the man that killed Milo&#8217;s family, Corvus, comes to town and is now a well-respected (and feared) Roman senator.Corvus has been looking for Cassia (whom he desperately wants to marry) and quickly notices the growing bond that has formed between Cassia and Milo.  In an effort to dispose of Milo, Corvus puts both Atticus and Milo in the Pompeii coliseum for the fight of their lives &#8211; a fight in which they are sure to lose their lives.  However, without any warning, a volcano outside the city erupts thrusting everyone into a panic as the sky rains with fire and ash.For the fans of the popular film, Gladiator, the plot of Pompeii will appear to be extremely familiar.  Both feature a storyline that is driven by revenge after the death of the main character&#8217;s family.  But, Pompeii is certainly no Gladiator and the fact that both films are being used in the same sentence is borderline outrageous.  Still, it&#8217;s hard to ignore the similarities between the two movies &#8211; prompting Pompeii to easily be labeled as a dreaded Gladiator &#8220;knockoff.&#8221;Kit Harington, who is most recognizable from his starring role in the popular HBO drama, Game of Thrones, plays a character that we&#8217;ve seen countless times in the past &#8211; and again is much like the lead character in Gladiator (although Harington is a far cry from the masterful Russell Crowe).  Milo is cold as ice on the outside, but clearly filled with righteous emotions on the inside.  He&#8217;s been driven by revenge his whole life, but once he lays his eyes on the beautiful &#8220;princess,&#8221; suddenly his heart melts and he has new meaning to live.If you happen to be a fan of Jon Snow (Harington&#8217;s Game of Thrones character), then you should find just as much enjoyment in the Milo character.  Harington literally looks like he walked of the set of Game of Thrones and jumped right into Pompeii.  In fact, the two characters are so similar that it will be almost impossible to tell them apart.  Unfortunately, it&#8217;s difficult to determine whether or not that&#8217;s a good thing or a bad thing.  Really, the only bothersome part of Harington&#8217;s character in Pompeii is that it&#8217;s filled with far too many holes since viewers will have no idea what happened to the character from childhood to adulthood &#8211; although one could assume he was constantly in chains.The main character depth issue, which plagues many films that have previously attempted to do too much in too little time &#8211; evident in films like John Carter and Prince of Persia, also hampers Pompeii.  Several lead characters, like Emily Browning&#8217;s Cassia or Kiefer Sutherland&#8217;s Corvus, are nothing more than randomly in the wrong place at the wrong time &#8211; sort of like anyone that was aboard the Titanic.  Sadly, the ambitions of these two vague, aloof characters are never fully realized, and are poorly reduced to taking part in an under whelming love triangle.Storyline aside, the CGI is also an issue that takes away from the film.  For roughly the first half of the film, the actors are mostly able to avoid the dreaded green screen.  However, as the volcano begins to erupt and the coliseum fighting ensues, the CGI becomes unbearably frequent &#8211; and is about as believable as the CGI used in Paul W. S. Anderson&#8217;s Resident Evil films.  If you&#8217;ve sat through other disaster flicks, like 2012 or Armageddon, then Pompeii will give off a similar feeling of disappointment with the over abuse of computer graphics.Overall, Pompeii is a film that will appeal more to Game of Thrones lovers and moviegoers that enjoy gladiator tales.  The story is far from unique, but that doesn&#8217;t stop it from being a semi-entertaining adventure flick.  It progresses at an intense pace and features plenty of action (even though most of it is noticeably fake).  Everlasting love is apparently the theme of the story, but by the time the credits roll, I suspect most viewers will feel as though they wasted their time watching a film that is filled with nothing more than death, disappointment, and shattered expectations.  $100 million is far too much to spend of the movie of this nature and even though it is an average &#8220;popcorn&#8221; film, the disappointing finale will leave the majority of viewers uttering, &#8220;that&#8217;s it?&#8221;GRADE:  C-FNDNreview.com"
"I'm not sure how any of these actors signed on to the project with the script they were given to read. The whole plot was a failed attempt at plagarizing every other &#34;forbidden love&#34; scenario ever seen in movies. The destruction was on par with the movie 2012, and really, it was the destruction you rooted for in the end. Oh, and when you get to the part about the chariot racing down the street, ignore the little things like how a 4 horse chariot could miraculously find a completely empty, near-debris-free road, or how it could outrace an earthquake, or even how it could make such a sharp turn that even most cars would flip on their sides to make. Ya...good script there....Like I mentioned in the title line, just mute the sound, turns the caps off, and enjoy the C.G.I. In the end I rooted for the volcano...and somehow I just don't think that was the feeling I should have been asked to feel. The movie did nothing to honor any of those lost to such a horrific death."
It's interesting to think about life in POMPEII on the fateful day Mount Vesuvius errupted and ended life in the thriving city. The movie POMPEII caught my attention and I was imagining a somewhat historical tale of love and life in the time of disaster.It seemed like the filmmakers took the idea of a volcano errupting and worked a fantastical tale around it that is as ordinary as they come. Gladiator slave falls in love with rich beautiful young lady who is pursued by an evil politician.  There is so much to tell about POMPEII and the lives of ordinary citizens and the frantic desperate moments when they realized they were doomed.Buffed and chisled Kit Harrington loses his family in Britain and ends up in Pompeii as a slave who is fighting gladiators in the arena. He's again Jon Snow from GAME OF THRONES only in a different setting and time period. He does his best and lovely Carrie-Ann Moss always is worth watching. Maybe more of their love story in a different setting would have been more exciting.Kiefer Sutherland is the evil Roman Senator and Sutherland plays his character with some sort of stilted Briish accent. Why do characters set in ancient Roman times always speak with British accents?It seems like POMPEII has a sprinkling of the STARZ series SPARTACUS with its gladiator theme. The main action begins in the last part of the film as Mount Vesuvius finally errupts. Here is where the real story should be given more attention as terrified and desperate people are trying to escape while others are resigned to their fates.I watched the bonus feature about the volcano and the filmmakers say they followed the writings of Pliny the Younger who was a witness to the disaster. They said they followed Pliny's description of the erruption and the effects on the Bay of Naples. Imagine people trying to flee by ship on the unforgiving waters.  Here would be a fascinating story and it is addressed to some degree. Some of the visual effects are great. Others look fake.An attempt was made to tell an interesting story in the time of disaster but the whole film falls apart.
"Okay. It's a new year so I can have a new WSF (Worst So Far), although I'm sure there will be even worse as the year goes on. As a rule, I find most clich&eacute;d situations to be diverting, but not the groaners in this thing. I'm sure the gales of laughter that met the finale were NOT what the director had in mind! (To be fair, sometimes a screening audience IS a tough sell.)Director Paul W.S. Anderson (&#34;The Three Musketeers&#34;) specializes in Computer Generated Imaging, so this actioner contains no surprises, but this bloodbath piled cruelty upon cruelty: lashings, bashings, smashings and slashings, so I kept my eyes covered and my yawns smothered much of the time. How many ways can they draw blood or cause mental anguish? (One couple actually brought a toddler. Okay, no profanity, so no harm.....)These folks have had better roles, but they give it their best:* Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (&#34;Thor: The Dark World&#34;) has our sympathy as the gladiator promised his freedom if he wins his last fight. Yeah... right...* Kit Harington (&#34;Game of Thrones&#34;) is our hero, a Celt with uncommon fighting skills, enslaved by Roman soldiers since childhood. Of course it's love at first sight when our heroine makes her entrance.* Emily Browning (&#34;Sucker Punch&#34;) is that puffy-lipped heroine. She is betrothed (unwillingly) to a Roman senator by her less-than-courageous father.* Jared Harris (&#34;Mad Men&#34;) is that father, who apparently backed the wrong politician and now has to make amends to the current powers that be.* Carrie-Anne Moss (&#34;Vegas&#34;) is his wife. At least she can see the political scene clearly, although there is very little she can do about it.* Kiefer Sutherland (Lots of TV) is the dastardly senator from Rome who lusts after our heroine and wants to invest in real estate in our fair city. (Pompeii was considered a resort town by the Romans.)No fight is worth watching unless there are insurmountable odds (which of course our hero surmounts) and lots of blood. And we only HEAR him break that horse's neck....I don't remember archaeologists mentioning a tsunami, do you? I thought it was pyroclastic (searing) blasts and ash-fall from Mount Vesuvius that killed the good folks in Pompeii. This morning I contacted someone who toured Pompeii and never heard a word about a tsunami. By the way, the plaster casts we associate with Pompeii were created when archaeologists injected a substance into the hollows in the solidified ash which were left after corpses decomposed.Expect lots of swordplay, spear thrusts, fist fights, earthquakes, a volcanic eruption, and a tsunami. Only one chaste little kiss though, and no sweaty bodies (PG-13). Whew!"
"I am a great fan of movies that deal with historical happenings, even if much liberty is taken with the films.  I am also an Historicalnut when it come to Roman History.  This movie is awfull...YES AWFULL!!  The history is shoddy, the cast lousy, and the actingterrible. Just another Roman bashing movie.  For one thing, the population (free men) were all Roman Citizens.  This film seemedto say they were not.  And any time anybody makes a film about Rome (from Hollyweird) the Romans are all evil and contributednothing to Western Civilization. The US constitution is in large part based in the Roman Republics constitution, even the architecturein DC is primarily Roman or styled after Roman buildings.  How about Roman Law, the basis of European and US law.  There aremany things I could mention but I should continue about this movie.  The story was STUPID, STUPID, STUPID!!!  I only gave thismess 2 stars (I was being generous!) because of the fine special effects, the reasonably accurate sets and the volcano eruptions.I will probably keep the DVD only because of the effects.  I did get this from Amazon.  I also got the 1984 version of  THE LASTDAYS OF POMPEII and will review it later when I finish.  Allready it seems much better, at least in story.  So if you like excellentspecial effects and like to watch a Roman city leveled, then I would reluctantly rent or buy the movie. But you better by someclothespins for your nose.  Or just scan ahead to the good parts.  enjoy!"
"It wasn't all that long ago or at least it feels that way, that Hollywood suddenly remembered the sword and sandal films of the sixties and began making them all over again. There were some great films made too, in particular GLADIATOR and TROY. Then the genre died out again or found itself taken over by ridiculously low budgeted reproductions of those popular films. It went back to the shelf. Now director Paul W.S. Anderson tries to bring it to life again with POMPEII. Unfortunately the film falls somewhere between those two types of films, the good and the bad.The story revolves around Milo who as a child watches as his parents and entire tribe of Celt horsemen are slaughtered by the Romans led by General Corvus (Keifer Sutherland) and his right hand man Proculus. Pretending to be dead, young Milo climbs from under the bodies of those who were slaughtered only to later be captured and placed into slavery.Years go by and Milo (Kit Harington) grows to be a fighter in ancient Britannia. When he catches the eye of one of the promoters for gladiatorial fights in Pompeii, he is taken back to that ancient city. Along the way he encounters Cassia (Emily Browning) when one of the horses pulling her carriage falls. He catches her eye not just because of his looks but because he puts down the horse in the most humane way possible.Cassia gets to Pompeii before the slaves on their way. It turns out that her father Severus (Jared Harris) is the ruler of the city. Severus is trying to promote the city into a minor version of Rome and is aided in doing so by his wife Aurelia (Carrie-Anne Moss). While pleased to see their daughter home once more they have yet to find out why she came back from Rome. That is explained later when now Senator Corvus arrives to negotiate with Servus for assistance to rebuild the city. Of course, he uses his desire to marry Cassia to eventually seal the deal.Meanwhile Milo finds himself in the slave quarters of the gladiators and a target of another slave whose brother he killed. While he survives that the odds of his surviving the arena are slim, even more so when the plan is to have him face off against his cell mate Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), a slave who is about to win his freedom if he defeats his 19th opponent. The pair square off during practice when an attempt is made once more on Milo only to be stopped by Atticus. While each knows they will one day face off against one another in the arena, a bond develops between the two.In the background of these stories is the mountain that rises above Pompeii that seems to be developing into eruption mode. Since we know the story of Pompeii there is little suspense formed by this except wondering just when it will finally blow.A change in plans in the arena has Milo and Atticus united to face off against the Romans. It's at this time that Corvus makes known his intentions for Cassia to her parents. It also happens to be when things begin to happen with the mountain filling the next 30-40 minutes with tons of special effects and carnage. Even with all of that happening a final face off between good guys and bad must take place.Shot using tons of green screen the movie does a good job of making you believe you're looking at an ancient city, but then again used as much as it is your belief starts to dwindle after a while. The explosive effects of the last portion of the movie are well made but at the same time stretch your ability to suspend belief as the main characters all just fall short of being engulfed in flames, fireballs, earthquakes or floods.The acting has no standouts here and is fair for the most part. Surprisingly the one performance that disappointed me the most was from Sutherland whose English accent in a movie set in ancient Rome falls flat. Browning's performance as Cassia lacks the depth and believability to carry off the story. Part of that is due to the love at first sight story telling that has her fall for Milo without any hesitation whatsoever.On the whole POMPEII isn't a terrible movie but it isn't a really good one either. It's one of those movies you probably won't be too disappointed in seeing if you like the genre, but not one that you'll want to revisit again after watching. As I watched the movie I kept thinking back to how great movies like SPARTACUS and GLADIATOR really were. When you think of another movie you want to see again while watching the one in front of you, it's not a sign of how good that movie is."
I thought this was about a volcano and chance of survival.  Gladiator vs. gladiator just didn't match the movie.  A waste of my time.
"Paul W. S. Anderson's &#34;Pompeii&#34; is a throwback to all those sword-and- sandal epics of yesteryear that combined period-piece spectacle with generous dollops of bloodletting, action and romance. This 1st Century soap opera just happens to take place in the shadow of Vesuvius, the volcano that famously erupted in 79 A.D., burying much of the city and its inhabitants in tombs of molten rock and ash.Looking like he barely needed a change of wardrobe from his day job, &#34;Game of Throne's&#34; Kit Harrington plays Milo, a Celtic boy who, after he witnesses his family being slaughtered by Roman troops in the northernmost region of the empire, is forced into slavery and raised to become a gladiator. When he's brought to Pompeii to fight in the arena, he catches the eye of Cassia (Emily Browning), a thoroughly anachronistic, sassy, forward-looking, freethinking type who finds the officials in Rome to be all uncouth barbarians and who has no taste for such popular blood-soaked pastimes as fight-to-the-death battles in the coliseum. A ludicrously miscast Keifer Sutherland plays a foul Roman senator who tries to come between the noble woman and the slave.As befits the genre, &#34;Pompeii&#34; is just chockablock with stock characters, cheesy dialogue and corny plotting, though the movie does earn a few points for its unlikely and, dare I say it, even quite brave finale.But, of course, anyone who checks out &#34;Pompeii&#34; will be doing so strictly to witness, albeit vicariously, all the death and destruction visited upon the city and its thousands of inhabitants when Vesuvius finally blows its top. Apparently, overproduced, CGI-infested disaster movies are our milder, modern-day equivalent to gladiatorial contests. And in that respect, at least, the movie delivers the goods.There's one thing that &#34;Pompeii,&#34; fortunately, doesn't have in common with those toga-wrapped spectacles of the past - and that is their extraordinary length. So clocking in at a relatively brief 104 minutes, &#34;Pompeii&#34; has at least one thing going for it."
"Pointless in the very end is all I can say about Pompeii. It really just seemed to go nowhere while trying to mix the ancient times stuff with the &#34;Oh no, it's gonna blow&#34; stuff."
"Pompeii is a movie about the last days and the destruction of the city by the volcano Etna.Although it is based on a historical fact, the rest is just a story, a scenario that is an amalgamationof various movies, especially a copy of the &#34;Gladiator.&#34;Because without the violence and the fighting it would have been a really boring movie anda box office failure.In contrast with other destruction movies, the destruction here is at the end, and there is not a lotof it time-wise. But the special effects are really good and make up for waiting through the movieto watch it. The tension builds really good and it is satisfying and it is the only reason towatch the movie.All in all, it is not a bad movie and you can watch happily any time of day"
"&#34;Almost Human&#34; is shorter than &#34;Cloverfield&#34; and has around an 8-minute end credit sequence solely to be long enough to be entered into the festival circuit. This may make it seem like the sci-fi horror film is rushed along, but its fast pace is actually fairly comfortable and it fits the film very well. The film draws influences from some of the most respectable cult classics. The opening credits and the film mostly taking place in the middle of the woods gives it a &#34;Friday the 13th&#34; atmosphere while the music seems like the forgotten score John Carpenter never released. As the film progresses, you're immediately reminded of &#34;The Thing&#34; and &#34;Halloween&#34; during the final act. The violent, murderous rampage also has some better than decent yet not quite great gore thanks to its practical makeup effects.It's difficult to root for Seth though because he's so twitchy. While Jen seems to have forgotten everything that happened the night Mark disappeared, Seth just wants to wake her up to the nightmarish sights and sounds he does remember. He isn't heroic and he doesn't want to save anyone. He just wants his life to go back to normal after Jen told the media that he was behind everything and it ruined his life. In other words, Seth only cares about himself.There's this entire sequence where Seth doesn't seem to understand anything anyone is telling him. He mutters the phrase, &#34;What's that supposed to mean,&#34; several times in less than five minutes. Mark always seems to ask questions without giving anyone a chance to actually answer. He asks a man cutting firewood why he's living in his house before blasting him with a shotgun and thrusting a hatchet into the back of his skull before the poor guy can give an actual answer. Seth is trying to load a rifle while Jen is in trouble. He&#8217;s rushed and in a panic, but can&#8217;t seem to get any of the shells into the actual gun. So he just throws the entire supply on the floor. While the film has several positive influences, the other influences aren't so great. &#34;Jason Goes to Hell&#34; is passable since the acting in that sequel is some of the best in the &#34;Friday the 13th&#34; series, but &#34;Almost Human&#34; is a lot like &#34;Dreamcatcher&#34; at the end of the day and that's something no film should try to ride the coattails of.&#34;Almost Human&#34; would be a decent first film for anyone, but its abrupt ending and familiarities hurt it more than anything else. Nothing is really explained by the end of the film and you're left wondering why aliens have a thing about turning our televisions on, making prank calls, turning the lights on and off, and possess impregnating elongated mouth funnels. While &#34;Almost Human&#34; pays homage to some truly great horror and sci-fi films of the past, it fails to really personify its own identity and it crumbles under the weight of paying too much homage without building its own foundation."
I watched all ten episodes. There are a couple very cool action scenes (both involving Don Johnson) but the rest of the series is very hard to get through. Unlikeable characters and bad writing. Very disappointing.
"I am a fan of Sister Wives and it seems like this family is too (at least Brady is) and have been watching them & practicing what to say on camera once they got their own show. I'm not sure if this was all Bradys idea & the wives are forced to go along with it (which seems the case with most things) or if they all just really were hoping that TLC would pay for some huge mansions like the Browns got (hence the push to move somewhere else from the first episode)?ALL of the wives seem so afraid to ""make waves"" that they are very obviously repressing almost all emotion especially in the presence of each other & their ""master"". Paulie looks like its affecting her the worst, the only time she really had a REAL smile seemed to be when they were drinking, the rest of the time when she does rarely smile they just seemed forced and sad. She may be forced to talk about the good side of her family life, but her anger and depression is written all over her face at all times.It really strikes a nerve with me EVERY time that Brady talks about what a ""beautiful thing"" polygamy is, of course its beautiful for you douche bag, you've got 5 different women taking care of ALL of your children FOR you and ""behaving themselves"" so that they wont be passed over to be the next one to beg at your feet for scraps of your limited attention. Of course YOU are happy, all your needs are being met while they all suffer in lonely depression. It seems like he has all these wives and children so that he has every excuse not to be personally responsible for any of them ""oh i'm sooooo busy but going to school for philosophy sounds like a good thing to waste some more time on""....seriously?! What an egotistical jerk! He cant even begin to open his eyes to see how much all of these women he says he ""loves"" are SUFFERING! Wake up dirt bag, while your talking about how ""beautiful"" everything is, they are talking about how hard it really is, their obviously painful jealousy, and trying desperately to get your attention ANY way they can think of it (adoption, pregnancy, weight issues, empty nest, holiday party, etc). For someone with so many women in his life, he doesn't seem to get them or want to understand them at all, or maybe he just doesn't want to face the fact that he is the single biggest source of pain in all of these womens hearts (oh sorry I mean ache, blah). Watching him time after time put the needs of his wives last & joking about things that make them all so uncomfortable is just horrible.Like the show is so aptly named ""MY five wives"", meaning its all about HIM and living his fantasy dream life. Why does HE get to be the one who decides if and where they will all move?! He acts like its a vote, but you can tell its not, like most everything else, its whatever will make HIM happiest. Why do a couple wives get to have the amount of children they want but the others have to beg and cry for their fair share? Were those other wives better ""behaved"" so they got what they wanted? Why does one get to adopt while another has to beg for a baby of her own? Why does one wife get called ""beautiful"" every day but the others have to beg for complements (especially the poor absolutely gorgeous full figured one)? If each of the adults have to cook dinner one day a week, why doesn't HE?! And how horrible of him to show up in the MIDDLE of his kids karate event (and the wife & child both seem soooo greatful for that 15min)what kind of father is that?! And why on earth are they all called ""aunt so & so"" to the children, they aren't aunts, they are MOTHERS of all of your children and should be given the name & respect that comes with it! Why is chatting it up with the guys at work so much more important than even remembering to show up to meet your wife for something YOU asked her to do for you?! How dare you take that woman for granted! Get a darn organizer or planner if its that hard for you to remember everything!I feel so sorry for the kids brought up in this environment, no wonder so many of them want to leave and cant wait to go live a normal life. Why would they want to live polygamy after growing up watching their moms suffer like this?! This show is just painful to watch. Yes, the Browns have their issues too but they don't seem afraid to confront them head on & together without obvious scripting. And yes Kody is an egotistical douche bag too, but at least he really does seem to TRY to be a better husband and father and at least he hasn't completely broken the spirit of 5 beautiful women. I will continue to watch only because I will be hoping with every fiber of my being that these women start to stand up for themselves & stop being such depressing lap dogs! Your so much better than that ladies!"
"What in the world are ""progressive polygamists,"" as the Williamses, the subjects of this series, claim to be? Seems like a contradiction in terms.Polygamy is not a progressive lifestyle by any means, never was and never will be. It's a male-centered lifestyle, in which all the women--and, in this case, 24 (!) children--fight for one man's attention. I can understand people practicing polygamy because it's their religious conviction to do so, as the Browns from Sister Wives claim, but the Williamses say they no longer hold true to the doctrines of Fundamental Mormonism, or the FLDS church. So they apparently now choose this lifestyle--or, as I see it, it's too late to change things. So now what?Are they stuck? Must be because what woman in her right mind would choose to share her husband with four other women if it's not something she believes will get her into heaven for time and all eternity? I wonder what this family is teaching the children.That it's OK for a man to have a number of women even though it's not dictated by their religion or condoned by society? (Do these ""progressives"" also believe it's OK for a woman to have multiple husbands?) And what religion do they now practice? Surely, there is no other Christian religion that is OK with polygamy. This family seems a bit of a jumble.A lot of reviewers claim the women, who are all cousins born in polygamous families in the same region of Utah in which the clan currently resides, appear to be depressed, and I would concur. Paulie is lovely, but she rarely cracks a smile and seems to not enjoy being in front of the camera. Rosemary is at least truthful. I like her honesty regarding jealousy and weight issues. Nonie is harsh, but seems bright. Rhonda and Robyn are kind and sweet but they too have that same glazed expression as the others.Several episodes into the season, we haven't learned much about the children, though. They're not really featured in the story lines and no one child stands out above the others. The boys tend to be unruly and it's understandable, as the family has no table around which to eat and mealtimes often become chaotic. Manners fall by the wayside. (You'd think contractor Brady could build one dining hall for the entire family to eat in instead of having to hold plates on laps.)Brady, who does not seem to be all that charismatic or appealing, tries to appease all the women. Of course that is impossible, we all know that. And every conversation when there's a problem or disagreement among the women or they with Brady seems staged. He seems to be reading from some conflict resolution handbook every time he answers them. He always says, ""I hear what you're saying,"" and then he repeats their grievance and gives some kind of wishy-washy answer but that is often just what the woman wants to hear. His responses, frankly, don't seem natural and I wonder if he would be so kind and understanding if the cameras weren't filming.Despite what appears to be playing to the cameras, some of the women claim that he is not always very fair--and it does appear that he has favorites--but how is it possible to love five women at once and be fair to everyone? It's the lifestyle in and of itself that doesn't promote fairness."
The show is diverting and interesting but seriously too light weight. Viewers are capable of dealing with much more depth than the show provides. A Brit would say the host is too cheeky for the subject matter!
"I liked the everyday language used, but I would have preferred more actual field work.  The camera work was jerky at times, unnecessarily so it seemed to me, I suppose it was to make the viewer feel like being part of the action.  It just annoyed me."
Different type of a way to introduce the subject at hand. Because of this I stayed to watch this episode but after got tired of the host being too intrusive that he started being the target of interest instead of the main subject.One episode was all I could take. The subject matter though was very interesting.Video quality awesome  Thanks Amazon!
"the program was too short, needs to be an hour, and he stretches the science and it seems like information is left out"
The subject matter is fascinating but the series narrator and travel guide is not.  His goal seems to be to prove that parts of the Bible are literally true in an historical sense.  This is fine but he isn't.
"I was bored and looking for something to watch. Even as bored as I often am, this show is not worth it. Its not an individual episode show, its more 24 with ones plot and increasing complications. And a lot of characters to keep track of. One detail that stood out and bugged me was Gillian Anderson. She's a wonderful actress, who I remember X-Files. Blond does not work."
"The cast and the previews looked worth watching...I watched episode 1 and within the first sequence I knew what was going to happen and I knew who was the &#34;bad guy&#34;. Dermot Mulroney, who plays the bad guy, looks terrible... dirty and dingy and not-watchable.The premise is stupid. I am to believe that a group of teenagers whose parents are the most powerful and influential in the country (including the president's son), ALL are on a bus... a &#34;normal&#34; field trip... WITH only two secret service vehicles following them and no other security to be found... AND no security ON the bus... AND a crazy ex-FBI (or other 3-letter word agent) is on the bus with them. Seriously! First, isn't a secret service agent to be WITH the president's kid at ALL times, WITH him, by his side, ON the bus? Second, none of these other high-powered people have security around their kids at all... and third, a field trip, a freaking field trip. Where the hell where they going? What field trip with 16-17 year olds? WHERE ARE THEY GOING?And... a secret service agent is suppose to lay down his life for the president and his family. They are NOT to be compromised. But oh... wait... if I buy into this premise, of course they are easily compromised.That premise within itself made me roll my eyes. Then it gets better... &#34;send the other vehicle ahead to secure the restaurant for lunch&#34; yeah, the one other secret service vehicle... WHAT?... oh, but wait.. it gets better... the other vehicle disappears then there is a road block... AND... let's get out of our vehicles and NOT secure the president's son and just see what's going on... WHAT?All of that in the first 15 minutes... I'm suppose to buy that... but oh...I find out that the show is going to be centered around a bunch of teenagers... ummm... no.Gillian Anderson, bless her heart... she looks good but that's about it. No emotion... none! And she did have a line for that something about... &#34;I'm not going to be this way for long&#34;... WHAT?oh... but wait... the bad guy, is of course, the BEST at what he does... which I guess is controlling everything thru his computer setup... and the FBI (or some other 3-letter agency) just fired him for something that he, of course, did not do, and let him go on his merry way.One positive note: The storyline with the new-to-the-job secret service agent was pretty good. IF I watched the show again it would be to see how he saves the day, which is where it is seemingly headed. I was engaged with this part. I wanted to see what he would do to save the boy and himself.I didn't care about the rest of the story. I just wanted it to be over. However, the series could be saved. If I was writing it, I would get the teenagers rescued in the second episode so that little teen drama is over. Kill the supposed bad guy and find that he was actually working for someone else so there are is a &#34;real&#34; bad guy. And have a storyline in there of how the secret service and the FBI screwed up. But the remainder of the show would be the FBI against this new bad guy and of course, saving the day.Anyway, this is bad. I could probably pick apart every scene. The suspense is forced. The story itself should produce the suspense. Suspense is not just drawing out a situation, making us wait wait wait for an outcome that we know is coming.At the end of the episode the bottom line seemed to be... what would you do to protect your child?... Well, it didn't seem that any of those high-powered parents did very much to protect their child by putting them on a bus for a field trip with no protection. So I guess the answer is... not so much... along with my rating."
"As a fan of political dramas, I decided to give &#34;Crisis&#34; a try because it looked like a very interesting premise.  Plus, being an X-Files junkie, I was curious about Gillian Anderson's return to network TV.  Those assumptions did hold...for about two episodes.  After that, unfortunately, the show turns into a standard crime procedural lacking any sort of &#34;new ground&#34;.After the first two episodes of &#34;Crisis&#34;, I thought that I had found the next great political drama.  A group of high-society prep students on a school field trip (one being the son of the President of the United States) are kidnapped and held hostage.  It is very interesting to see the different dynamics between the students and how they all react a little bit differently to the situation.  Even the heavily-advertised Gillian Anderson return is a hit, as her character adds a toughness angle to the show that seems intriguing.Sadly, that is where the innovation of this show ends.  For the next 3/4 episodes, it turns into a complete procedural.  It has the stereotypical &#34;one male, one female F.B.I. agent&#34; (played by Lance Gross & Rachael Taylor) premise, and follows a &#34;one parent of a hostage each week&#34; approach to storytelling.  It is sad, because had the show-runners been able to focus on the relationships between the teen hostages themselves, THAT is where the interesting material was.  As soon as the focus shifted to the parents, it became tedious and un-inspiring.  Even Anderson's character has been pretty much in invisible since those first couple episodes.I compare &#34;Crisis&#34; to a show like &#34;Intelligence&#34; on CBS.  Both shows had great kernels of concepts/ideas, but instead of truly breaking ground with original storytelling, the networks instead shoe-horn those interesting plots into tired TV storytelling conventions.  Both shows were also advertised as something almost completely different from what they turned out to be.  Much like &#34;Intelligence&#34;, I would be surprised if &#34;Crisis&#34; gets a renewal for a second season.  It just doesn't differentiate itself enough from other similar &#34;stock&#34; fare on television these days."
"RAMONA SINGER IS REPULSIVE. When is someone just going to kick her ass! She deserves NOTHING BUT: the misery she inflicts upon others with her obnoxious irrational behavior that is downright unacceptable! She is a violent, CRAZY OLD B***H that should be removed from the show. EXPIRATION=UP!I'd like to see her get on Heather's bad once more..., maybe Ramona will finally get what's coming to her."
Pros:Acting and filming were ok.Some of the plot points were ok - who doesn't like extra-normal abilities?Cons:Girl was annoying and her actions would get people killed.Show also has a definite naive pacifistic slant - which is a major negative. One of the characters actually says &#34;We're good guys so we don't use guns.&#34; Oh please! Real good guys use what's necessary to protect the innocent.The whole &#34;save the musician/writer/poet because their words will change the world&#34;  thing has been done to death.Might watch another episode or two but not many more if it keeps the same direction.
"I usually wait a while to watch a new series until I know whether it's been renewed or cancelled.  This was cancelled yesterday, May 9th (along with my favorite sitcom Community).  I watched quite a few episodes, and it's bad.  Even by JJ Abrams standards, though it's not as bad as Revolution.The plot is as follows:  The girl (Bo) has psychic abilities off the charts and she was 'rescued' from a government project that may have been trying to develop her as a weapon.  Bo's ""rescuers"" reunite her with her dad, who was on death row.  The reason he was on death row was completely resolved half a dozen episodes later.  The evil director of the facility that was studying Bo wants her back and they enlist the FBI-- the sole presence of which is a youngish brunette in a pony tail.  That's the back story.In nearly every episode:1.  Their safe house gets compromised and they have to flee2.  Bo gets a vision about a normal person who needs help.  She tugs and tugs on her father's arm until he gives in.. reluctantly.3.  The 'bad guys' enlist a psychic to find her or turn on a psychic machine that reads psychic emissions (wtf?)4.  Bo and her dad hug the people they save5.  The bad guys are shown to have another ace up their sleeveThey state at the onset that Bo needs a normal childhood because she is so powerful she could bring peace to the world.  However, nobody shows a trace of growth.  Every person's personality is completely fixed and no experience changes anyone, even slightly.JJ Abrams isn't even trying anymore.  He comes up with a plot (this time shamelessly ripped off from Touch), and cranks out a dozen poorly thought out episodes before being handed another series (and the reins to both Star Trek and Star Wars).  When I see JJ Abrams name on a series, I know I'm getting a polished turd.  I feel like I spent more time on my review than JJ Abrams did with the series.And from certain angles, that girl is a dead ringer for a skinny Honey Boo Boo."
"Bo is a supernatural, extraordinary girl with psychic powers. The problem is many groups and authorities are after her and each one of them wants to use her for their own devices wither it's evil or good. Now, Winter the closest thing Bo had to a father figure has been trying to protect her from falling in the wrong hands. In order to do so, he frees Tate an ex convict from Prison and asks him to guard Bo and make sure she stays safe.And so they hit the road, except it's really difficult for them to stay unnoticed considering how the police are looking for Tate and they are also looking for Bo. There's a lot of twists and turns into the story and it's only been 4 episodes out so far.Personally, this show isn't all terrible, it has it's decent moments it could be entertaining on a boring school/work night. However, the characters are so unlikable it's daunting and the plot isn't all that solid to compensate for that fact. Bo especially is the worse, she's very annoying and I have no idea why she even needs to be protected by anyone. Every single time they get into trouble or Tate gets almost caught by the police she seems very capable of helping herself and everyone around her out of the situation with her magical super powers. She also is extremely obnoxious and a know it all.Tate on the other hand is your typical bad boy image who is everything but ... I think the producers failed on creating that one. He's a criminal so obviously that gives him a sense of danger but he was also wrongfully accused and to be honest he seems so lost in the whole thing. Like he just doesn't know what he wants to do with his life.Winter is also annoying. He spends most of his time protecting Bo and he even quits from his job, isolates himself from his family just to protect Bo from those so called evil organisations that want her in their team. A bit too extreme? don't you think maybe he could've sent her some other country away from all of this instead of having to follow her around till eternity? I get he's doing the noble thing but his character is too good to be true.The rest of the cast are equally annoying."
"This felt very derivative and uninspired.  Yet another spooky, extraordinary child on the run from the government and/or emotionless European assassins.  Yawn."
I have just seen to much about this subject.  I just was not interested in keeping up a weekly show about this subject
"There are a handful of directors who have created such buzz surrounding their distinct voices that there is talk about them, their films and their methods with every film, before, after and even long after he&#8217;s moved on to something else.  Lars von Trier is probably the king of this.  Since his start in the early 90&#8217;s, von Trier has graced audiences (small audiences, but audiences) with his perverse and often shocking depictions of sexuality, sexism and masochism.  Sometimes, he finds ways to shade his own ideas, philosophies, theories and musings with enough style and depth to make them feel warranted, making the shock of it all carry the weight it needs to sit on our palate.And then other times he just shows us a lot of pictures of genitals and expects us to feel something other than repulsion.Now, I&#8217;ve been a longstanding champion of von Trier and his vision.  While others have tossed many disparaging remarks his way and have taken arms against some of his more recent films, I&#8217;ve stood my ground and played devil&#8217;s advocate in his favor.  &#8216;Antichrist&#8217; was a pretty disturbing film, but when all was said and done there was an underlying purpose to von Trier&#8217;s madness, and while it didn&#8217;t all translate how he would have liked (or at least how the audience would have liked) there is no denying that von Trier had a pretty bold narrative and some pretty confident points to entertain, and the core performance from Charlotte Gainsbourg was astonishingly grounded in the context of the film (such a fearless performance, through and through).I can&#8217;t defend this.&#8216;Nymphomaniac: Vol. 1 & 2&#8217; is basically a four hour film that recounts a young woman&#8217;s many, many, many sexual trysts.  Pretending to exploit (here we go again with exploitation in film) the double standard that abounds within the treatment of men and women, especially in a sexual context, &#8216;Nymphomaniac&#8217; confuses all of its own ideals in a strange hodgepodge of &#8216;chapters&#8217; that drone on and on and ultimately take us nowhere.  Opening with a beaten young woman named Joe being helped off the street by the neighborhood psychiatrist, Seligman, and then delving into the depths of carnal lusting and abuse, &#8216;Nymphomaniac&#8217; is probably one of the most self-absorbed and self-indulgent films I&#8217;ve ever had the displeasure of seeing.I think that Lars von Trier has a deep-seated interest in uncovering the depths of a woman&#8217;s psyche.  I don&#8217;t think that he is a misogynist at all.  In fact, I tend to side with Uma Thurman on this subject:&#8220;He&#8217;s a very provocative filmmaker, but he writes women with more depth and respect and complexity than most writers.  The idea that people debate whether he&#8217;s a misogynist?  People should debate whether people who don&#8217;t even write women are misogynist.  The fact is, he&#8217;s dedicated a large portion of his artistic life to the exploration of the female psyche&#8212;good and bad, light and dark, shadows, textures.  The fact that he&#8217;s dedicated a huge part of his talents to that, to me, defies the concept that he doesn&#8217;t have respect, interest, and genuine compassion in women.  People should question writers that don&#8217;t even give a d*** about a female character.  They are the misogynists.&#8221;Sadly, this respect and intrigue isn&#8217;t seen very well here at all.  Instead, &#8216;Nymphomaniac&#8217; feels about as misogynist as they come, and at the end of the day it&#8217;s even worse than that; the film feels just plain trashy.  Lars von Trier has built a career out of shock value, but his shocking contributions to film have always felt grounded in a linier plot or at least in an idea that has sprouted into madness, but a clear idea at the core.  Most of &#8216;Nymphomaniac&#8217; feels nonsensical and devoid of rational narrative, and while he tries to find some footing in the film&#8217;s final throws, he never establishes anything concrete within Joe&#8217;s story to hook us to her, to latch onto us and so it all winds up feeling rather misguided.There is a point here, but von Trier doesn&#8217;t know what it is.Instead, von Trier treats us to a young girl&#8217;s dissention into depravity.  She prostitutes herself for sexual pleasure at a very young age, playing games with her best friend and even forming a club that&#8217;s primary focus was to rack up sexual partners, never forming a lasting relationship with anyone (no one lay to be repeated), and Joe recounts her story with absolutely no emotion, as if none of it matters (because it doesn&#8217;t) and Seligman tries to liken her whorish behavior to numbers and fish while she relates it all to her dying father and an ash tree; and while Joe is pretending she&#8217;s falling in love with Shia LaBeouf (because that could never happen for real), volume 1 ends and volume 2 begins and this is where things get dicey.  Sexual pleasure is lost, which leads to Joe finding her own personal Fight Club and hiring translators to hook her up with Africans and before we know it, Joe has become a Soprano and is grooming a freaky eared nymph to take her place, and her man.And then Seligman takes off his pants.There is so much going on here and yet none of it ever feels necessary.  It is all just there to make your eyes hurt (they will hurt) and the film&#8217;s primary point seems to center on how Joe&#8217;s disturbing actions are all validated because men are disgusting pigs and she is living in the repressed guilt of her of desires, but it&#8217;s not that simple and yet von Trier never steps back from his own visual shockfest long enough to try and actually develop these themes.  Instead he&#8217;d rather show us a bunch of genitalia and sexual acts and then force feed us a finale that feels appropriate ONLY because the film pretty much sets us up for a cop-out ending.There is such a thing as being bold and fearless, and &#8216;Nymphomaniac&#8217; is both of those things, but it is also soulless and hollow, and when you are both of THOSE things, bold and fearless will only harm you."
"If you really want to see a psychological character study on nymphomania, watch the movie Shame, directed by Steve McQueen. This movie was laborious on every level. So, why the two stars? Uma Thurman! She was the one bright spot in this entire dark mess. Her 10 minute performance was perfection!Maybe Part 2 will reveal  more, but sadly, I won't waste my time seeing it. I enjoy Lars Von Trier's other works, this one was a huge disappointment. First comparing her disease with fly fishing. Then the short vignettes with the mother and father. A little more needed to be brought out in this movie to help explain why Jo is the way she is.Don't waste your time on this, watch Shame instead!"
"It has an interesting premise, but struggles to find its legs. First it is a want-a-be Lord of the flies, but then acts more like Earth 2, if the character were teenagers. The more interesting story is still in space, but that side of the story reads like the first draft of Battlestar...actually that is too nice.It is something to watch when there is nothing better on. The acting is second-rate, the plot weak, and the imagination dull."
"To be fair to the supporters and the critics  i tried to like this show.I watched it for the first time at the insistence of a friend who said you will love it, but sadly no i didn't.An unbelievable story line is the first thing that grabbed me, jump to a failing space station who sends a group of kids that have never even seen a tree a stream or felt sunshine to a planet ravaged by radiation after only 90 something years to fend for themselves with no food and no weapons.they then crash onto the planet and things go from bad to worse, pick out the one African American dude and lets persecute him and then kill him over and over again, but trust me its gets far worse.With no weapons they then begin to hunt Animals who have been mutated from exposure to radiation and they do this with clubs and spears ,what have you. after they themselves are already weakened by no food and very little water.  some of the worst acting i have ever seen combined  with so many holes in the plot its like a cheese grater and this fails big time.  i can't believe someone wrote this  and it was published  .. can anybody say Terra Nova"
Ten bodice ripper
I didn't think the acting was very good.  I wouldn't recommend this series to my family or friends.  Story too typical.
"I hate writing bad reviews, but honestly I couldn't get past the first episode.  If you're a teen/pre-teen I guess it might be fun.  I thought the premise was great but watching the production/acting and shallow characters turned me off immediately.  I hope to god sci-fi (which is already difficult to pull off) doesn't go further down this road."
"Quick Overview: After a nuclear crisis the human race took to space for hundreds of years. Running out of resources they have quickly developed a one-strike rule for criminals. Any violation is grounds for death. Taking a chance officials sent a group of 100 jailed teens to test Earth. They hope it is once again life sustaining. Humanity depends on it.The promise of the plot is phenomenal. The delivery however is lacking. So far it has turned out to be just another drama aimed at teens. There is a bit of romance and hormones mixed with survival and power struggle. Not anything new.The season is still early so I hope the story telling steams ahead. Otherwise, it just turns into another one of many."
"So Resurrection had a predictably strong opening on network TV and why wouldn't it? Set upon the immediately gripping concept of loved ones returning from the dead, the promise of the premise is strong, surely guaranteeing to hit the sweet spot in the Venn diagram of mystery, fantasy and horror. Yet week after week, ABC misses the mark on the show failing to fire on any of the dramatic cylinders that are clearly primed to compete with the ratings juggernaut of the Walking Dead. How could they have messed this up?As once-dead residents of the IQ-challenged town of Arcadia start to reappear, it's extraordinary that the least realistic aspect of the show is not the resurrection itself but the staggeringly dumb reaction of any of the characters. Any normal human would ask thousands of questions, wonder if they're zombies, call the Feds, get extensive medical tests, check the coffins for the bodies, go to pray, start a conspiracy theory website, leave the town - anything, literally anything along these lines that the show refuses to do.Ignoring the vastly obvious pit of story opportunities, the writers are hell-bent on forcing the story logic into a police procedural yet even the cops and thinly-painted medical characters act like they were trained at the same police academy as the FBI from The Following. Instead of taking action on singly the biggest event in recorded history, they do literally nothing and each week the story inches along at glacial speed to the point where I wonder if they remember that these people were dead. It's almost as if the writers are scared of the plot and have just set up a bunch of generic drama moments hoping for something interesting to happen.In my weekly frustration with this show, I finally decided to check out Les Revenants (The Returned) which was a French spin on the idea made a couple of years ago. Cliched as it may sound, this is unfortunately one of those cases where the French original series is so much better that you wonder how the US remake could be so bad. Les Revenants sets up a spooky mystery with a well-selected range of engaging characters, approaching the question of whether the Returned are good or malevolent out to destroy the living without ever becoming ridiculous, giving us some first class acting, dialog and subtle plotting along the way.Resurrection meanwhile is doing none of this and by episode 5 is seriously threatening to jump the shark. Suffering from some of the most unimaginative writing in television today and maybe a network that doesn't know which theme and story threads to follow, it's wasting one of the best story concepts in a long time. Rather than spending countless hours for ABC to find the plot, you can just cue up Netflix and enjoy something vastly superior in The Returned - while you have to wade through English subtitles, it's better than waiting for anything to happen in this really bland execution of a great concept."
"I wasn't thrilled by the movie. The dialogue needs a lot of work. It just wasn't that funny. The family was too much. I can't imagine the dad being unemployed six months, hiding it from his wife, being so broke and still going on vacation. I might be able to believe a shorter length of time unemployed and hiding it. But the dad didn't understand GPS yet could pull off hiding six months unemployment? The mom was the smart one yet she had no idea the finances of her family before a major vacation? She had no idea for 6 months her husband had no job and wasn't paying the bills off? The daughter wasn't even likable. I just didn't get this family and couldn't care about them or relate to any of them. I wouldn't pay to see this. I do think it may be tweakable though. Someone mention a budget Hawaiian vacation. I could see this being pulled off with the dad coming clean about where they are with his unemployment and finances. Then a budget vacation maybe being planned by mom and dad for the kids, who had been promised a trip to Hawaii. Once there, the dad gets caught up in the adventure of the stolen statue. It would be possible to make something from that but characters would need makeovers. Dad could be slightly more aware of technology like GPS, knows about it but is not really tech savvy so he bungles it. Mom could be a bit more savvy on the families finances but loves Dad enough to hide his unemployment and their financial state for one last hurrah for the children. The children could be who they are but without nastiness like calling Dad names when he just forked over Hawaii. It has potential to be a family fun movie but as is falls flat."
This catoon has to much rambling about nothing and it needed more constriction on the heist. The value of the statue should have been made known from the start and who or what organization was behind it and why. The daughter was not polite in calling her father a wiedo. Good luck!
I ordered it by mistake. So I did not watch it. I don't like horror type movies. To each his own I guess.
"At the age of 34, Aaron Paul is quite the accomplished actor &#8211; at least on the small screen.  You may catch him here and there in various roles, but for the most part, Paul is best known for his outstanding performance in the AMC drug drama, Breaking Bad.  For five years, Paul portrayed the quirky Jesse Pinkman, and earned himself several prominent awards, along with a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  However, with Breaking Bad having reached its conclusion, it only seems like a natural decision for Paul to try his luck on the big screen.  However, not every successful TV actor translates well to the grander stage of film.  And, if Need for Speed is any indication about the direction of Paul&#8217;s future in film &#8211; he might want to start rethinking his character choices&#8230;Directed by Scott Waugh (Act of Valor) and based on the popular Electronic Arts video game, Need for Speed stars Aaron Paul as a garage owner and former racecar driver, Tobey Marshall.  He, along with a handful of his closest friends, run the garage &#8211; but Tobey has a hard time finding the money to keep it open.  He occasionally takes part in street races for side money, yet it&#8217;s never enough to maintain a level of financial comfort.After successfully winning his latest street race, Tobey and his team are approached by Tobey&#8217;s old rival, Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper) &#8211; a famed driver and car tycoon.  Prior to his death, car creator Carol Shelby had been working on a special, supped-up version of the Shelby Mustang, however, he wasn&#8217;t able to complete his work.  Brewster enlists Tobey to complete the Mustang, at which point he will pay them a quarter of the car&#8217;s worth &#8211; between two and three million dollars.  But, egos get in the way and during a street race between Tobey and Dino &#8211; tragedy lands Tobey in jail for a crime he didn&#8217;t commit.After doing time in jail, Tobey openly breaks parole and heads from New York to California &#8211; but not before enlisting the help of high-end car dealer, Julia Maddon (Imogen Poots).  She is able to lend him the same Shelby Mustang from his partnership with Dino and he plans to use it to race Dino in a private, invitation only winner-take-all street race &#8211; coordinated by an internet racing guru, Monarch (Michael Keaton).  Tobey also has revenge on the mind and plans to prove his innocence while taking Dino down in the process.In the spirit of the Fast and the Furious franchise, Need for Speed attempts to establish characters with a heavy dose of racing in their backdrop.  Unfortunately, Need for Speed doesn&#8217;t present a substantial alternative to the Fast franchise, featuring generic individuals that supposedly have credibility, egos, and reputations &#8211; but only because they are force-fed to the audience without substantiated proof.  Even the dialogue between the characters is bothersome, as they spend far too much time and effort rattling off bland one-liners and partaking in soap opera-ish melodrama.For someone as talented as Aaron Paul, he is terribly under utilized in the lead role of this lackluster plot.  In fact, I dare say Paul is not ready to be a lead actor based on the result of this film.  He goes from a supremely popular television drama to a disappointing undertaking &#8211; and it&#8217;s hard to imagine a role of this nature helping him further his career.  His character comes off as a bit of fraud &#8211; and at times, his delivery is terribly fake.  Even Paul&#8217;s alleged rivalry with the film&#8217;s villain, portrayed by Dominic Cooper, is dependent on false, over-embellished egos and the chemistry is just not there.  Obviously, most of us know Paul is a credible actor, meaning the writing is where the fault lies in this presentation.Meaningful character interaction is completely sacrificed for the sake of adding a near endless about of car chases &#8211; inevitably causing more cut scenes of which the eye is able to keep track.  There are quite a few outstanding cars worth your admiration in this flick, including the decked-out Shelby Mustang GT500, plus the Lamborghini Sesto Elemento, and Koenigsegg Agera R.  But, it obviously wouldn&#8217;t be a racing movie until they were all prominently wrecked at high speed &#8211; except for the Koenigsegg, which is ridiculously important to the outcome of the far-fetched story.Regardless of how this film plays our, the countless holes in the plot are undeniable.  In one particular scene, Tobey&#8217;s team is traveling next to him in a truck in order to refuel his car, so he doesn&#8217;t have to stop and lose any more precious time (as if it takes more than just a couple of minutes to fill-up).  In any event, mere moments later Tobey and his passenger, Julia (who apparently has nothing better to do than to go on joy-rides with convicts), randomly stop for gas.  Before, time was of the essence, but now it&#8217;s okay to stop?  Come on?  Seriously?  Naturally, there&#8217;s a police office just happens to be in the gas station parking, who predictably chases them around for a few minutes.  Go figure.Overall, Need for Speed as downright ridiculous in every possible manner of thinking &#8211; even more so than the Fast franchise.  In the real world, Tobey Marshall would have been quickly apprehended in OJ Simpson fashion, but the odds of him going to jail for his alleged &#8220;crime&#8221; in the first place is next to nothing anyway (since there&#8217;s traffic cameras everywhere these days).  This terribly scripted film does a marvelous job of making decent actors look like daytime television actors &#8211; not to mention there is absolutely nothing about this film that drastically ties itself to the popular video game franchise (and video game film adoptions have a history of being terrible to begin with).  About the only reason you should see this film is if you&#8217;re a diehard fan of Aaron Paul or simply like to see eye-popping, ridiculously fast cars.GRADE: D+FNDNreview.com"
"1.  Will there ever be a great video game adaptation?The other day, I read on a film blog that Splinter Cell finally grabbed a director (Doug Liman) and lead (Tom Hardy), which gives me hope...but it's really a mind bender that there hasn't ever been a great movie based on a video game.  I mean, some video games have incredible stories and cinematic element, and somehow they just don't transfer well on film.  Now, just reading months back that there would be a Need for Speed film made me roll my eyes, and I wasn't looking at this movie as the 'great hope' for video game to film greatness, but I was hoping that whoever wrote Need for Speed wouldn't treat it's audience like complete morons.2.  Aaron Paul elevates whatever material he's given.If I'm being honest (along with my wife, and probably thousands of others who shelled out their hard earned cash to see Need for Speed), the only reason I went to see this was because of Aaron Paul.  His turn as Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad was one of the most gut wrenching, heart pulling performances of all time, and any time I have the opportunity to see him do his thing on screen, I'm going to be there.  He was trying so hard with the material here, and despite the utter crap he's got to say on screen, he still manages to pull it off.  I have to tip my cap to Aaron Paul.  Such a talented actor.3.  They let you play with iPads in military prison.If there's one thing I learned from Need for Speed, it's that they have spare laptops laying around in hospitals and iPads in the brig.  At one point, a character is in a MILITARY PRISON, and casually asks a female guard (who clearly isn't interested) for an iPad to follow his buddy during an illegal race on what must be a cleverly designed app (found easily on the App store, I'm sure) - either that or it's just a website that anyone could hop onto and follow the race (paying attention, cops?).  So what does she do?  She grabs an iPad from the ol' Army surplus of iPads and connects to the Wi-Fi (again, in military jail) so that he can fist pump while his friend blows through traffic.4.  The racing scenes were awesome.The plot was so dumb, and makes absolutely no sense.  However, if you're going to see Need for Speed, you're really going for two reasons - Aaron Paul and the car chases, and let me tell you...the racing scenes delivered.  The roar of the engine, the skidding of tires, the exotic cars, they all looked beautiful.  They were shot amazingly and the lack of CGI really showed.  There was a great amount of effort into making the car scenes as cool as they were, and it paid off.  And that Mustang...that Mustang...it really made me miss mine.5.  This plot was so dumb, and makes absolutely no sense.Yeah, this is a car movie, but it's still a movie, right?  Up until our hero gets out of prison, I was with this plot.  Sure, the dialogue was hokey, and everyone on Aaron Paul's racing team came across as if they wanted to date him, but I was with it.  Then, it went completely off the rails.  When he gets out of prison, his plan is to enter this super secret race to get revenge against Dominic Cooper's villain character.  Exactly how though?  At this point, he doesn't even know if Cooper is in said race (and actually, he wasn't at that point).  Somewhere in there, the villain also enters the race, because he runs a failing auto dealership and needs a few more cars?  Also, can we address the fact that Kid Cudi plays a pilot who can fly anything...and does?  He randomly shows up in planes, news helicopters and at one point, an Apache, like he calmly goes to a rent-a-whateveryouneedforthisscene, and there he is, in the sky without difficulty.  Or Michael Keaton's character, who apparently puts this race on every year, who just broadcasts everything from his living room and is never caught...because...why?  This script really goes the extra 3,000 miles to insult the audience with stupidity.If you're looking for a movie where you need to check your brain at the door...or completely chuck it out of a McLaren going 200mph, this is the movie for you.  My suggestion?  Wait until it hits Netflix and fast forward through the garbage that isn't car racing."
"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.Scott Waugh brings the successful video game to the big screen.  I expect the film be in the running for worst film of the year.  I was lured in to see some cool cars (especially the Shelby Mustang), some cool driving sequences and wasn't expecting much else.  There was one surprise.  A pretty good soundtrack which for me was highlighted by Jamie Common's version of Dylan's ""All Along The Watchtower.""  So I was satisfied with my reason for going.  But still, I love movies and was expecting something more than this claptrap.The so called plot consists of garage owner, Tobey Marshall (Aaron Paul) a wannabe race car driver agreeing to spruce up a Mustang owned by his high school nemesis, Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper).  Dino has gotten hands on the Mustang being developed by Ford and Carroll Shelby that wasn't finished after Shelby died.  Once Tobey and his misfits of a crew fix up the car, they would get a quarter of the sales price, expected to be in the neighborhood of $3 million.In a just-for-fun match race between Tobey, Dino and a close friend (Harrison Gilbertson) of Tobey's who also happens to be Dino's girlfriend's younger brother and she happens to be the former girlfriend (Dakota Johnson) of Tobey's.  Well, high speeds on city streets can be dangerous and you guessed it, something bad happens. This all leads to an eventual big-balls-takes-all-shootout in northern California and Tobey and his now sold Mustang's new owner's associate Julia (Imogen Poots), now must cross country to get to the big 6 car race where the winner gets all the cars.This story is so full of holes it's just absurd.  About every 5 minutes something really dumb happens.  Here's an example.  Since Tobey is behind schedule, he decides to gas up while on the fly.  His compatriots are always nearby in a truck that somehow manages to keep up with the 230 mph Mustang.  So this little bit of putting gas in the tank while flying down the freeway, is followed a few scenes later with them stopping to get gas and allow Julie to change clothes or something.If you must, see it for the cars...and there are some beauties including a Bugatti, GTA Spano, Lamborghini Gallardo, Mercedes-Benz McLaren, McLaren P1, etc. and some great stunt driving."
"The acting really needs work here! That's my #1 criticism for this movie! This movie doesn't make me believe and if I don't believe them, how in the world will I like it? I won't. I just kept thinking, they're not really playing their roles well. They didn't take me away from reality and the terrible poor acting.Okay, so what do I like in this movie. I liked the police car chases and the races with all the other sports cars. I also liked how they were great at trying to adapt the video elements into the movie. I feel they were heavily influenced by the ""Need For Speed Hot Pursuit series"". And finally, I liked the hot main actress. That's pretty much all I liked about the movie.I can tell you that this movie was better than ""Getaway, 2013"" with Ethan Hawke and Selena Gomez. That movie was just terrible, so give them a hand folks?! *Slow and quite clapping*Okay, so if you want to see a good racing movie though, you can watch Fast and the Furious 1, 2, or 3. Don't watch any other Fast and the Furious movie after 3 because those ARE NOT about racing.I thought this movie could had been the best, if they got better main actors and had a way better story. Forget the tragic lost of a friend and just keep the love story and rival plot. That would had make it slightly better. As for the main male actor, he really doesn't know how to act! It just got to distracting seeing him on the screen trying to become his character. He seemed too unstable with his emotions all the time. Every other min, happy, sad, depressed, basically all over the map. Throw that guy out!Yes, I think you people should watch this movie, but no need to buy it. It's not a keeper movie."
"A small fraction into this film, the heroine was numb and so was I.  After a race-baiting if not racist-in-context threesome, the lovingly rendered scenes of bloody S&M;, and escalating, I was expecting a beheading by the end of it all.  It was worse.  The two final confrontations were what led me to believe the film was against all that is good, or maybe just against all that is.  The film delighted in erasing any positive sentiment it had accidentally cultivated-- or maybe it cultivated positive sentiments for the sole purpose of annihilating them.So our heroine--or hero, since she calls her Joe and not Jo-- is against love (stated in Volume I) and against the sentimentality of motherhood (stated in Volume II).  I champion neither, but if the alternative is this ceaseless funfest, then love and motherhood start to look positively enlightened.  I mean, come on, we all had the young adult `this-can't-be-it' moment, so when Joe deadpans: ""Perhaps the only difference between me and other people is that I've always demanded more from the sunset. More spectacular colours when the sun hit the horizon. That's perhaps my only sin."" we can indulge her, until we realise she is completely serious, and humourless in general.Volume I gave us the fishing, maths and music analogies.  Volume II has nowhere to go but religion, so we have Western (Roman Catholic) vs. Eastern (Orthodox) Churches and The Transfiguration.  By this time, the analogies seem more compulsive and excessive than our nymphomaniac.Then Seligman says something to the effect `Being anti-Zionist is not the same as being anti-Semitic,' a completely unnecessary thing to say.  And then Joe with her `negro' comment.  That was part of what made me think the threesome was... racial.  She says all women fancy it, setting up black male sexuality, and then the outcome of the threesome, while not explicitly emasculating, was cutting.  The scene itself is somewhat hilarious outside race, but in the context of her comments and the fact that the noted appearance of black people in the film is end-capped with buffoonery and bookmarked with a racial and sexual stereotype is suspect.  I'm not saying you cannot have divisive characters in film.  But perhaps Seligman and Joe exist to spout the same viewpoint: they simply divided the dialogue.  Seligman got the analytical persona and Joe got the compulsive persona, but, in the end, over-analysis and compulsion are both ways to somewhat pompously distance yourself from other people and from life itself."
"Maybe it's the formula of every episode, or maybe it's just that the show has gone on too long and has gotten tired -- whatever it is, I just don't enjoy it like I did early on. I do continue to like &#34;Jane&#34; and I hope the actress finds another series where she can display her talents, but the other actors are only so-so. I would have given the first couple of seasons five stars."
I had thought this would be a great story and series to watch. After watching the preview I have no interest in this show.
"I was excited about this series when it first aired. Then season 2 came along, and it was intriguing. But now it's just...silly...and confusing. I think the writers see themselves as sort of William Gibson meets China Mielville or something. I've watched three episodes in season three and think I'll give up. It's just too much work for the entertainment one receives."
"Seasons 1 and 2 were great.  Not sure what went wrong but season 3 seems disjointed and the storyline was flat out boring.  Definitely not worth the money for the season pass.It was so boring that I started to really notice things like how lousy of an actress Rachel Nichols is.  She's constantly (and annoyingly) moving her head left and right when she's speaking and her &#34;crying&#34; is laughable.  And she cries a lot in season 3.  And when she's not crying she just makes that &#34;I just sucked on a lemon&#34; face.  o.OLiber8 is reduced to scene fillers, Carlos just runs around making tough guy faces (or is that constipation) but other than that he doesn't really do anything, and butt kicking Emily is nowhere to be found except for a few seconds of screen time where she just plays &#34;the girlfriend&#34;.Do yourself a favor and skip season 3."
Just not my type of show.
"Boring, slow,  predictable, unsexy, unfunny.  My wife and I didn't laugh once. POOR SCRIPT. Waste of the actor's talent and our time."
"WALK OF SHAME is an aggressively formulaic comedy about a local news reporter named Meghan Miles. When her bid to anchor a national network is rejected, her friends take her out for a night on the town to get her mind off her problems. Unfortunately, after a very drunken one-night-stand, Meghan is informed that the network is willing to give her one more chance. Stranded by boozy circumstances without her purse, phone, or car, Meghan has eight hours to make her way through L.A.'s grimier districts and back to her place of business. This is less a walk of shame than it is a hasty dash with stolen bicycles and the occasional glimpse of meth.The movie isn't what I would call actively bad, but it is also pretty much a predictable comedic installment running through all of the same tired motions with the same stock characters. And, of course, the movie stretches credulity multiple times. Sometimes it's a background thing: Meghan's one night stand is with an impossibly good-looking bartender (Jason Marsden) whose open-plan, exposed-brick studio apartment would cost more than twenty L.A. bartenders could afford in a good month. Mostly, though, the incredulity is stretched at the expense of the movie's main comedic crutch, which is that the mostly demure Meghan has borrowed her slutty friend's sexy yellow dress and now everyone she encounters immediately assumes she's a hooker. Cue: shenanigans as no one helps her.While most comedies like this rely a lot on hilarious misunderstandings, it takes some clever writing to make that misunderstanding seem believable, and here it simply doesn't work. Or at least not consistently. Audiences are left to wonder why she doesn't just speak up for herself while cops and bus drivers are reading her the riot act. You could argue that she's trying to avoid being noticed as a local news anchor (the network that's considering her has made it clear that they want someone with a respectable, family-type image), but really, Meghan's circumstances could be easily explained without salacious details. So, under this overriding conceit, she runs from horny cab drivers, runs through traffic, gets involved in gang shootouts, and becomes something of a news item herself.I considered the film a three-star movie up until the final five or ten minutes, when our conclusion turned into moralizing. I don't know why comedies feel like they have to have some kind of lesson or message in them. Isn't it enough to make people laugh? Anyway, while the movie was mildly amusing in a forgettable way, it took a turn for the worse at the end when Meghan decided to  turn her walk of shame into one of pride, and the scriptwriter decided to shoehorn a weird, clunky sermon about being yourself and judging others. The moment feels forced and preachy and vaguely off-putting. Much in the same way that the people Meghan encounters are constantly chastising her for looking as skinny and tawdry as a meth-addicted hooker, while that -- I'm sure -- is what the producers were hoping would be a big drawing point for audiences. With apologies to Elizabeth Banks, who I think is both beautiful and talented and who does a stand-up job here in spite of the material.Mostly forgettable when it isn't annoyingly pounding the pulpit, this is yet another cookie-cutter comedy from the Hollywood treadmill."
"Where to even begin with this? For starters, I guess I could say that while it is nice that females are getting leads in comedies, it is sad that Elizabeth Banks, quite a talented actress, is saddled with this kind of unfunny crap. There were some funny moments, like the opening credits, but it was all downhill from there. The plot has the thinnest of conceits: a local news anchor loses out on a job offer, and goes partying with her girlfriends. Afterwards, she meets a guy who she goes home with and after waking up, she begins her &#34;walk of shame&#34; to try and get back to her job on time. Having such a thin story acts as a double-edged sword. It means we aren't saddled with a lot of narrative detours, but it also means that there really isn't much time for character development. And once the plot kicks in, it's just a series of comic set-pieces, a few of which work, but most of which don't. Oftentimes, the humor they were going for was too awkward and bordered on creepy. They also gave away a lot of the best jokes in the trailer. At the end they try to make up for all of it by having Elizabeth Banks' character give a speech about how it's wrong to assume a girl is a whore based on what she wears. Still, it wasn't enough to erase 80 minutes of racial stereotypes and misogyny (as well as some momentary gay stereotypes). Overall, this movie was about as clich&eacute; as you can get. It was largely devoid of laughs, which is very bad for a supposed &#34;comedy.&#34; No need to shame yourself by watching this garbage, even for the few laughs it did provide."
"This is a weak comedy that finds itself funny in many scenes while you watch uncomfortably, waiting for real laughs to come.  They rarely, if ever, do.Then it--of course--bores us to oppression with the obligatory love interest subplot.Elizabeth Banks is capable of so much more as a comedic actress.  This movie wasted her talents by refusing to write funny dialogue or intensely uncomfortable scenes, and failing to include any funny side characters for her to bounce off of.Most of the scenes seem like unfinished rehearsals, in which the funny parts have not been discovered or written yet.  But they filmed it all anyway and called it a movie.TERRIBLE."
"Well, Minnie Driver was my main reason for watching this and she was only in it for, like, the blink of an eye. I love smart teen horror movies, but this is not one. The songs are uninspired. Skip it."
Ya this movie started off ok but then slowly declined into a crappy horror movie with some music thrown in. Pretty much the same songs are  just used over and over again throughout the movie and are not clever at all. Acting is ok but nothing special. The killer was kinda cool but even that annoying after awhile. I wouldn't recommend this at all.
"Odd mixture of Glee and slasher film has a few laughs, some decent gore and a lot of musical numbers.  Stage Fright has a fantastic trailer but the movie itself isn't nearly as good.  The problem is that Stage Fright wants to be a horror comedy but it isn't funny enough consistently to work as a comedy and there are too few suspense scenes for it to work as a horror film--the horror elements are pretty much concentrated at the beginning and end of the film and mostly ignored in the middle.  That leaves the singing and dancing.  The songs aren't bad and a couple of the musical sequences are even fairly clever, but the various elements Stage Fright is trying to juggle never really end up meshing all that well.  This might be worth a look if the idea of a slasher comedy with musical numbers appeals to you, but in the end Stage Fright is an ambitious failure."
"To begin, I'm not the biggest ""alien"" fan.  However, I absolutely love the ""found footage"" genre of films and will take a chance on pretty much any I come across.  Let me be clear, the problem with this movie ISN'T in the production, acting, sound, or anything of that nature.  The problem I had with the film was the fact that I just didn't find it all that interesting.  Honestly, I'm not 100% sure what could have been done to remedy this problem?  The entire movie is based on ""found footage"" recorded by the youngest member of the Morris family, Riley (Riley Polanski).  Riley suffers from a form of autism and the video camcorder helps him cope with the world around him.  It's a pretty straight forward ride here.The Morris family is on vacation and decides to take a trip to Brown Mountain in North Carolina.  While camping one night, Riley is awaken by strange lights.  He wakes his brother, Corey (Corey Eid) and sister, Jillian (Jillain Clare) to inspect what he is looking at.  Three lights appear in the sky overhead and quickly shoot out of sight.  This is apparently an ongoing phenomenon that occurs in North Carolina and is simply known as the Brown Mountain Lights.Riley continues to film the vacation and eventually the family gets lost in twisty mountain roads.  When they come upon a tunnel, they discover numerous cars that have been vacated suddenly and are blocking the road ahead.  When their dad, Peter (Peter Holden) gets out to inspect, the 3 guys head inside while Jillian and her mom, Katie (Katherine Sigismund) go for a bathroom break.  While inside the tunnel the 3 come face to face with the problem.From here on out, it's basically footage of Riley and family rushing around and LOTS of super bright, blue lights shining through a variety of objects.  There is around 5 minutes of actual ""alien"" shots and about 1 minute of the ""abduction"".  Just seemed to me that I spent 95% of the movie WAITING for something to happen and when it finally did, it was over.Final Verdict:  PASS!If this review has helped you, please click the ""yes"" button below to let me know.  And be sure to go on my profile and check out my other movie reviews.  Thanks."
"This movie captures a good idea, but does so very poorly.  There are a couple good scenes here but they are largely outweighed by the bad and the very bad.  I give this two disfigured alien thumbs down.This found footage film opens with the following caption: &#34;The following is actual leaked footage from the US Air Force.&#34;  It's cute when obviously untrue stories masquerade as true stories just to add mood or generate buzz.  The Fourth Kind (2009) had people rushing to Google to check stats of people disappearing and FBI investigations in Gnome, Alaska.  They did it well.  Although that was about all they did well.&#34;For centuries, people have been disappearing on and around Brown Mountain, North Carolina.  Locals believe the disappearances are directly linked with sightings of THE BROWN MOUNTAIN LIGHTS.&#34;  News casts, accounts from locals and witnesses, and testimonials from paranormal experts follow.  These segments represent one of few things that were done well in this movie.A family goes on a camping trip in the Brown Mountains.  The parents and kids are somewhat likable, normal people and their trip is filmed by their youngest son.  On their first night, the kids see lights in the sky moving in a way no star possibly could.The acting is far from top notch.  When the father gets them lost and loses his temper his behavior is totally unfounded.  When they run out of gas (which I don't see happening on a family road trip into the mountains) the family tension escalates and the father becomes rage-y, again unconvincingly.  Then again, even if they nailed their lines, the writing wasn't great either.  They come by several abandoned minivans and SUVs&#8230;as if some camping family Rapture had taken them all, leaving their cars and camping gear behind like a scene from The Walking Dead but without the walkers or corpses.We come across all the standard alien invasion film tropes.  Birds becomes disoriented and fly into things creating jump scares, obscured film of extra terrestrial figures in the darkness, lights in the sky, satellite interference, alien mind control telepathy attacks a la Independence Day (1996), aliens examining humans, tractor beams, monstrous alien sounds&#8230;you name it, these filmmakers borrowed it.  Almost none of this is executed well.  But there is one really cool, brief scene in the entire movie when a tractor beam gets someone, cracking and contorting their body while being levitated.The aliens follow the most simple of paradigms.  They're tall, lanky, grey-skinned, big-eyed, four-fingered extra terrestrials that sound, at times, like the Predator (1987) mating with a velociraptor while slitting a pig's throat.  Later we hear them communicate with the bubbly blip sounds from Signs (2002).First-time director Matty Beckerman does a hardly serviceable job delivering an entertaining movie.  The biggest faults are clearly found in the writing (also done by a first-time writer) and acting, especially the loner mountain man the family encounters--worst performance in the movie by far.  There are some pacing issues as well, with some seriously dull lulls between periods of action.  This movie actually goes from okay, to bad as we transition from the first act.  It just seems to get worse and worse and the film wears on.Maybe I'd take a chance at whatever this director does next, but I won't get my hopes up.  At one point in the movie the mother describes Brown Mountain saying &#34;It's like Deliverance, minus the anal rape.&#34;  As far as my enjoyment of this movie goes&#8230;well&#8230; it's like Deliverance, with the anal rape.  There were short segments of this film that were done well, but too much was poorly for me to recommend this to anyone."
"Great.  Another silly movie from a hand held camera.  Wasn't that played out with Blair Witch?  Guess what?  Aliens on the attack in North Carolina.  No, not the aliens that have taken over the NC state legislature.  They're in the mountains.  If you plan on watching this dreck, make it a party game.  Count the number of obvious plot holes.  Here we go kiddies.  A family decides to go camping on the mountain. All this is being shown from the camera of the autistic son. The first night the kids see strange lights in the sky that suddenly take off in multiple directions.  The kids tell the parents, who don't believe them.  The kids don't show them the video. Day 2, the parents go to camp site number 2.  The GPS stops working and the father gets lost and ...you guessed it... they run low on gas. Suddenly they come to a section of road built inside the mountain.  Cars are blocking it and no one is in the cars. Dad, son #1, and the camera kid decide to investigate.  Despite seeing no one in multiple cars, including a cop car, they trudge on through the mountain road expecting, well, what?  Then they see something.  It comes towards them and ... gasp!... it's the alien on the cover.  Everyone runs.  But Dad is &#34;abducted&#34;?  Son #1 gets the family into the car and races to a house they saw along the way.  Queue &#34;Deliverance&#34;.  They run across Jed Clampett.  Not really, but mountain man allows them shelter and guns, while the daughter just freaks out. The aliens attack and one by one ...  well, lets not give away too much of the plot. If you decide to let Amazon abduct your money, make sure you watch the end credits, because... just watch.  It really does seem like this could be a decent movie, but aren't you sick and tired of having to watch jerky film movements that no one in their right mind would film if they were really being chased by ET?  And movies that have no real ending?  If you must watch something like this, I'd suggest the better Area 407 movie.  It's silly too, but it has a satisfying ending."
"The premise isn't bad.  It could have been a good movie, unfortunately it wasn't.  I wish someone would understand that the POV of the camera doesn't have to be the whole movie.  They could do traditional and POV and have it make more sense.  I mean...come on...when you are running for your life you aren't going to be running with the camera eye level.So Daddy gets &#34;taken&#34; and the close knit family seems to deal with it really really well.  I mean, if my dog was &#34;taken&#34; I would be upset and mad and it would be for the whole time....not just the first hour.Then there is the autistic kid.  Um...if they didn't say he was, you would never know.Finally the hillbilly red neck mountain man.  Someone took every stereotype and made a character out of him just to have someone narrate the &#34;situation&#34; that they are in.  Like a good ol' hunter.MY ADVICE...DON'T RENT IT.  Wait for it to come on TV at 2am ."
"It was filmed in the dark , which for me I find almost impossible to watch because you can't see anything . That would eliminate the cost of props or settings perhaps ? Just a thought because thats all I can think about during episode 2 , I'm in the dark . Why are we in the dark ? I set the brightness on my Mac to the brightest setting . This combined with the poorly scripted ,so boring episode makes not even want to finish episode 2 ."
"Following hot on the heels of FOX's runaway success ""Sleepy Hollow"", WGN throws their hat in the ring of prime-time television with a blunt attempt at a more ""adult"" revisiting of New England's spooky lore.Unfortunately, ""Salem"" is historical revisionist drama by the numbers demonstrating a complete cultural and ideological disconnect to the period setting, featuring lurid thrills and a shallow undercurrent of eroticism where viewers are treated to a cast of hygienically challenged men, sexually repressed and typically hot women all set in an anachronistic, neo-Wiccan/Puritan dichotomy.For the record I love the horror genre (look at my review page if you're in doubt), but when it comes to unsympathetic or moronically inaccurate fiction that portrays a historical figure such as Cotton Mather (who graduated from Harvard at the age of 15, was a gifted preacher, theologian, historian and scholar of ancient languages, active in philanthropy ranging from the education of former slaves to pensions for retired clergy, a prolific author whose extant works are still considered examples of classic American literature  and was not known to have attended a single witch trial) as an ignorant and bigoted zealot who spends his days behind a pulpit and his evenings at the local brothel is to me inexcusable and demonstrates more contempt than artistic license.Contempt seems to be a primary motivation behind the writing for this series best exemplified by the central character John Alden (think Hugh Jackman from ""Van Helsing"") who in an impassioned speech at a bloody trial, declares the citizens of Salem to be ""murdering, hypocritical, Puritan bastards"" thus giving modern audiences the opportunity to engage in something C.S. Lewis called chronological snobbery while simultaneously summarizing what little subtext this show possesses.""Salem"": intellectually shallow but heavy on gore and sex.... sounds like a recipe for success.  :o)"
"I loved the book, which is beautifully written and a thoughtful study of food, consumption, and humanity.  The film is stunning in its photography and the music is very eerie.  Sadly, they did not maintain the major plot elements of the book which would have made the film more meaningful and profound.  Or they might have vaguely implied it, but images were not enough. We needed a voiceover or some narrative to give the audience more of an idea of what is going on in the lair."
"You're going to need a lot more than naked Scarlett Johansson to save this film.  Yes, she is naked in so many scenes that I forget how many.  And the nudity actually made sense for each scene.  I think.Still, this movie has no plot--it wanders.  Its end is absolutely horrible.  The film explains nothing.  No characterization, no motivations, no antagonist, no climax--this film is NOT A STORY.  It is a dream-like succession of interesting and sometimes-beautiful cinematography.If you have a hard time with Scottish accents, forget this film.  I could hardly understand 90% of the &#34;dialogue.&#34;  And the men talking don't matter to the plot anyway.  In reality, they were captured by hidden camera and spliced into the film.  Really weird technique that only makes the movie less watchable.Be warned: There is a lot of nudity.  Scarlett is a beautiful, REAL woman.  Her body is like a healthy ideal for women.  But it gets a bit tiring.  Believe it or not.  And the naked men were not my cup of tea.  Walking into traps with erections.  No thanks.While the bulk of this movie is absurd and slow and pointless, the STRANGE visual beauty of the film is to be commended.  Even the naked bodies were lighted (or shadowed) interestingly.  The scenes are all creepy and make even the most mundane parts of our world seem alien.But save it for the art house!  Give us story!  Not a presentation of weird cinema.Why did I even watched till the last scene?  We learn nothing.  Our heroine accomplishes nothing.  In fact, she nearly SAYS nothing.Well, the visual weirdness of the movie is like a slideshow.  You begin to realize that you are NOT watching a movie in the traditional sense.  Instead you are just watching art.  Set in a world in which something alien is kidnapping humans.  I think.Under the Skin makes the book it is based upon seem like the ramblings of an idiot or a drug-addled, paranoid teenager.  I feel bad for the author.  I will not TOUCH that book now.AVOID Under the Skin, unless you want to learn how to make camera shots creepy."
"Live Another Day was promoted as having a different story arc. I had every expectation of liking the new version. With one tie in, from a previous season, I had hoped for change. Jack is Jack. He's eternally loyal and capable of doing the impossible. The problem arose when it became obvious there was no real change. New location. New characters. But same story line.I realize 24 is not remotely plausible in a lot of ways. As a drama, it does have to relate to its viewers in specific ways. I can no longer suspend disbelief. Jack is past the point of hug me jacket and happy meds.If I'm watching another season, it better have something better than a failed promise of new material."
"The 24 series were a really good series, with a lot of action, great lines,and some interesting plots.This new cut to half season is really not interesting.It is a copycut of all the elements that made the original series a successbut given in a boring and predictable way. No real interesting twists really.Of course you must watch it in order to listen to the voice of Jack Bauer once moreand because it is an action series.But do not think that it is anything like the previous 24s"
Over the years it has changed a lot and often I find some of the things said a bit trashy.
"Shannon Beador is so negative and obnoxious I think she has ruined the rest of the season for me. Quote from Shannon &#34;I'm a hopeful and positive person&#34;? Really? Do you hear the horrible things that fly out of your mouth every time you open it? She is so hardcore and cold & ALWAYS angry, how did this woman get cast on the show? Please replace with someone bright & positive like Lizzie! Now she's fun, positive & upbeat!Shannon seems to enjoy ragging on everyone around her and finding an excuse to be miserable at every event!! GO AWAY! You're ruining the show!"
"May be spoilers below.Ok, I saw this show on our menu one day.  I thought it, like the movie was based on real events.  While watching last night, my mom looked it up and it turns out that it is fiction.  I only started because I thought it was real stuff.So, I liked this show.  That is until the point came in which they jumped ahead.  The guy was no longer a cop, his wife is pregnant, the one guy is popular now and the killer has white hair.  It just made us feel like we had missed an entire season.  Then it started to get crazy.  It was all murder.  It almost turned into a comedy.The addition of Key and Peele hurt it as well.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong they are hilarious.  But, I kept thinking I was about to see a comedy set.  Messed up the feeling of the show.  It is like they decided to just add random stuff to the story.The worst part though, the absolute worst part was the final episode.  My god, it made this entire series pointless.  I just sat there and stared at my TV.  I thought, no way this is how they will end this show.  But, they did.  Makes everything one hundred percent pointless.  I do not want to give anything away.  But, if you watch you will more than likely agree with me.  Good show, got stupid, turned ridiculous, ended awfully.My mom, stepfather and I all feel cheated out of the hours we wasted on this show.  There is no point in ever watching it again.  I would have given the first episodes of this a four out of five.  But, from the episode that jumped ahead until the last episode I would give them a 1.  Thus, I give the entire series a 2 out of 5."
"The ignorance of  burnt out producers and writers  who finally after 40 years of doing heavy drugs, find themselves in a world of film , that requires no talent,..like the music industry, for instance.I usually rely on the Imbd when I pick something to watch, but this is a true  disappointment in that rating system.Surely  , this being a based on a true story and all,..either someone is poking fun at the people of Minnesota, or the words, &#34;based on a true story&#34;  is a joke, as well as this trash they call a story.I tried two episodes and honestly don't understand why there has to be the numbnuttery or Black adder crap  mixed in with a real true drama story,..Sadly , the industry being what it is today , this stupidity will carry into a second season, because the critics  are old LSD burnouts themselves.If it is, .....then say what it is, .....but don't say it is and mean something else.Because there is nothing dramatic about this crap,...and crap is exactly what this is,..I will definitely be  requesting a refund for this waste of money,.."
derivative but not in a good way.  Took all the goofy things from the movie ( right down to an Asian with a Minesotan accent ) and just replayed them.  Dumb.
"I really wanted to like it,  but it was boring, more about the father, slow to get to the point and the just ends.  Boring, slow, stumbles when your finally getting into it. Sad. It could have been so good,  yet it dies a slow death"
"Co-produced by Hostel maestro Eli Roth, The Sacrament is the new film by Ti West, an independent director who has earned fans with slow-burning and old-fashioned supernatural genre films, including The House of the Devil.  The plot is set in motion when a fashion photographer is contacted by his estranged sister, a long-term drug user.  Claiming she is rehabilitated, she reveals she is now living abroad in an isolated Christian commune, which she invites him to visit.  With a pair of journalists from the alternative magazine VICE in tow, he travels into the jungle to find her and investigate.  Beyond a fence guarded by men with machine guns, they find a serene, technology-free agricultural community lorded over by &#34;Father,&#34; a charismatic preacher.  Father's disciples argue for peace, love, and freedom from the pace of the modern world, but dangerous secrets lie beneath the surface.There is no point in denying or dancing around this fact:  Father is a super-thinly-fictionalized representation of James &#34;Jim&#34; Jones, the notorious Indiana-born religious leader who, in the late 1970s, led his legion of believers, consisting largely of impoverished African Americans, to Guyana and later forced them to commit suicide rather than contend with outside intrusion.  He also ordered the murder of Leo Ryan, a California politician with a particular interest in investigating cults, and four others at a nearby airfield on the same day.  I knew The Sacrament drew inspiration from Jones and the tragedy he wrought before watching the film, but it made me far more uncomfortable than I expected.  In many respects, the film adheres to the true story beat for beat except Ryan and his colleagues are replaced by the VICE reporters, and the plot is revealed via their cameras (a &#34;found-footage&#34; format).  The dual aims&#8212;to build suspense and tease the audience in the interest of popcorn entertainment while also recreating Jones' enormous crime&#8212;clash against each other rather than coalesce.There is, I admit, admirable craftsmanship and showmanship on display as suspense slowly mounts via nervous sideways glances and other modest indications of the nightmare to come.  West is as ever a master of subtle time-release dread.  However, by the time the images we cannot help but anticipate do come (babies administered poison via a syringe, elderly men and women holding each other as they taste the poisoned juice), they send one's mind to an extreme and haunting place, and it is distasteful to see them blended with footage of co-star Joe Swanberg racing around the jungle playing a game of Paranormal Activity.  In my personal opinion, West's well-honed directorial gifts and the imposing, magnetic performance of Gene Jones as Father are worthy of a certain amount of objective praise, but nothing compensates for the resulting nausea as a grotesque event which resulted in over 900 futile deaths is exploited for empty-headed, sensationalist entertainment.  Other people's mileage will surely vary."
There was a lot of buzz about this movie on horror movie sites.  That it used practical effects and was a return to old school movie making.  But it's slow and just follows the standard isolated and trapped with a creature story.  The effects are minimal and the dubbing is bad.
"Maybe it was the dubbing, but the acting is terrible. The plot is about some scientists who are testing a glacial region that has shifted. They come across a portion of glacier that is red as blood. There are denials, suspicions, and predictable &#34;What was that?&#34; &#34;Who's there?&#34;. Well, you know. Mutations are formed from the organism in the glacier, and then there's the blood and gore. I watched this CD at a friend's house, and I'm relieved I didn't waste my money on the CD or in the theater."
"A group of scientist are studying the recession of a glacier. Global Warming has caused some issues, but it is about to get worse. Janek (Gerhard Liebmann) is the main character. He has been stationed up here for 5 years. When they lose contact with one of their remotes, he investigates only to find the &#34;blood glacier,&#34; a red colored glacier which places a red filter on the camera for a few scenes for no reason other than to scare us. When more samples must be collected, the glacier is gone, but there is a mutant rabid fox running around.40 minutes into the film we are provided with an explanation as a team which includes the prime minister is on its way, lead by Janek's ex-gf Tanja (Edita Malovcic).The action builds slow. The special effects were better on small creatures, but comical on larger ones. The big horror scene shows people uncontrollably screaming as lights flash and a big fake creature head comes through the door. The dialogue was extremely dry. Some might find this entertaining for various reasons, I did not.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
"I know I'm in the lone minority here, but this show used to be funny and cutting edge and hilarious. This season was not what I had hoped for; it was too dark and preachy and felt like NBC's Parenthood - which I'm not a fan of... It's as if someone told Louie, the only way the show could return was to compromise on elements.And I'm going to say it: I don't get the whole thing with Louie's ex wife.... I know it was addressed in interviews back in season 3, and the actress playing his ex wife was so good, blah, blah, blah.. and that's nice, but the problem is that it's not believable, on any level, so it doesn't seem genuine, regardless of the acting. I haven't seen anything this confusing since we saw Michael Jackson's kids, and he always insisted they were his biological children...riiight... I'm all for diversity and relationships, etc..., but let's be real... and I think it's more of this subliminal forced melding we're supposed to be doing in society, and it's kinda creepy, to the point where fiction is blurred to be believed as fact, and damn anyone who questions the reality or inconsistencies; like we're all are supposed to be playing  ""the real world isn't the real world game"". If it were a case where these girls were adopted, fine, that's realistic, but to say they're her ""biological"" kids is an insult to anyone with any intelligence.That said, I liked seeing Ellen Burstyn and Charles Grodin... and there were some comical moments, but for the most part, this season was like a weird bad dream after eating rich food earlier in the evening... I mean, that whole bat to the piano was not the workings of a sane individual; unless this is the point, which is horrible too.. and that whole flashback in Elevator part 4's episode was horrible; the guy who played Louie didn't look anything like Louie. The two episode flashback to Louie's' younger 8th grade years were horrible too..it was like watching a whole different series (Wonder Years lite), and it was another example of how this series is now just a stumble and stab at random stuff in the dark until the 22 or 23 mins runs out and they can quick flash those closing credits to say, ""Ahh, another episode done!"".  I can't believe I bought the season pass for this season (on vudu)."
"Hmm, no words for this one."
"if we are to rewrite World War II with happy, friendly Nazis and their partisan, Jewish friends who escape the death camps we're in for a longer series than this one."
"Starts off with an interesting premise but very quickly gets mired in predictable twists and plot holes. If a character has a choice between calling the police for help and running toward danger, they run to danger.  From the get go a woman confronts and intruder, breaks free and then instead of running out the front door she instead runs past the exit, up the stairs and into a bathroom with no window.  In her own house.  Respect for the hero goes south as he blunders past painfully obvious clues.  Not worth paying for the rental, if you liked Inception and Dreamscape you'll be disappointed with this."
"Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) just had a baby and try to convince themselves that their life is not over and they are not old. When a frat house moves in next door lead by Teddy Sander (Zac Efron), their delusion is challenged as the film breaks down into our couple attempting to sabotage the overly noisy frat house, the one that invented toga parties and beer pong.The humor for the most part was low brow ,crude, and juvenile. It was predictable humor which translates into unfunny. The swearing and drug use was forced and unnatural. This is a me-too crude comedy that failed to stay above the water of a flooded basement.Zac takes his shirt off, a plus for the ladies, but they must sit through Seth showing off his mammoth butt during a sex scene."
"This is specifically about Population 25.  I've loved the Longmire series up to that point.  It's the perfect combination between the old cowboy and the modern world.  The casting and character development are wonderful.  However...  Population 25's depiction of violence was beyond the pale.  It is one thing to see the evidence of brutality; it is another to have to witness it in process.  Up until this point, I would have recommended this show as a family show, but not now.  If this trend continues, I will stop watching it and buying it."
"So how is it that Disney's latest uplifting sports drama, Million Dollar Arm, which is the true story of Major League Baseball's first Indian-born players, somehow is REALLY about how a rich, white sports agent saved them from an unfulfilled life? The stories of Rinku Singh (Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh Patel (Madhur Mittal) are of the underdog variety in every sense of the word, capable of warming the coldest of hearts and making you feel a little bit better about the bloated sport of baseball, all while providing an ethnic twist on a formula Disney has perfected over generations.  But rather than taking the opportunity to go in a somewhat different direction, we're treated to the same old slow-pitch fluff that can be seen coming from a mile away.Ironic that Mad Men star Jon Hamm leads the ensemble as struggling sports agent J.B. Bernstein, because somebody at Disney must have pitched the Hell out of this movie to get him to sign on. Bernstein gambled and left his cushy gig with an established firm to start his own, and now it's not looking like such a smart move. With all of his big money clients gone and their one major prospect bailing, Bernstein takes another huge risk. A moment of late night enlightenment involving a cricket match and Susan Boyle convinces him that the best way to turn things around is holding a reality TV competition in Mumbai. Gather India's best cricket bowlers and somehow turn them into Major League baseball pitchers, and in the process tap into that lucrative South Asian market. Problems solved. It's a ridiculous plan nobody thinks he can pull off, but Bernstein is desperate to maintain his lifestyle of fast cars and faster women. Speaking of women, he's renting out a room to a sexy med student (Lake Bell) who is destined to be a love interest. No two ways about it. It's formulaic claptrap but enjoyable and relatively inoffensive claptrap thanks to Hamm, Bell, and co-star Aasiv Mandvi who give the story some comedic punch early on. Plus, Hamm plays a great unaware douchebag. The only thing he does better is silent torment, and that comes later.Once in India the film simply hits all of the stereotypes like this were batting practice. Bernstein can't stand the heat, can't endure the traffic, and can't eat the food. The one baseball scout he can get to make the trip is a surly old curmudgeon, naturally played by Alan Arkin, who thinks the whole thing is a disaster. That is until he starts hearing some real juice. That's right, hearing it. He doesn't even open his eyes unless he hears a pitch go over 80mph, and they come from strong-armed lads Rinku and Dinesh.  Still untrained in how to pitch like a real baseball player (one uses a weird crane technique like The Karate Kid); Bernstein flies them back to Los Angeles to work with a skeptical pitching guru (Bill Paxton).Screenwriter Tom McCarthy (Win Win, The Station Agent) vacillates from bland inoffensiveness to ethnic awkwardness. Take for instance Bernstein's cartoonishly eager assistant, Amit, played by Bollywood actor Pitobash Tripathy. Apparently he's failed to realize this isn't a Bollywood movie because the level of overacting on his part, while charming at times, is mostly a distraction. Once back home there's little effort to go beyond the fish-out-of-water standard. Rinku and Dinesh eat too much pizza, struggle to learn baseball, marvel at Bernstein's massive home and gawk at his neighbor. We get a few brief moments where the pressure seems to get to them, and in these quiet asides we see that Sharma, who was so good in Ang Lee's Life of Pi, is the real deal as an actor. Performances aren't the problem here. Even Bell makes the most out of a stock role that is way beneath her at this point, and Arkin chews up the grass as we'd expect him to. But it's Hamm who has to carry most of the burden and he does seem to be the many sides of Don Draper most of the time. Bernstein is a manly guy whose masculinity is measured by his success, and when that starts to crumble so does he. Hamm wears the uncertainty and anger Bernstein carries well, and while the film as a whole isn't much he gives a game effort.The problem is that the story is framed to follow Bernstein's quest for success, not Rinku and Dinesh's journey to the big leagues. There's very little actual baseball seen here, yet even less of the two boys acclimating to a place of total excess. The fish-out-of-water aspect is unfortunately played up for laughs (which are few) rather than insight, and basically the whole thing feels very safe and sanitized. Craig Gillespie's direction is bright, sunny, and indistinct, while McCarthy's script lacks his usual nuance. One of McCarthy's greatest traits, seen in literally every one of his films, is the ability to show how strangers can find a common bond and become a family. He tries to do that here but never quite pulls it off.  Million Dollar Arm fits in the tradition of other crowd-pleasing, inspirational sports dramas, and for that reason it will surely have most audiences cheering. For that reason the film is more of a base hit than a total strike out."
"I saw this movie in theaters for two reasons: 1. I'm a huge baseball fan; and 2. I watch Med Men (i.e. the Jon Hamm factor).  Even after 20 or so minutes, when I knew exactly what this movie would be, I still really, really wanted to like it.  Unfortunately, this one is schmaltzy &#34;Disney&#34; through and through.For a basic plot summary, &#34;Million Dollar Arm&#34; tells the story of how sports agent J.B. Bernstein (Hamm) starts a competition called Million Dollar Arm in order to find a major league baseball player from the relatively untapped market of India.  The two athletes he finds, Rinku (Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh (Madhur Mittal), are in for quite a culture shock as they travel to America for the first time and have to essentially learn baseball from scratch.First of, let me be clear in that I'm not attaching a star-ranking to the overall story here.  It is truly a fascinating and inspiring tale for baseball fans and human-interest fans alike.As a movie, though, &#34;Million Dollar Arm&#34; falls far short of being great.  The main problem?  It doesn't have a clear focus, so it tries to do too much and doesn't really nail anything.  This could have been a hard-core baseball fan movie.  It could have been a love story.  It could have been a redemption story.  It could have been a new culture assimilation piece.  Had the filmmakers looked at the story through just one of those three scopes (and just bolstered it with shades of the others), it would really have worked.Unfortunately, director Craig Gillespie (or maybe the Disney producers) tries to cram every single theme possible into one movie.  It really feels like the old &#34;throw the kitchen sink at 'em&#34; method in terms of trying to evoke every possible emotion from the audience.  I realize that this movie is supposed to have a broad, family-based appeal, but but focusing on everything the producers ended up focusing on nothing.The two biggest wastes in this movie?  1. Hamm, a terrific actor who plays as transparent of a character as one can see onscreen; and 2. The fact that hard-core baseball fans like myself will not enjoy the baseball aspects of this movie.  It is made for the family set first and foremost.Thus, though I wanted very badly to enjoy this movie and all the right pieces existed for that to happen, they just didn't come together.  The &#34;Indian culture&#34; angle was interesting, but not nearly as compelling as, say, &#34;Slumdog Millionaire&#34;, and recently baseball-themed movies like &#34;Trouble with the Curve&#34; and &#34;Moneyball&#34; will appeal much more to the die-hards.Take your whole family to this one (it is appropriate to do so), but don't expect to be blown away."
"Maybe I am jaded from Black Sails with its beautiful women being naked and the authentic salty language, also Spartacus etc. I actually found myself fast forwarding through this. I do not think you can have a non cable pirate show, it was quite boring for me to watch. I also like the actor for Black Beard but not as Black Beard. I would of liked to see a larger then life physical specimen here rather then your University History Professor. No black Beard even on his face, just some grey. I love Pirates, and unfortunately just not many well done movies or tv shows, I will give thumbs up for Black Sails, go check that out but thumbs down here. If you must watch this do not pay for it at all unless you are retired and nothing else to do"
"I gave TKOJM for short a try and by not setting the bar to high I wasn't disappointed by what I saw.The movies takes 110 minutes to develop its characters, back story and guide the viewer through the stories evolution.It stars out giving the viewer a glimpse of Jacob's life as a young teen living with his parents at their secluded cabin ( where most of the movie is shot) in the woods. He seems to be somewhat of a normal teen who is displaying typical teen problems with his parents who would much rather play video games than talk of play/work outside.He finds a freshly fallen meteorite while chopping firewood for his dad. I will leave his early days life's story there for obvious reasons and fast forward to the present.A group of five friends rent Jacob's childhood cabin from Bob (the new owner) who has been renovating the cabin and gave the gang a good deal since the renovations haven't been completed yet.The acting and dialogue were pretty good until all HE double LL breaks loose and the acting tanks by the entire cast as well as the dialogue. The direction was decent enough for the most part, but the scenes used to build tension and or add a little fear factor were much to obvious and poorly timed. The lighting and sound really needed some help.The kill scenes showed some promise, but again the timing, dialogue and very poor special effects makeup ruin any chance for creepiness or grossed out gore. Jacob's eyes just don't help to sell him as the monster he is. Bear in mind what Jacob came in contact with as a teen in the woods for the explanation for his eyes and his behavior I guess?There is a fare amount of cursing including the F...word and a few scenes of graphic violence with blood and gore. There wasn't any nudity or any sex scenes in the movie.In closing this movie isn't a total write off as the story did show some creativeness and the acting was decent until the chaos starts. The movie could have easily been shortened by 20 minutes or so and by doing so helped with the VERY long time span between the killings (40 to 45 minute time span) from his teen years to present. If the director would have cut the kill scenes just as the killer was??? instead for using the TERRIBLE special effects makeup/props it would have been much more effective and creepy. 2+ stars."
"What has been a great ensemble series relinquished its dialogue to melodrama, with a script that not even these fine actors could pull off.  Even the editing suffered with clearly blocked shots showing technique rather than the seamless quality this series usually exhibits.  I can't emphasize enough how poorly this episode was written:  implied occurrences were spelled out in aghast expressions, over the top exclamations, declarations of intent, &#34;We won't let her get away with this!&#34;, etc.  It felt like an old episode of Adam12.  Give this people the excellent writing, plotting and personal trajectories we all used to and they will run with it.  In the meantime, this is  the first episode I have watched, ever!, that I could barely watch my way through."
Not that good
"loved the first 2 seasons, last year it introduced the character in this season that i am so not liking. anyone who remembers the series &#34;V&#34;, and the &#34;starchild&#34; will understand how annoying this show has become. Such a shame because the show has been very good up until now and debating on waiting until i comes to Prime so i don't have to waste $1.99 an episode to be disappointed...bummed"
"Well done, to be sure but not something I enjoyed.  Just not to my liking.  I should have known better, just wanted to try it out."
"I'm right there with the Captain...&#34;this is the first time I've seen you since you boarded&#34;...or something to that effect.  I get the feeling that some heavy editing happened before release.  We don't get to see any detail of what those scientists are up to, at least not that I recall. I thought it odd that there was radio silence (except for a select audience of one).  More fiction than science I guess.  I was hoping to get that feeling of urgency that you might have felt in Legend, Outbreak or possibly the Andomeda Strain (the original, not that sad replication for TV).  Pass...for now. I'll wait until it's free on Netflix."
"The first seasons were fun. Always wanted to know what was going to happen.  Now, the plots are less interesting, sometimes it is hard to know what is going on.  I do not care to rewatch on my Kindle to see if I missed something.  I will try watching this week's episode, if it is not more interesting--that will be it!"
"If you want to rent it, go ahead.  There are a few decent things about it:1) About 40 minutes in, the tension actually builds while they're in the tent... but it lasts a little too long and is broken up by them trying to escape... which is commendable - you don't want them running, screaming out of the tent into the night like Blair Witch.  Too iconic.  But, still... it did drag.2) A little man candy, if you're into that.  Although, can I just say, I don't blame her for not marrying him... what a DOUCHE!  It's also hilarious to hear him complaining about LA as if he wasn't quintessentially LA.  Every word out of his mouth was like a bad line read.  At least she could act... sort of.But, yeah... I guess Bigfoot steals white women?  This is the moral of the story."
"I was not expecting too much of this program so I was not overly disappointed.  More fantasy that science fiction, I found it boring and absent of anything that might be intellectually stimulating or even entertaining.  If you like fantasy, you might want to check out one show, but if you are looking for something entertaining that would also hold your interest, I would skip this one."
"This is based on the movie Legion, and I am just not getting it.  The instructions have finally transferred to Alex from Jeep.  Jeep has never learned to read the instructions, and he also hasn't found the prophets.The show has started out slow with Alex, the chosen one, living in Vega (Vegas anyone?  What is up with the stupid name change?) under a feudal type of system.  They have all heard of the Chosen One, but no one was aware that Alex was that person.  And once they learn the identity of the chosen one, they really don't care.  Chosen for what?The show is slow.  Even the actors appear to be slow.  Alex has a love promised to another.  The feudal lords are always trying to figure out how they can become king.  There is treachery.  There is a secret group with one of the children of the ruling families who heads it that is secretly helping Gabriel to defeat humans.  I can't even figure out how that makes sense.  I watched three shows, and I am still waiting for something beyond petty human bickering and angel angst."
"Once in a while, I try out a new cable show.  I had read descriptions of it online, so I knew what to expect.  The show is predictable and a bit boring.  Chosen One stories are so overdone. It's possible that this show was created for the younger set. I'm of the age that I used to watch Star Trek on B&W TV when it first aired. I prefer movies/shows like Stigmata, The Prophecy, earlier episodes of Supernatural, Thor (the first movie ONLY). I cancelled the season pass as soon as I saw the second episode.  Cable free for over a year; still a good decision."
"&#34;Animal&#34; is Chiller TV's latest in SyFy-esque rip-offs, although this one lacks the humor and WTF moments SyFy's do.  I group of teens go for a stroll in the forest and come across an &#34;animal&#34; (similarly looking to the creatures found in &#34;Feast&#34;).  The race for survival is on.  What happens next is why the film just missed its target.  Bad writing dooms this creature feature from the first encounter with the beast.  Every person involved makes every wrong decision you can imagine, but I supposed the filmmakers had to have a reason to get in some carnage.&#34;Animal&#34; isn't a good movie and it's really not that bad of a movie.  The screenplay (or lack thereof) dooms it.  I cannot recommend it, but I'm not going to say stay away either.  Believe me, Chiller TV has come leaps and bounds from its first film, the nasty &#34;Ghoul&#34;.  This version is unrated for violence and language."
"The fight choreography in this program is among the worst I've ever seen. These supposedly agile, strong, ferocious creatures can only stand around and growl menacingly at each other, with an occasional swipe of the claws. Unfortunately, our werewolves swipe a bit worse than the bad guys and usually collapse into a heap with a stern look. Our Asian martial artist will inevitably drop her weapon and collapse as well.Please....I know we have to put our heroes into peril, but can't we put at least some thought into making it intelligent peril and avoid making them look foolish and incompetent?"
"If &#34;Witching & Bitching&#34; was anything like Alex de la Iglesia's last film &#34;The Last Circus,&#34; then its audience would be in store for surreal visuals, an incredible score, and most importantly two hours of unpredictability. Unfortunately, &#34;Witching & Bitching&#34; decides to be much more absurd rather than an intriguing tragedy of horror.The lighting is visually striking as soon as the film begins as Eva (Carolina Bang) rides her motorcycle through a forest during the day. The sun's light leaks through the holes in the branches of trees to create this optically pleasing opening scene. The colors and costumes during the heist sequence are also incredibly vibrant, but it's disappointing that the gore you see here is all you get in the entire film.Jose's ex-wife Silvia (Macarena Gomez) overreacts to an extent that is mind boggling and completely frustrating. Not only is she the worst nurse in existence, but she outruns a couple of cops solely because she realizes her son is part of her husband's heist. Hellacious women and complaining about them in length are the bread and butter of the film, which leads one to believe that Mr. Iglesia has likely had it rough with the opposite sex over the years.The horror-comedy is somewhat compelling at first with a shootout that sees someone dressed as Spongebob shot until their last breath and a car chase in a taxi culminating with one of its passengers being tied up and thrown in the trunk. Around the time Jose and Antonio start drooling over and competing over Eva's affection is where things go downhill. Witches begin crawling on ceilings, male characters make out with each other, and a giant, blind, obese woman with breasts that sag so low that it's a safety hazard for everyone within a three-mile distance stomps into the picture only to begin eating people.&#34;Witching & Bitching&#34; is an overly bizarre film that does fit Alex de la Iglesia's repertoire, but at the same time pushes the boundaries of fun and outrageous which results in a ludicrous atmosphere. &#34;Witching & Bitching&#34; is essentially &#34;The Wicker Man&#34; if Sam Raimi got a hold of the rights and directed it."
"With a dour and uninspiring script, the fabulous acting and the remarkable photography are wasted in this grim look at the future, 10 years &#34;after the collapse.&#34; Post apocalyptic films are quite common, and many of them can be grim, but even in the grimest of films there is someone or something to root for. This films give you virtually no one to identify with. There are the bad guys, the very bad guys, and the even worse guys, with only the occasional transient character who might have some redeeming quality. The film is not enhanced by pseudo-aboriginal music that tantalizes the listener that perhaps some symbolic native magic is in store, but it never comes."
"There have been so many dark, dirty post-apocalyptic thrillers lately it's become hard to tell them all apart. Cue dusty, sun-scorched locale, abandoned cars by the side of the road, guys in shaggy beards and dirty tank tops. And violence. Lots of bloody, ugly violence almost too brutal to fathom. Clich&eacute;s are a fact of life in Hollywood but one would expect David Michod, the director the supremely confident Aussie gangster flick Animal Kingdom, to provide a little something off the beaten path for his follow-up, The Rover. And while he pulls one haunting performance from a familiar face and a solid turn from an unexpected one, the film offers little to separate it from the likes of Mad Max, The Road, or numerous others mining the same ground.Movies set in a future resembling a burned out husk have long been the bastion of indie filmmakers looking to skirt around budgetary issues, and if &#34;burned out husk&#34; is what one is looking for then the south Australian outback requires the minimum of alteration. In short, it's a desolate place, perfect for a story of men frayed at the edges, ruined by a society that crumbled a decade prior. There are still laws, albeit nobody to really enforce them. Money is practically worthless, food at a premium and petrol even more so. Mercenaries stalk the streets, crucified men litter the highways, and basically every encounter could be your last. Familiar or not, Michod paints a terrifying picture of a hopeless world.Guy Pearce, hiding behind a thick beard and far-away eyes, is Eric, a man without a past, certainly without much of a future, and only one possession and that's his car. After stopping by a nearby &#34;bar&#34; for a drink, his car is stolen by three shady types (one is played by Scoot McNairy) clearly on the getaway from something. Eric stalks them down in another vehicle, only to have them get the upper hand and flee, once again in his car. The rest of the film is about this mysterious man's tunnel vision in getting the car back and gaining some measure of revenge on those who took it.First he encounters the simple-minded Rey (Pattinson), who was shot and left for dead by his brother, one of the guys Eric is seeking out. The film relies heavily on the bonding between these two, which has moments of gallows enlightenment as they kill their way to where Eric's car is stashed. &#8220;You should never stop thinking about a life you&#8217;ve taken. That&#8217;s the price you pay for taking it&#34;, Eric says during one of their many roadside conversations. Eric doesn't speak much, hardly at all really, but when he does it's to say things like this. And they would have considerably more meaning if Michod, who co-wrote the script with Joel Edgerton, had a clearer definition for the character. Bodies pile up, mostly for no good reason and largely at Eric's hand, and he doesn't seem the least bit concerned about them. In one memorable moment, he buys a pistol from a little person only to shoot him with it immediately after, basically out of annoyance. At some point the bleak locale has become an excuse to portray excessive levels of violence without having to be concerned about why there is so much bloodshed. Michod offers no real reason for anything, and it's too much to say the film is about nothingness. That's not true. The utterly pretentious &#34;twist&#34; ending tells us Michod wants it to be about something, he just never gets around to letting us in on what it is. A small hint of sentimentality emerges through the harshness and it feels utterly misplaced and unearned. Like Animal Kingdom, Michod specializes in establishing mood, especially the desolation that follows bad people who live a life of doing terrible things.Pearce should be getting more leading roles but he seems to favor show-stopping supporting turns at this point. In a rare starring turn he's especially gruff and haunted. It's not a part that requires much from him yet he delivers what's expected and more. The more interesting performance is by Pattinson who has basically jettisoned Hollywood limelight behind to flex his dramatic muscles with indie directors. So far it hasn't really worked out, and it doesn't really work out here either. With his teeth a mangled mess and his nerves all jittery, Pattinson's portrayal of Rey is too practiced, too aware. What's impressive is Pattinson's dedication to the role and willingness to branch out into something like this in the first place.Animal Kingdom was a confident debut that promised Michod as a bright new filmmaking voice. Too much of that voice has been silenced with The Rover but he should have no problem regaining it next time."
"I am disappointed in the start of the 5th season.  For me and my wife, sex has started to play a prominent role in the program.  Especially when a prostitute is featured as one of the stars.  If this keeps on and the spy angle starts to take a back seat, we will quit watching the series.We do like good mystery programs."
Move along. Nothing to see here.
"Even though the first episode was written by Stephen King, the show kinda got very dorky, very fast.  The way that the writers got the hero out of his predicament (with Junior ready to pull the lever on the hanging) was wack-ola.  And then nobody could kill Big Jim, with all his snarling and threats? And then, the heroine jumps into the lake to save a young girl, but has a still bleeding bullet wound that she just regained consciousness from?  Eek, this is one nutball plot.  Acting seems a bit better, but its just so incredibly DUMB.Never fear,  I'll watch it anyway for laughs on Amazon Prime; at least I don't have to endure the commercials."
And another Stephen King story. That says it all.
"Dragging on, needs to make a move and show life outside the dome. Can't makeup it's mind if it wants  to be a juvenile show or an adult show."
"The first season had an intriguing plot line. Now it just seems silly. Poor acting doesn't make it any better. Big Jim is just a bully, and the others kinda go along."
"Stephen King is better than this, who wrote this drivel?"
"Season 1 was rather mediocre, but still watchable.  Season 2 is just plain dumb.  Nothing is holding my interest any more and I've watched my last episode."
"Did the producer have tough time keeping the old stars under the dome? and decided to keep killing them one by one all in the first episode of season 2 or this is going to be a trend wherein people just keep getting killed and new one emerge from water, air, sky...automagically by the magnetic cosmic mumbo jumbo with no earthly explanation whatsoever. Sort of disappointing so far as we progress into season 2... If this trend continues... I may just decide to blow the dome with sledgehammer and switch to something else that has less killing and more sensible and explainable Sci-Fi under the sky."
They need to wrap this series up this season. Acting is awful.
"For a show with an unbelievable premise to start with, it has somehow managed to become even more absurd. The first season was fun even though it was unrealistic but the first episode of season 2 went &#34;beyond the beyond&#34;. I love Stephen King and I am willing to suspend belief but I have one more episode in me before I may have to jump ship on this."
"This was an interesting show.  A man finds himself in a position he does not want.  I set it on my DVR and am interested to see what happens next.The only problem I see is that fact that this episode has SO many things going on.  I mean, wow, it was hard to keep up with it all.  Not just big things, but little things that you really had to pay attention to.  I felt like I walked into a two and a half hour movie that had already been on for an hour.  But, I will watch it to see if it is worth sticking with.Update:After watching the episode I had recorded last night, I have to change my review from three stars to two stars.  So, three kids were killed.  I have had a feeling for a bit about this show.  I see on the news today that something like this actually just happened.  I just get the feeling that I am watching a show about a family or terrorists.  Maybe it would be interesting, but I just do not think I can really get into it.  Why, would I care anything about these people?  I feel nothing for them.  They are a group of killers and extremists.  Perhaps that is the meaning of the show.  It was created to show you the life of a member of said family, who is not like them.  But, I just can't see myself every really being able to get into the show.  I shall try one more episode though."
I love Paul Rudd and Amy Poehler but the script is not good.I had to cut this movie off.  This is just too wierd for me.
"This was so lame that 1 day after I saw it, and noticed it was still on my watchlist, I had to search my memory to recall what it was about. Once I did, I rolled my eyes. Problem #1: The main protag (female): just lame. Annoyingly lame. #2, the only other character, besides Fahey that was even remotely compelling was the boyfriend. He, like the rest, had little to no character development. #3: no good atmosphere. That sterile chamber was anti-atmospheric. The rest was dark and cavelike but no decent camerawork to accentuate anything except 'dark'. I saw the Aussie flick, Sanctum, not horror but thriller, about an underwater cave explorer who goes out with his team to chart unexplored cave systems (underwater of course). That one was way better than this. And it wasn't even horror. The horror effects here were mainly nanosecond long demonic eyes popping up in ordinary faces. The ending was so obvious to me that I snorted in derision when It came to pass. A total waste of horror. Is this really getting wide distribution?? Then what I said about the other big studio flick ""No Vacancy"" applies here: American horror is dead."
"I truly, truly adored Season 1, but Season 2's just rubbing me the wrong way.  WAY too much blood and ugliness.  I hope it improves and there's more dialogue and sharp writing. It seems kind of cartoonish at present.  The abuse of the little (tweens) boy is particularly disturbing. I don't get who the freaky chick (who played Jason Bourne's girlfriend) is, where she came from or what she's up to.  She apparently killed her own goon in the 2nd episode. I have to check facebook to see if anyone can explain this to me."
"I'm such a huge fan of Halley Berry and SciFi movies and TV programs in general, BUT.  I watched this pilot and like the overall idea, but as the saying goes, '...first impressions mean everything.'  Things I don't like about this already:  1.)  Her husband is a scientist who doesn't believe humans have souls - he insults those who believe so and likens the soul to a 'lifetime of memories' only.  I am uncomfortable with this premise on any level.  2.)  One scene shows the son and husband being shuttled to a science conference by a self propelled/piloted transport vehicle on auto pilot.  I also have issue with this as well as I hope we never succumb to this idea of vehicles as mere appliances to get us from point A to B instead of as a right of passage during our youth and a means of independence and joy.  I enjoy my ICE vehicles and would not trade them in for any EV - EVER!  Since I'm an open minded person, I will continue to give this new series a chance and hopefully the cool and imaginative plot lines will overshadow the writer's agnostic undertones."
"OK...no one will like this review, but that's OK. Everything that has to do with space on TV or in the movies in the US is NASA-backed. NASA has closed down its space-shuttle program and is getting ready to decommission the IST, so they are getting ready for a huge push (in sucking up your tax money) to expand their programs. The mars mission is on the boards. Another digital space station (probably not internationally-sanctioned) is also in the works. These shows are written to make US citizens be PRO-SPACE, which is why a zillion Star Treks were sanctioned; so that you don't mind them stealing billions and trillions of dollars of your tax money, while they let our planet rot in its own filth! This show is Sci-Fi Channel stuff and utilizes the identical forms of propaganda:*pushing outrageously expensive space programs, while the rest of the planet's needs rot in hell!*spiffy technologies--mostly to push this crap on consumers, who need the next tablet!*inter-racial sex and relationships (The JNWO's never-ending mission to dilute/exterminate the white-Christian race)*pushing robotics--this is the next big moneymaker for NWO companies*the Japanese as technological and intellectual leaders of the worldThis showing is merely for analyzing test audiences to see if they will accept this propaganda on a weekly basis."
"Unlikely plot, single lonely astronaut. Looks pretty, makes no sense."
"The show could be interesting, I simply don't like the games CBS is playing with releasing the shows to instant video so I'm taking it off my watch list."
"Two episodes in and still boring.  This is the kind of show in which 70 percent of the scenes are totally unnecessary and completely irrelevant to an otherwise very thin and clich&eacute;d plot.  And the rest of it, the presumed &#34;plot&#34;, is just plain dull. I would rather see a decent storyline with most of the time spent in commercial breaks, rather than a bad show with tons of pointless filler.  What a waste of pixels!  Halle is a talented actor and she looks like she already knows that she is stuck in a lemon -  she looks terribly bored with this fiasco herself.  I see an early cancellation for this one."
"Well, the word sabotage reminds me of the great Beastie Boys song,and it will still do since this is not movie that I am going to remember for a long time.It is not that Schwarzenegger is to difficult to understand with his heavy accent(yes he talks a lot in this movie) it is because this is supposed to be an action movieand it has less action than the trailer.Schwarzenegger has a great team of agents fighting drug lords, with great guns and greatattitudes. They try to rob some money on an operation, and then when you think thatthey are going to fight the whole of latin american cartels, the movie turns out to bea kind of mystery movie about the team's members dying one by one. Boring!!!So apart from some really cool looking guns and a reference (negative) to the Guatemalan Kaibiles special forces, there is nothing interesting in this movie.No, Arnold is not back, and despite the good cast it is not the movie you expect. Mireille Enosstands out a little since she plays the really really crazy lady, but we are used to thatfrom her acting in &#34;The Killing,&#34; where she is not so over the edge, but still she is weird.All in all it is a simple action movie, worth watching it if you like this kind of movies.But don't expect to much!"
"The way the whole airplane issue was handled was idiotic, from the plane staff just standing there while something strong enough to pop bolts tries to  break out of the compartment below, to the twits from the CDC going in and then deciding to go rogue and ignore voice communications, made me want to ask the writers what idiotic drugs were they on when they wrote these scenes. The best is when they people become active again, instead of getting more trained people from the CDC in to help, they call in paramedics? There's containing a potential spread of an unknown biological agent.  and the female rep breaking all the rules by going into a cockpit after being told repeatedly NOT to enter because it should have been secured. Then she ignores her ground unit; making the poor guy frantic for a response? If the CDC handles emergencies like this in reality, then this world is in for a world of hurt. I hope not. And if this was just someone trying to take some artistic license to make it more Hollywood, that person or persons needs to be banned from writing for shows again. The Syfy channel puts out better Saturday night movies. I'd rather watch Sharknado repeatedly then to view this again."
"This one is a real snoozer. Don't believe anything you read or hear, it's awful. I had no idea what the title means. Neither will you."
"This show is plain dumb and not funny. It is sad how much TV comedy has deteriorated. Gone are the days of fantastic shows like Seinfeld, Cheers, Frasier, Everybody loves Raymond, Tool time etc. And they are replaces with shows like this one, with 2 dimensional stupid characters, bad acting and idiotic writing, where sleazy behavior is supposed to be funny. It is not!!!The 3 guys characters all have exactly the personality; all unlikeable, dumb, juvenile, infantile, sleazy and lack any redeeming qualities, and the girl is the same shallow personality in female version.The stories all have the same theme; juvenile pursuits of cheap thrills like one night stands (referred to as ""banging"") or getting quick cash without effort. And to get these thrills these 4 characters and even the father in season 2 are willing to do anything; ""banging"" the other guy's mom, selling alcohol to minors, threatening people with Jihad terror attacks, cheating the welfare system etc.The 4 characters plus the father are supposed to be business partners and friends, but all they ever do is screw each other over. With friends like these, who need enemies?YUK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
maybe i just dont get it...but crude not funny and irritating most of the time....guys that dumb shouldnt be on TV
"It was a disappointment. I gave it a few episodes to get into it, but it didn't get any better."
"Ugh, I can't take it - making the presidents right hand man involved in terrorism ?! The first lady clinically insane.  Then making you think it's the vice pres, then it turns out to be the president himself.  Uhhh, yeah, right. I thought at first at least they didn't do another mole in CTU (which they had done every single stinkin season).......then, turns out they did have someone in there following the 'right hand mans' orders! But he 'thought' he was doing the right thing.  Either way, STOP RECYCLING THE EXACT SAME PLOT LINES.  And they still have everyone respond to anything with ""I understand"".  Choose a different line once in awhile !  I give this 1 star, no idea why this has an average of 4 1/2 stars.  This is by far the worst of the first 5 seasons I've watched. It's more boring daytime soap opera than action/drama like the seasons before this one.  Feel free to skip this season, I wish I had."
Couldn't even finish &#34;Sky City&#34; - it just feels like a sales pitch. Just get to the extreme engineering people.
"My 18 month old grand daughter loves it!  I guess she understands what Blue says when she 'speaks', I sure 'whoof, whoof' don't!!  I just love that she loves it!"
"When I was little, I used to despise watching this program, and I only hate it more now. Every episode, of course, is repetitive (I know it is a nursery schoolers' television cartoon, but there are more educational, entertaining series out there, such as ""Little Bear"" or ""Little Bill"", that can educate children without repeating themselves continuously) and predictable, even for a three-year-old child. When I was a small child, I understood that, whether you answered a fourth wall-breaking cartoon character's questions or not, they were going to find out the answer on their own anyway, and it can grow tedious waiting for every little scene that you knew to expect after viewing previous episodes to be over with so the next boring, repetitive scene can appear and bring you closer to the conclusion of the episode. I know that many little children don't realize that Dora will figure out the answers to her endless supply of obvious questions on her own as soon as the blue arrow clicks on a landmark along the path for her, but I did and hated to watch her. I also thought that the characters were ugly. I mean, Dora did teach me some Spanish, but most of the time she bored me out of my mind."
"I found this dull and unexciting.  The graphics are very 90s ish and the soundtrack is so-so.  She's no Diego that's for sure.  Then again, she's probably in the country legally..."
"What a morose way to end such a fun series. I always said that if they ever began taking this show seriously, it would come to a bad end, and I was right. It's like, we're ending the season with no sense of humor. In fact, we're gonna off the Asgard by letting them commit mass suicide and then we're going to spring a Greek tragedy on poor T'ealc. This show succeeded through its sense of humor (why else watch a show where everyone within three galaxies all speak 21st century English? Duh!). Now it fades into oblivion without any sense of fulfillment. What a shame. Maybe that's why this season is going for $29! I'd rather buy two copies of Season 1! How do I pick zero stars?"
"Example: scientist walks into the bar where there is only 1 patron & the bartender.  That patron, the pilot who shot down the UFO asks the scientist to his table & in his second sentence, he's hitting on her.  Unexplainable given he had just been on the phone with his girl friend begging her not to break up with him.Example: scientist shows credential at the gate to a secure military base holding the UFO.  Guard doesn't have it verified. Really?  Then, scientist doesn't or can't go into the hanger & examine the UFO with the other scientists.  Why doesn't she verify what's she's seeing?Then when she & the pilot go to the hospital, they are admitted without it being verified they can have access.  Hunh?"
"The show is done in the 1990's, but it looks older than that.  I didn't relate to the characters and I don't like to gross alien testing.  I like my invasion stories to have characters I care about and watch them grow."
"I watched this because the Brits usually do a good job with good production values, casting and story lines.  However, in this case it proved a waste of 5 hours. The writers, directors and editors should be ashamed to put their names in the credits.  Important things happen with no apparent reason and the watcher is left scratching his/her head wondering what was the point.  The American general is miscast and not believable.  Lots of clicking of computer keyboards for solutions that never seem to work out. The ending stinks!"
ordinarily I love British comedy but there was really nothing funny that I could find in this sitcom. . .
Did not like this one at all ... the actors lacked passion for the work they were doing ... camera work wasn't that great either.
Very slow moving story...not very enticing...sound quality not great.  We did not finish this movie as it did not hold our interest.  Unusual experience at best.
"It pains me to trash this show on Amazon, because seasons 1,2, and 5 are truly great.  This season feels like a made for basic cable action show that would air every Sunday at 2 AM.  Every plot device, formula, etc., is recycled here from the other seasons, almost to the point where they feel literally cut and pasted."
"This is a first: An unusual number of five star ratings at a rate that surpasses all of this past years Academy Award (Oscars) nominated movies put together (TOTAL). Also, interesting is that the same fanatic slasher types are hacking the heads off of any one who dares give it one star (or less). Depending on date the same reviewers gave the one star reviews a: 0 out of 25; 0 out of 14; 0 out of 13; 0 out of  12, 0 out of 11. I'm just happy they're not all from Salem.The reason: A large number of people are making sure their Kickstarter funding for this movie proves rewarding.The movie: Simplistic dialogue that could only come from a cliche saturated Hollywood high school apprentice writer. Acting so bad the actors could manage only one short emotionless line then pause for the next actor to robotically respond in kind; back and tediously back and forth. Scenes composed of  95% dumbed down dialogue. Other 5% of scenes composed of a superficial attempt to  appear current e.g. tablets, internet video, Samsung product placement phones. Lot of formula characters e.g. dumb act cool cops; surfer dude; party people; lawyer cutouts; etc.Baddd: How bad? I was ff after 10 minutes and checking it every 10 to see if anything changed. Answer - as blandly homogenized as milk.People! For the honest reviewers not financially invested in this movie; if you want to see quality acting, storyline, sets, props and actually have to think, then watch ""The Best Offer"". It may cleanse you of the effects of this film's shallow banality. As far as the ""fanatic-obsessives"" I hope that VM series wasn't a representation of lives (un)productively lived. Let me know."
"Great to see the gang again, sad to see them together in this.  I'm not sure which makes me feel worse, that I watched this or that I paid for it (okay rented).  It started well I'll give it that, but that lasted maybe 5 minutes and then let the shlock begin!  The only thing that could have made it worse would have been having Harry Hamlin show up for a cameo."
"Ok, here's the thing with this show..everyone in it is excellent..I meaneveryone..the story line is fine and the writing good for the set up.I love the parents and always have but the show falls short of evergetting in the least little bit close to what it could be..I don't know whyit's a disappointment but it is..it's got all this gold and for some reasonit's been cast in lead.  Bummer man, because I would really like to watchthese people..and believe me I have tried more than once."
"This show is nonsense.  The people being conned are too stupid to be believed and the main characters aren't much better - really, it's almost painful to watch.  The show gives no credit to its audience.  I only made it through the first long long episode.  Insipid best describes."
"This was at one time a free download. I downloaded it, but never had the chance to watch it. On the 31st, some weird power failure completely disrupted my computer. The unbox player had to be re-downloaded. None of my films or downloads was marked as downloaded, but they began to come back - over 90% of them. The rest I simply re-purchased on unbox - though I had to buy Borat on DVD. When I tried to either re-buy or re-download this episode, I discovered it listed but not for sale. Why? Can anyone at Amazon answer that question - several other episodes are also unavailable. ???? I cannot even seem to delete the useless episode. Que pasa? I give it 1 star because you can't give something no stars - a rating deserved by lots of stuff."
not funny - not silly - just stupid - really a waste of time if you watch this show .
Don't waste your time with season two.  She could be fun if she wasn't so hateful inside.  Not good.  Yuck.
"A soap opera. Stupid script, bad acting, glaring tech flaws. It promises a lot and delivers a lot of boring stupidity."
I only watched one episode. It had too much nudity and sex in it. The story line was good but didn't enjoy the rest.
If your into history you'll love this!!! ***** for all seasons!! It's a must see. Not for younger children!!! I love to see how people lived in the 1700's.
"Yea, this and Romney will ingratiate us with our friends...Yea, this and Romney will ingratiate us with our friends...there is that enough words?Edit: Bad acting - oh my god can't they find an actor that can actually sit a horse? Whenever they get on a horse it reminds me of those cartoons when I was a kid where the character was out of sink - the horse goes down the rider goes up - a jarring tribute to those who were raised in the saddle. I'm sure that the 12 people that did not like my review live in their mother's basement and keep a bottle of liquid silicone and a box of Kleenex next to the remote."
"Season 6 is a slap in the face for those who faithfully followed this series for 5 years.Something happens to screenwriters when they have to write those last 3 episodes -- they stop being creative and want to simply take the money and run.  They write crap.This ending is even worse than The Sopranos ending -- would you believe it?  They should be ashamed of themselves.I bought Season 6 used, at a great price, and I now would feel ripped off if they had given it to me for free.If you liked the previous 5 seasons, and the characters, do not -- I repeat -- do not watch season 6.  They are stealing money from you under false pretenses."
"This was the worst show on tv . A bunch of cardboard characters , wooden acting , stupid cases and vulgar and tasteless jokes . This was totally repulsive garbage and the fact that TNT kept it on seven seasons shows they are a stupid network ."
This was one of the most mind numbing movies I have ever seen. Cary Grant did the best he could with this plot and his costar...don't waste your time or money!
This is nasty pure trash. Humans should not treat others this way. It is thoroughly not enjoyable. please trash it.
"stupid show, stupid plots, some actors made it fun, sort of.who bought this thing for the network?  Are they still employed?"
"Based on all the 5-star reviews, I bought Season 1.  Watched it and holy bejemus was I shocked!  This show is horrible, people!!!!  What the heck show are you watching???  First, the story is way way way over-the-top unbelievable.  Chuck becomes a national security asset and CIA and NSA agents just randomly take up minimum wage jobs near him to, what, protect him?  And why wouldn't the CIA girl, Sarah, take a job INSIDE the Buy More?  Why is she all the way across the parking lot at a stupid hot dog shop where she can't even see him?  You take a job to protect someone you can't see????  And then Chuck just totally randomly ""flashes"" on people and things that he just randomly runs across and that randomly starts each super retarded and super lame random ""adventure""????  The actors (and characters) are horrible across the board, all of them boring, unfunny and uninteresting.  The show is not funny in the least.  I mean Big Bang Theory, yeah, that's a 5-star show--great characters, great actors, funny as heck, witty, solid stories.  Chuck by comparison has none of those things and is truly a bottom-of-the barrel 1-star show."
PLEASE make the stupid laugh tracks STOP! Every other word... ah hahahaha. Unwatchable. Glad I only wasted my money on the first episode.
"TBBT is one of those shows that people do not stop talking about. After hearing all this great stuff, I thought I should jump in! On a day off, I caught a marathon on TBS. I watched about 4 episodes, didn't find them funny, so I decided it wasn't for me. Recently I won a season in my office's white elephant. I thought I would maybe give it another try, because maybe the episodes I saw where just from when the show was in a dry patch. I popped this disk in, I watched all 7 episodes on that disk, and I didn't laugh once. The problem I have with this show, is that it doesn't really make you think, unlike so many other shows out there such as Arrested Development, Parks and Rec, and Community you don't have to think. The jokes are simple and all the jokes are just 'stand-in jokes' and none of the jokes &#34;come out of the charecters.&#34; I know that was kind of hard to understand haha, but the charecters just don't really feel real., How they portray Asperger's is unbelievably off, they portray people with that disease to be self-centered and really not care for anyone. I have a very close family member that has that disease and he is very kind and not as extreme as that character is. If you wanna see a good portrayal of that disease watch Parenthood or Community. and how &#34;geeky&#34; they are. The overwhelmingly loud laugh track ruins the show, and the acting is just awful. I know some of you probably disagree with me, and that's OK. This is just my opinion."
"this is the exact type of garbage which sends tv viewers like me away from the networks in general and nbc in particular away in DROVES.the creators of this show dont seem to know the difference between nerdy and prissy-effeminate. one character looks like a guy in a clown suit and the other is a recycled version of niles crane from frasier.the characers are retarded and this sitcom belongs in 1982 right between hello larry and the facts of life.the most offensive thing is the laughtrack which screams at you from almost the first moment.this show is an absolute insult to the viewer will be taught as an example of what not to do with a sitcom. the idea might have been a cool one if it wasnt written in giant crayons.if they are going for the youth demo with this one, people need to be fired."
"The only ""bang"" in this series for me was the sound of my remote hitting the television screen in disgust. My bad, I bought into all the rave reviews for this abysmal, Erkel-ized comedy.Throw glasses onto Johnny Galecki and it STILL doesn't make him funny. (His casting as the weirdo, brooding idiot on Roseanne I always found strange, too.) Are people finding this ""cute""? ""Smart""? All I can say if I am over 50% similar to you, do yourself a favor and find some quality TV sitcom reruns to scratch your comedy itch. This will having you banging your head against the wall."
"Wow what a terrible show...I had to turn it off and delete it from my tivo before I was half way through it so as not to infect the rest of my tivo with ""unfunny"".It's geeky and awkward but not in an endearing or funny way...just in a bad way.  Bad acting, casting, scripting and on and on."
"The shows selected would stop and go with my system; PC-DSL. LO is the show for me and why you might asked? I once wore a &#34;Badge&#34;, I served with honor and respect and proud to have served."
"The best thing to happen to season 2 was the writer's strike, it put the season out of its misery!  With that the producers decided to cancel the rest of the season and try again next year.The cliffhanger from season 1 was not even delt with until most viewers stopped watching.Oh, this second season was PAINFUL to watch!  My co-workers dropped out after only 4 episodes. I recorded the show so that I could fast forward through, hoping it would get back on track.  It never did, I kept fast forwarding through the entire season.Season 1 was great, never to be equaled by season 2.  Maybe season 3 will be better, if anyone is still watching.  It is sad to see the hottest show of 2006 go down in flames in 2007."
It has a lot of dirty talk and sex scenes but it's not funny. It's like a cheap soft porn. The dialogues are over the top.
"AMC's - what is this? is a no sense or no nothing show ? this is fun? i don't  understand , people do you like this? no more words."
"I get suckered into a lot of lousy shows by the ""hype"" surrounding the show and all the glowing reviews here on Amazon and in the mainstream media.  This show is another one of those ""con"" jobs.  Sorry, folks, but this show is just plain lousy.  It's depressing.  It goes nowhere.  The characters constantly bicker and fight.  Almost all the characters are a-holes, jerky, uninteresting, unlikable, unsympathetic.  In short, this show was torture to watch.  And still believing the hype, I tortured myself more by watching seasons 2 and 3, hoping, praying, the show would somehow get better.  It doesn't.  The premise is good.  It could have been a good show.  But it is just written so poorly--unlikeable protagonists, cliched bad guys, a story that does not evolve--so the promising premise is never developed into anything good.  Even Bryan Cranston (who is a truly outstanding actor) seems bad in this.  His character has two notes, he's either bitter or angry.  The people who should be bitter and angry are the people who get conned into watching this gratingly bad show."
"Season 2 just ends in the middle of the season leaving the viewer with a HBO Soprano's ending.  Purchased a prime membership so the family could have a movie night. Thinking about going to Netflix it is only 1 cent more and has CC for the hearing disabled.  Like many Amazon rebroadcast television seasons are not CC or have a few of the episodes that are CC and  the rest are not in the same series. So if a member of your family can not hear or has trouble hearing Netflix or Hulu might be a better option since Amazon carries little selection for the hearing disabled. Called Amazon customer support about CC their programming :i.e. Jericho , Falling sky, etc., waste of time."
"Jenna Jameson has no looks left and hasn't for years, and can't spell the word ""act"" much less do any of it, and it shows beyond doubt in this movie made for teenage boys. Anything at all to stay in the public's eye up to and including marrying a violent, egotistical drug head, so I guess it is true that birds of a feather stick together.NOTHING worth while in a movie my neighbor started  watching, and we both agreed to shut it off after 5 whole minutes it was so bad..SAVE your time and god knows please don't waste your money."
"the story is ok. only thing bad is all of the dialog. all of it. and the girls. not hot, but good for stripper quality i guess."
"Rented on whim. Wished I hadn't. Expected ""camp"", funny, b-grade SYFY but what I got was just terrible. Nothing good about this piece of crap."
"This movie is in Spanish only and this director & his producer need to be boycotted on any movie they make. False advertising. They have the DVD cover and title in English... but to watch the movie, you either have to read subtitles or closed captioning. It is a sham to use false advertising to sell  to unsuspecting shoppers. They did the same thing with Pans Labrynth.It also would not have been a huge imposition on the director and producer to provide an Alternate English audio option like we do on our English speaking movies. This is the second and last time this director will ever sell any movies to me. I will never buy another of his movies even if every movie he makes from this point on is in English... because he's used up any trust we may have had. So when his career goes in the dumper in the US... don't blame the economy. Blame yourself for deceptive advertising and printing the DVD cover in English. If the cover and title had been in Spanish to begin with, we wouldn't be so irate because we would not have bought it in the first place. I have thousands of movies in my collection but this will be the last time this director ever darkens my viewing.I have nothing against Spanish. In fact I lived in Panama for 2 years.. but I don't want my movies in Spanish and I certainly don't appreciate the deliberately deceptive False English DVD cover and Title to make us think the movie is in English.If any of our US producers or Directors put a Spanish label and Spanish Title on a DVD cover and tried to pass it off to the Spanish speaking countries ... and then only had the movie in English or French... I suspect their consumers would be very angry as well.They wouldn't like it anymore than the Germans would want to watch a movie in Arabic or Chinese.Amazon is also responsible for this deception by allowing it to be marketed in English. If a movie is in Spanish, then the Title should also be in Spanish. And since this is an English website... it should have a huge warning at the top of the page telling English speaking shoppers that this movie is in Spanish only!And as an added note: This director does cheesy, immature camera effects. Near the end, he just goes nuts with his 360 camera rotating around the main character... it seemed like 5 minutes of nothing but spinning. It got so monotonous I had to fast forward just to get away from it. This is something a 16 year old would do shooting a movie in his garage for a school project.And let's not forget that the kid with the sack over his head was a cheap takeoff on Jason from the ""Friday the 13th"" movie series.Avoid this director and producer like the plague!!!"
"Offensive, and I am not easily offended--would be O.K. if not a prime time show.  Main character coarse and vulgar."
Really cheesy with really bad acting. Reminded me of one those terrible B- movies that play late night on cable Tv.
"I give the actors, makeup, & effects 5 stars.  The writers get a zero !!!  Just another completely implausible scenario.  Science fiction is one thing, unbelievable fantasy is another.  The back to life and transformation cards are played way to often in Atlantis, probably why it died on the vine.  Every episode was the same old blah, blah, blah....."
"I bought this season used and the second disc was actually the 2nd disc from season 5, not season 4. So, in other words the wrong disc was in the case. SUCKS!! Plus, the discs skip sometimes. So badly it'll freeze up and you'll have to either fast forward or totally skip the episode. Pissed me off!!! I gave this 2 stars based off of that, not because of the quality of the show."
"I was shocked. Didn`t even finish it.It was mind-blowingly shallow and infantile.Only FOX could ruin something as great as the original PB.Never in TV history have I witnessed a descent like thisfrom excellence with Season One to foolishness in Season Four.Only watch season one and forget they ever made 2,3 & especially 4"
"I am baffled by 30 Rock.  I bought Seasons 1-3 at a second hand DVD & CD store and it has been an utter pain to sit through every single episode of all three seasons.  It's like torture.  I can't believe I wasted my time and suffered through them.  This show just is not funny in the least.  It's hammy, stupid, utterly unrealistic in any possible way, the writing is bad, the acting is horrible.  There are other similar ""loopy and unrealistic"" TV shows, such as Ugly Betty and Scrubs, that work (I love both those shows).  But 30 Rock is just bad.  It doesn't work.  It seems like in every episode they are struggling to make the show funny and the show falls flat on its face every time.  The show's ""stars"" Tina Fey and Tracey Morgan are just not funny at all.  Alec Bladwin is good and kind of funny, but it's almost like you feel bad for him that he's surrounded by such bad actors and given such bad scripts.  And in Season 3 they resort to these super hokey ""guest star"" appearances by people like Steve Martin and Oprah Winfrey that are just super hammy and so painful to watch.  Like I said, I'm just mystified at how bad this show is and how it's lasted so long."
The first series was average with some interest however the second year the characters seem to degrade. The writer seemed to loose his direction and the stories became more unbelievable.
"If you like fake tough guys, moronic story lines and dialogue that could have been written by a chimp, then this is your show."
"I thought the premise of the series was  ridiculous.  These rebels are criminal low lifes whose lives appear to be caught up in a Walter Mitty hero fantasy about being bad boy bikers.  The script throws in glimpses of male bonding, emotional depth, and odd paradoxical integrity, which comes off as absurd given that they're just a bunch of middle aged wannabes caught up in an arrested development of their teens.  If the storyline didn't attempt to be taken seriously, it could have been a good comic satire."
Too much talking with irrelevant dialog. Not my kind of show. Did not see a point to the episode I watched.Will not watch agaian
"Casting for main character all wrong.  Mediocre writing, very off base cop to gang relationship.  It seems as if they cast MR. Rogers to be the bad ass, almost impossable to believer."
Not all that realistic. Loaded with profanity - well of course they are depicting 1%ers. Everyone knows if you ride a Harley your a member of some outlaw gang even if your 70 years old and wear color coordinated nylon riding suits.
This season stinks. It is preachy with no punchline. It seems tired and worn. I enjoy the Denny Crane/Alan Shore relationship but the writing just seems to take that dynamic for granted in season 5. The increased appearances by Melvin Palmer doesn't help either. That character is best in really small doses. Seeing Jerry all the time is a bit annoying as well.All in all... I'd kinda like a refund. Maybe Alan Shore will take my case :-)
"Despite John Thaw's acclaimed qualities as an actor, I find that he was only convincing when he played a character who was very close to himself. So, which ever of his later characters you take, you are really just left with John Thaw. Morse is very much John and, to me, the best part of the show was the views of Oxford University. The plots are incredibly complex which does not really produce a compelling detective story; the viewer, or reader, really needs some chance of being able to solve the riddle. The character of Lewis is equally poor and boredom is never far from my mind. John had a British RADA accent overlaying his boyhood Manchester brogue and it often slips quite badly which is embarrassing."
"Why is it that no comedy show can go a half an hour with out making fun of Jesus or Christians? American Dad started out great but now it seems they will take the road most traveled. All jokes revolve around Christians. This episode was no different. It started out really funny and I almost said ""see you do not need to bash Christians, but I interrupted by the show bashing on Christians. I have quit watching Family Guy and The Simpsons because of this. The only shows that I really like to watch any more on FOX was Futurama and it was canceled and then there was King of the Hill and it is being canceled. Oh well, after I stop watching American Dad I will stop watching FOX altogether. Which is not such a bad thing? Almost all shows on FOX are garbage anyways."
There were actors from the first season that suddenly were not there and actors that were replaced with other actors - Super confusing AND much worse than the first season.
"Season 1 was not a master piece by any means, but it was entertaining enough. I could see why they decided to make a season 2. However, they switched one of the main actors which was really weird. It also appears as they switched the writers as well. The story lines were just terrible, and the actors did not seem to believe in them either. I fast forwarded through each episode."
To easy for others to use and children to get. Got credit and they told me how to block when gaming.
come on people these are for kids...  I don't care that Diego is &#34;suave.&#34;  he needs to do something with his hands other than putting them all over Dora...  Is he in this country legally by the way?  i don't want my 3 yr old exposed to an illegal immigrant or whatever they're calling them these days...  enough.
This is perhaps the worst Batman cartoon of all time.  Whoever put this on TV should be beaten with a sock full of pennies.
"i have contacted amazon at least three times now. the sound in this movie sucks. every fifteen seconds or so, there is a 'break' in the soundtrack, making it impossible to watch."
"Am I missing something here?An entire season on one(1) disc and a running time of 60 minutes.No thanks, especially at $31.89"
"and I find it irksome when a program, which deals with lying, begins it's TV life, as it were, with lies.  Intentional or not, it's sad that most of Hollywood, if not all, portray Jehovah's Witnesses as a bunch of frothing fanatics. This program would be case-in-point.  It seems to me that the 'writers' would and should make, at the very least, an attempt to get facts straight before portraying the beliefs of nearly 8 Million people.  Clearly this wasn't done, shame on them, and since they in fact DID lie to everyone the program looses any credibility it hoped to gain with me and many others."
"Plot: woman is seen with her coworkers, family, and bf while creepy eery music is played. Everything kinda appears in black and white actually . . . although it may be the gray rainy London backdrop. Anyway, she sees a woman driving off that looks like her. She follows her. She has a car accident. More creepy eery music and people.Comments: This movie tries to heighten the suspense and horror aspect of it with cheap things like music and people showing up only to startle someone. But then the gore starts. Not much but some. You get to see a dead man. You get to see dead woman who has been suffocated with a plastic bag and bludgeoned to death. You get to see another woman in a shower brutally murdered by another woman ramming her fist down the first woman's throat and all this blood pouring everywhere. So there is gore and weird music. Pretty much sums this movie up. I think it is an art flick trying to be cute with a simple morale message. But I don't know. They didn't quiet achieve that. Maybe I am giving it too much credit . . . maybe it is just some stupid horror movie. Anyway it is a waste of 1.99 and your time."
"Loser. Expected something better from Whedon. Big fan of Firefly, the best tv series ever. Think he is desperate or strung out on drugs. Don't waste your time and money here."
"I was a fan of Buffy, Angel, and Firefly, so I had high hopes for this.Well, we've got lots of shots of scantily clad young women, no chemistry between characters, no endearing characters, and a story about a kidnapped and abused girl.  Nothing like delving into a parent's worst nightmare with characters we don't care about.  Oh well, that's that."
"Saw this on the 'Tube,pretty boring and usual envrionwhacko conspiracy type plot and bad corporation,good citizen defending the ""wetlands"" and nature.Conservationists ironically can only conserve Nature and nothing else in Human Form,The rights of The plants and animals trump Humans.Shame that Roberts and Denzel both good actors were in it."
Wonderful show if you are an adolescent. If not then find something else to watch. The concept is funny but the show is not.
"An Austrailian import, it is a 'Splash' for tween girls. In comparision, it makes power rangers look like high drama. Don't waist your time or money here."
"Needlessly confusing and characters I didn't care about so the DVD was shredded after the first fifteen minutes. Next time have a better opening, movie creators. That is all.Rotten Tomatoes gave this film a low rating. Maybe you should, too.Based on a roleplaying game of the same name.The budget for this film was a bit over $25M and it made a bit over $2M at the Box Office. The prosecution rests its case.OVERALL GRADE: D minus to D; WHEN WATCHED: April 2012."
"It seems every year Hollywood dumps out a movie that is some combination of zombies, alien invasion, gory violence, gunplay and swordfighting all rolled into one.  For 2008, this was Mutant Chronicles, a movie about an ancient alien device that is re-awakened by WWIII and starts to turn mankind into zombies.  An international crew of soldiers, both guys and gals, are teamed up to destroy, or at least turn of, the alien device.  The movie has nothing special about its plot, dialogue, or even special effects.  All in all, a waste of almost 2 hours."
"I was an elected official of a small, local government. This series &#34;nails&#34; it ! That's why I hate it so much, it's too real. Not fun...very uncomfortable."
"I tried a few episodes.  Nothing that interests me,  Had the feel of the office, but in a worse way.  Maybe I just didn't give it enough time, but I didn't want to waste any more time on it!"
"Like many people, I can have my interest spiked by advertising and such was the case with this show.  The advertising generated sufficient interest to get me to watch the ""pilot"" program, however, having done that, I will not be watching any of the other episodes (despite one review which indicates that the second season ""gets better"").In my opinion, the ""pilot"" should set the scene for what is to come.  It should generate sufficient interest to induce you to watch another episode and another and so on.  As it did not do this for me there is no logic in watching further episodes."
"Very stupid, i just didn't get it, maybe I'm old school and epected something romantic to follow. 2 co-dependant people with issues, hard to grasps!"
This show is weird.  They just get off on blowing things up and crashing vehicles.  Thousands of dollars in every crash are being wasted that could be used for a good purpose.
"Though I have not really seen very many full episodes of this program before, the ones that I have seen have bored me out of my mind. The plots are awfully dull, even though I do enjoy the music a lot of times. The performers are fantastic at singing and I enjoy many of the songs that they have covered, but the plots of the episodes are awfully bland to me. Other people might think differently, but that is just my opinion. I like the singing; just not the series itself."
I don't like this show. I tried it but not worth my time. I know a lot of people love it but its jaunt not my thing.
"This show is a series of melodramatic storylines and overly-pop-styled songs that numb the brains of people matured beyond childhood and the tweens.  These eye-roll-inducing scenes are punctuated by genuinely funny appearances by Jane Lynch.  Her comedy is a raw, edgy, intelligent addition to a show that is basically the demons of American Idol possessing a school.If you are a fan of American Idol, Disney teeny bopper shows, and show tunes, watch this.  If not, run for the hills!Vapid melodrama run amuck with Jane Lynch injected to help you keep your sanity.AVOID."
Cheap video game quality animation even in HD format. The purchase of this series was a waste of money and time!
"I am just not a fan,and think of this along with many other &#34;popular&#34; shows like Sponge Bob as toilet humor tv. Mindless, check. Ridiculously irritating, check. Perfect for the dumb masses, check!"
"I just discovered this little gem. I had been seeing that it was on the USA network for a couple of years now, however, I had not taken the time to watch. Today, I watched 2 episodes from season 2 I would guess and I absolutely loved what I saw. I am a huge fan of this sort of happy ending character driven (though not to deep) type of show. The stories are simple yet realistically believable. There is a certain continuity as well. The two stories that I watched also involved a much older Henry Winkler playing the father. I won't go into details of the story-lines, however, I will say this show is worth the time, if not the money. However, not for the price that is being charged here or by the manufacturer. There are only 12 - 13 episodes to these sets by USA as that is all they do to make a season. It's the same with all of their shows. The shows are great, but the price is ridiculous. That is not to say that I won't purchase the sets, just not at this price. I will wait for a sale or get them used. I refuse to pay more than $10 - $13 with tax and shipping for a season of less than 14 episodes. The good thing is that Amazon and other sources sell not only used copies but have great sales. So, if you can wait, it's well worth your time and investment to own this show.wasitchuRead all my reviews here at Amazon.com, just look for wasitchu."
"Everyone was excited Futurama came back, but when the crew went through the black hole they lost all the wit that kept the show interesting before, and I can't get the crew's corpses out of my head because this is what this season represents to me now, a defiled corpse. Really it's just plain embarrassing to watch now from how stupid and forgettable the entire season is.Like the episode where Leela and Zapp were stuck in the middle of the woods naked, they literally do nothing but sit around naked. When I say Fan, you say Service! FAN, SERVICE! FAN, SERVICE! I guess that's supposed to substitute for jokes now. Anyone else noticing the sheer amount of cartoon nudity stuffed in each episode? It's like they think the reason people love watching the show is to see the characters naked, which is maybe for some of the people who gave this abysmal season 5 stars, but I liked Futurama for the storyline and jokes, which this season is severly lacking in. Instead of story, we get political campaigns!There's also the prop infinity episode which is nothing more than the writers getting on their soapbox and telling everyone what to think about Prop 8. Thanks Futurama, I forgot you were synonymous with political rallies. I mean FFS I'm not watching Milk here, I'm watching Futurama! I don't CARE about the writer's political opinions, especially when they have nothing more to say then their opinion on Prop 8, shut up and get back to being a good show!Oh and my personal favorite episode the season finale which is probably titled 'mutant pride', is an episode where it's literally just Leela with a microphone yelling ""MUTANT PRIDE, MUTANT PRIDE!"". Then the mayor or whoever that's against mutant pride turns out to be a mutant. Wow, real subtle, I could never connect the dots, thanks Futurama. I swear I'll go out and vote for whatever you want me to as long as you shut up with the politics and get back to your good old self.What happened to Futurama, when did it go from space adventure comedy to some soft core porn/gay pride rally? I'm not against Prop 8 or gays, but LEAVE IT OUT OF THE DAMN SHOW BECAUSE I DON'T CARE! Or if you're going to bring it up do it quick and with subtlety and don't center episodes after episodes around it. What was once a well written love letter to old sci-fi shows is now nothing more than a corpse, taped together with Prop 8 bumper stickers and shambling around a strip pole trying to be sexy for it's fans."
"Boring dialog, bad acting, flat characters, and extremely tedious story line don't add up to anything.  I lost interest in the first few minutes, but I kept watching and hoping for something to happen. I was disappointed. It's definitely beneath Dylan McDermott and Kyle Secor's talent.  I'm surprised it lasted 2 seasons."
After watching the first episode I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and watch the second episode.  I made it through about 15 minutes and knew this was not for me.  It seems to be a dark mafia type show.  Some people may enjoy all the &#34;shoot them up&#34; but after watching The Glades and Justified Dar Blue just doesn't measure up.  I would not recommend it.
"I have never watched this, but I know it eats dirt.  How?  Cause I read every  5 and 4 and 3 star review.  Isn't it sad how we are manipulated?  Ok.  Say it is given 5 stars and you get all excited and and watch 2 hours and realize its a dog.  Who gains?? Does Amazon pay something each time anyone watches anyepisode?  mmmmm?  I really don't know but I suspect and so should you."
"It couldn't keep my kids ages 3-14 entertained, it was a waste of time.  watched different apposed and it was the same.  it's not like the old one"
"Seeing as SpongeBob SquarePants has still remained so overwhelmingly popular after all of these years, I know I may receive a few negative votes from customers for my negative critique. But, before you press that unhelpful voting button (which, please, don't do until you have read my entire review) I just want to let you know that I am not criticizing the whole series. At the beginning of its lengthy run, it was so phenomenally hysterical and witty that episodes were bound to generate at least a few chuckles from you, and the very best ones would leave you wishing that you had thought of some of the jokes featured in the episodes. Sadly, that spectacular quality has declined.In more recent years, the program has underwent a deterioration in quality (I sincerely apologize to the makers of SpongeBob SquarePants). The negative qualities of a majority of the main characters have been enhanced (stupidity, greed) as pointed out by many other people, and the episodes and specials have a ""rushed"" feel to them. They defy the boundaries and limits set by the older seasons (which, albeit they may not bother many other people, enhanced the comedy of the program and became traditional jokes for the series) and the humor has grown more grotesque and stupid. The characters are all now more annoying in an attempt to make them appear funny, and I know lots of people have noticed the same changes and also can agree that the cartoon has lost a lot of its heart. If you want to watch SpongeBob SquarePants episodes, watch the earliest seasons if you want to be truly entertained. I genuinely apologize to anyone who may have been offended, but it's just the way I feel. I'm very sorry and hope I did not insult anyone."
I hate it and I think its a horrible show. Makes me want to hurt the writers and the creators.
"I don't know why this movie was made. If you are expecting some funny Robin Williams bits, FORGET IT. The movie deals with teen suicide. The victim is Robin's son. Robin is a father with zero parenting skills. While the son is a suicide victim, when you see how obnoxious he is, you would hope he becomes a murder victim. What a terrible waste of film. Don't bother watching this one."
"Why did they make this movie?  It's vulgar and not funny.  The story is sickening and pointless.  Promoting this movie as ""Hilarious"" is disgusting and highly deceptive.  Avoid like a plague."
(1.) Dumb; not a comedy no matter how bombastically distorted the characters were.(2.) No lesson or message to be learned in these absurd caricatures.(3.) Only the genetic abnormalities found in the world of Hollywood and it's hanger-oners would find the perversions of romance a fascinating story.
It amazes me that such an amazing actor can star in such crap sometimes. This and the one where he works in the photo shop....crap!!!
"Robin Williams is good in this role, and it's not the first time he has balanced a bit of humor with a serious subject.  But, since I can't give it 0 stars, I give it what it deserves, because even though there is a laugh or two, in reality it is a HEAVY drama with tragic story lines.  So don't watch this expecting laughs like I did, and maybe you won't be disappointed.  It is extremely depressing, and if I had watched this while depressed, this movie would have made it much worse.And, by the way, to the reviewer who said not to leave negative feedback because the movie doesn't live up to expectations, I say this:  It is described as a COMEDY.  Not dark humor.  Not black comedy.  Not even ""intelligent humor"" as another reviewer said.  If I had known this movie was going to be so dark and depressing, with ONLY a laugh or two, I wouldn't have been expecting one of Robin Williams' comedies.  I'm fully aware of his amazing ability to do comedy as well as drama, but I don't like to see a ""comedy"" movie about suicide, accidental or otherwise. (and BTW who knows for SURE it was accidental anyway???)  There is NOTHING funny about suicide. Chances are pretty good that I would have passed it by had I known it was so dark.  And that may just be the point, right??? Make people think they are getting one of Robin Williams' comedies, which are gems, and are MUCH harder to act than the dramas."
"Robin Williams is one of the funniest men to ever star on the silver-screen, but occasionally he does a weird dark comedy, that's very hit or miss. In World's Greatest Dad, Williams plays an English Teacher, who covers up his son's bizarre and embarrassing death. The suicide note he forged gets printed by the school newspaper, making his loser son, an overnight sensation. Williams is a great actor and gives credence to even a bad film like this, but even he can't save this one. The story is just ridiculous, his son (Daryl Sabara) was a complete nightmare that everyone wanted dead. No one would all of a sudden care, just because he wrote a heartfelt suicide note. It's also extremely unrealistic, since his son was as stupid as they come. That being said, with the exception of newcomer, Eric Martin, the rest of the supporting cast was awful, making the film that much more unrealistic. World's Greatest Dad may have landed it's star, but it's a sloppy movie, that really doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It's an hour and a half of pure torture, with the occasional funny scene that's all Robin Williams. This is one film that just starts out slow, never gets going and is anything but the ""hilarious"", ""wonderful"" film that I was expecting."
"I rated the movie a one.  I love Bobcat and Williams is an excellent actor.  But, I saw no value in the movie except for maybe the last minute and a half. It is not a dark comedy, I adore dark comedy.  I rented the movie ""This must be the Place"" and that was a good movie with dark comedy.  There was also plenty of depth.  This movie was about the human condition.  Exaggerated maybe, but rotten kids are sometimes just a fact of reality. The actions of the father were pretty much unforgiveable so he was just as horrible in his own way.  People can read what they want to into the movie to justify recommending it, but there was really nothing beneath the surface and there was nothing worth laughing at; even in sarcasm.  As a matter of fact, they were two people I'd rather not know, and that includes the hour plus minutes I spent staring at them via the computer monitor."
"I spent the whole time waiting for a point. There was none.  Some of the acting was okay, but ultimately something was lacking.  It just didn't make much sense and was not interesting.  The whole concept had potential, so it was disappointing that it didn't deliver. It dragged on so much that I had the feeling that the story could have been better told in half an hour rather than an hour and a half.  I'm glad it was free to watch."
They should have released this as a animated movie and not a motion comic.  The story deserves that. I bought thinking it was a movie I had missed.
"99 cents for 10 minutes or less, interesting concept ""what if superman's ship had landed in Russia and he grew up under that type of totalitarian regime"" -- but you only get a few minutes of story and the rest in screen credits, not worth 99 cents"
episodes are only $1 but its pretty slow kinda hard to watch...and for being only like 10mins it def is not worth it at all
"After watching this soapy, relationship-entangled space opera for five endless hours, I happened to glance at my watch to notice that only five minutes had passed.Award yourself the ""Purple Heart For Patience"" if (like myself) you somehow manage to stick with this turkey to its distant, disapopinting conclusion, for the purpose of finally discovering the nature of its...""UNIMAGINABLE MYSTERY,"" which the creators of the series -- from one grueling episode to another -- keep dangling enticingly before you.Perhaps the one and only redeeming feature about DEFYING GRAVITY is the immense sense of gratification and relief -- and ""lightness"" -- you're likely to experience after recommending it to (i.e., inflicting it on) your worst enemy."
Same plot over and over again.  My husband watches it but it seems very boring to me.  Needs more plot variety.
"Boring, boring and boring. The script look like a recreation of a classic  mexican movie but is not. This  movie is worst."
Even a bad movie can be good but this isn't even bad good.  Not worth the bother no redeeming cheesiness.
"This show is terrible, shoddy acting, unbelievable storylines, the montages with awful cover songs, etc etc.1. The supposed ""good guys"" are gun brokers to gangs and murderers in their own right, I could care less about them. That's one of the main things that makes a series good is that you actually care about the characters but these guys are such scumbags all around it's actually painful to watch. I'm glad they lost overall at the end of this season. I was hoping for a better second season but this was worse than the first one and that's saying a lot. I won't be wasting time on this series anymore. Glad I only borrowed it.2. It's a sad thing to see the cops in the back pockets of these gangsters. It's embarrassing to see the Chief of Police following them around and even taking part in their crimes, a little todie. He even rats out his own ""brothers"" the FBI and ATF to this gang, endangering not just the informers lives but the lives of fellow law enforcement officers, awful. This is supposedly to protect some town from the real world? As long as they kill outside of city limits its OK with the police? I'd be afraid to live in a town like this, who knows what's next with the corrupt police and this biker gang. The cops even look the other way when someone is about to be killed? Even if Sobel is a bad guy what self respecting police officer would do that? The process of the law is one thing among others that makes us a society but this show seems to think it's all OK if one set of bad guys kills another or you're ""protecting"" a town, ugh! Murder is wrong no matter who does it and who it is done to.3. The constant song montages are so cheesy and overdone, ugh!! The covers are awful as well. Just a filler so everybody can LOOK so deep in emotion and to be pitied, etc. Weak minded people love this stuff.4. Trying to make criminals into family men and righteous vigilantes etc is so terrible. I was sickened by all the hugs and love yous between criminal killers I wanted to gag! This show is so embarrassing to watch. I'm just sorry I gave this POS another seasons worth of my time.5. A doctor turns into a helper for a criminal gang and even assaults and threatens hospital staff when she's reprimanded for it? Please. She needs to take that stick out of her a.. as well I've never seen a character so constipated before!The shallowness of it is so obvious, the characters are wooden(Clay) or miscast(Jacks). Genna, mother Sons, is such a lowlife it's another layer of BS that makes me dislike this show so much.If you want a realistic and well done drama you need to go to the premium channels. Boardwalk Empire, Game of Thrones, etc. For a decent but not great regular cable drama I like Justified. But this is just tripe.It's sad to see so many weak minded lovers of this tripe, good maybe it keeps you busy watching the tube so you don't do more damage to society by your idiocy."
"I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS SHOW IT'S SO UPROARIOUSLY GUT-BUSTINGLY KNEE-SLAPPINGLY GOOD! I ALSO LOVE DAVE 'N BUSTERS, THEIR FOOD IS SO GOOD I LOVE THE STEAK ESPECIALLY FROM DAVE AND BUSTERS; DAVE AND BUSTERS IS GREAT LIKE THIS SHOW! I ALWAYS ORDER THE COORS LIGHT FROM DAVE 'N BUSTERS, IT TASTES SO REFRESHING DOWN MY THROAT AFTER I ORDER A DELICIOUS STEAK FROM DAVE 'N BUSTERS! I'M NOT SURE WHY BUT EVERYTIME I WATCH SEASON 5 OF IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT HOW DELICIOUS DAVE 'N BUSTERS IS AS WELL AS COORS LIGHT!BTW GO TO DAVE 'N BUSTERS AND ORDER THE STEAK AND A COORS LIGHT, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"
"started watching this and just didn't feel like finishing. What could have been an interesting storyline was very disjointed, jumping back and forth in time, pretty graphic sex scences that don't add anything to the story..."
"I guess if you like suffering and in dept turmoil you might like this movie. I thought it was very simplistic and shallow. How others thought it was deep is beyond me. I might have missed something, but from what I saw it wasn't well scripted or thought out. More action and explicit explanations might have helped. I know these things happen it's just the movie wants to wallow in the morass of confusion instead of anything deeper."
"I read some of the other reviews before watching this and although they warned about the later parts of the series, I found even the beginning unclear and poorly developed.  We watched the first episode only and couldn't be bothered to follow up any further.  It simply was not entertaining and that is all we wanted it to be."
Not sure what is the point of putting things like this on the internet. Spend your time staring into the sun. You will have find it more fulfilling.
"Sorry, I like ""Californication"", but something happened in this season, the whole thing was a like a bad parody of itself.  Where it's possible it might have been able to suspend one's disbelief about this show before ... it is not possible any more, you just have to watch this season and try to enjoy it for the cartoon it is.Speaking of cartoons .... I bought this factory sealed and new from Amazon, and the video is absolutely horrible.  I thought I was watching this series on You-Tube ... back a few years.  The resolution was terrible and the pixelation was unendurable.  I checked the disks and they looked fine physically, so  this must have been a mastering job done by a complete incompetent.  Can anyone else comment on this ... I just really could not believe a brand new DVD set just out this year could be done so poorly.If you have to see this I don't know what to tell you, all I can do is relate my experience.  Very sorry I spent the money."
"If they take out the swearing and sex, there would be no show - thin, thin story line. I would not watch another episode for FREE!"
A guy shows up on the first episode in the nude joking about his dongle.  I'll pass.  I don't need this crap entertainment.
"It's not you, it's me...The first two seasons were intriguing and a curiosity but as of season three, I am over it."
"I have very mixed emotions over this latest entry into the long-running and much-beloved Stargate franchise. I fondly remember seeing the original movie at the theater and was immediately impressed by its imagination. As it evolved into a weekly series I watched as my sons grew and became enthralled in the story line with me. And yes, we even liked ""Atlantis"".The Syfy channel promoted this show as an ""edgier"" Stargate. I found that this did not work for me. The very elements that made the original movie and following 15 seasons so enjoyable was now totally lost in this self-inflicted reinvention. Stories that were once fun, adventurous, full of camaraderie & humor were now jettisoned in favor of a grittier, darker, gloomier, smuttier and meandering approach.Some shows can evolve successfully. What we had here was the results of a very bad miss-calculation by MGM Television in canceling ""Atlantis"". And then upon realizing their mistake the panic-ridden response to rectify this error by delivering back unto us a forced-format that was now supposed to be better because now it was ""edgier"".""Edgy"" can be a dangerous creative mixture with a show like Stargate. ""Edgy"" can mean daring, provocative, and/or avant-garde. But the nasty flip-side is that it can just as quickly turn into something unusual and unpleasant. And much of this ""Universe"" seemed forced and uncomfortable.Example: One early entry went something like this. ""OK, we have a room on board the Destiny that we are only now able to open and explore""... ""Oh look, its one of those Ancient's Chairs, I wonder where this will lead?"" We quickly find that it leads to an hour with an angry lesbian, a fist fight over infidelity, and ""Oh snot, my girlfriend is a stripper"".As the second-season cancellation decisively proved, this new and ""improved"" model was not the way to have gone. Yes, this was not ""your grandfather's Stargate"" but as it turned out it wasn't my teenage sons Stargate either. Those of us who wanted ""edgy"" adult science fiction got it from ""Battlestar Galactica"". Sometimes it is possible to ""break the mold"" and I feel this is exactly what MGM accomplished by hastily forcing this blend of science fiction together.And that's a shame. First off, because the 15 seasons of Stargate SG-1/Atlantis were unique, interesting and fun. It should never have ended so suddenly. Lastly, the second season of ""Universe"" seemed to start finding itself and showed some promise. It was just unfortunate that it couldn't survive the errors of the first season.I would have even accepted a couple stand-alone movies like ""Ark of the Truth"" and ""Continuum"" to have dealt with the season two cliff-hanger properly winding the show up. Though promised, I fear we will never see these. In a dorky way it would be cool to find a 10th Chevron that dialed the show back onto the airwaves.Note: You are right if you noticed that I did buy a copy of this DVD by ""Amazon's Verified Purchase"" notation. I confess. I love the Stargate franchise so much, and even though these two seasons are woefully inferior, there were cameos that forever connect it and therefore makes it necessary to have in the collection. I just waited till Amazon had a crazy sale to buy them."
"This series has none of the draw of the two previous, mostly because the characters have absolutely no depth, nor does there seem much of a chance that any will be developed. There's simply nothing to connect with. There's not a single figure who is likeable, funny, worthy of loathing...nothing. I gave it five episodes, and that's it. Too bad; ""Stargate"" and ""Stargate Atlantis"" ranks as two of my favorite TV shows of all time. This stunk."
I really enjoyed the various incarnations of Stargate-until SGU.  I hate to say it but SGU is just plain boring.  The plots are sadly lacking and there is just no chemistry.  The actors do a good job with what they have to work with but it is just not enough.  I watched eight episodes hoping it would get interesting before I gave up.  I wouldn't buy this series in any form no matter how cheap they offered it.
Don't waste your time on this series.  It's like watching one of the stupid daytime soap operas that never go anywhere.
Too much attention placed two male type major characters. I sick of them by the end of the season. Needed more plits
"This outta be the typical review the lovers of this show are probably used to by now... surely enough, I love the movie, SG-1 & Atlantis... but cannot stand this one.Why? Well, I can't put enough emphasis on the word BORING. It sums up most of the shows. The first episode looked promising. The SGC had discovered that dialing a 9th symbol on the Stargate could possibly take them somewhere even further than the Pegasus galaxy. There is a very large team from Earth on another planet at the far reaches of two galaxies, attempting to discover what dialing the 9th symbol leads to? Out of nowhere the planet they are on comes under attack all of a sudden by aliens, and whomever was not beamed up by Scotty had to make a run for it through the gate to the mystery of where the 9th symbol leads to.Upon escaping through the gate, they find themselves on an unmanned alien space ship that is losing power and falling apart. From then on the first couple of episodes are up and down, sometimes they have interesting things going on, but for the most part it is a lot of boring dialog between characters I, and I know many other viewers too, just could not find likable.There is a stubborn scientist, a dork who beat a computer game and was asked to join the group to lend his expertise in being attempt at a non military or scientific perspective, a young girl who is irritating, boring, not in anyway any sort of eye candy, and certainly not a strong female role model like SG1 and Atlantis provided plenty of. The only thing noteworthy of her is her father eats peaces of BLEEP for breakfast. Being that she looks 16, no normal hot blooded male over 18 is going to be watching her for other reasons than acting either... so it's a losing situation either way. Not to mention, she seems to be a BLEEP (rhymes with bore) and the crush the dork has on her is more annoying than anything, because I just don't care if they end up together or not when he's focusing on her during every waking moment he's not being told to hack into the alien ships computer and do something life saving... like unblocking the toilets.Many other characters are just as bad. In fact, no one is good at all. A blonde bimbo always doubting her medical abilities, Chun Li still trying to keep everything political by worrying about paper work rather than except the fact she is a million miles away from home and may never return, the colonel who is always being praised for how good he is supposed to be by his men, who always seem to be on the edge of insanity or blubbering like babies, which the colonel does himself when he's not saying pointless dialog or switching bodies with Richie Valan's and porking his missus. We had such great colonels in SG1 and Atlantis, O'Neil, Carter, Sheppard etc... and now we get a guy who looks as threatening as Carrot Top flicking cotton balls at you. I would even take the last two seasons of Stargate SG1's team over everyone in this show!The rest of the cast pretty much mostly seem to be day players/extras and stand ins just to make it seem like there is plenty of more opportunities for more characters to come in later in the series, but i'm at the end of the first series now, and overall I think I have been entertained by about 15 minutes in total during the whole running of the season. So I just don't care if anyone new comes in for season 2. It blew it's chance by becoming a soap opera rather than everything we came to love about SG1 and Atlantis.I'm not sure it even comes down to bad writing, I think it's the boring cast and how the whole thing is being preformed. The biggest thing that's making it boring is the humor... or should I say, the lack of humor. This show has little to none at all. It's mostly dark hallways and pointless dialog about their personal issues with each other or whether Eli or Rush should be the ones fiddling with alien computer programs to try and activate this and that thing to re-route power to shields, weapons or  a device that can give the annoying chick a new brain. (it happens, sigh). The rest is tedious dialogs of complaining, winging and arguments between them, taking most of the focus off of any sci-fi elements... it clearly stands out this season did not have a big enough budget to design better sets, aliens, or interesting new technologies. There was something for everyone, old and young, sci fi fan or not in SG-1 and Atlantis, this SGU version, it's the worst idea for Days of Our Lives in Space that could have ever been conceived.Excitement is too far and in between. Even when guys like Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks and Amanda Tapping make guest appearances, it just does not make the show better. Everything about it is wrong. It's not just the lack of humor, or adjusting to new cast members, it's the entire atmosphere of the show. With SG-1 and Atlantis, you never knew what was going to happen in the next episode... but watching SG-U, you know what's going to keep happening, and the new things that do happen, all I can say is zzzzzzzzzzzzzz... it was like reliving the end days of WCW Nitro. Repetitive, boring and no imagination. You know from the first few episodes it's always going to be Eluid hacking this, Rush's new theory on that, whats her name boring you to death with how pointless she is, moring interactions and dull emotions by the rest, and a sleazy scene thrown in now and then to try and attract 13 year olds whose mom's put net nanny on their computers.I really can't say it enough about how boring I found the majority of this show to be. Nothing at all worked. I still hold hopes that a Stargate finale movie or season will get financed to wrap everything in SG-1 and Atlantis up. The word about the script that was written to do so mentioned it tied together and wrapped up all 3 Stargate shows... quite frankly, if it does get made, I couldn't care less if SG-U has anything to do with it, as it is the black sheep of the Stargate Universe, the actual universe, not the show with that name.And another thing... the music and soundtrack. The film, SG-1 and Atlantis had amazing scores, full orchestras that provided music that even if you didn't pay much attention to it, it never interfered with the scenes, it built up intensity, set the moods for action, or made you feel emotional when it needed to be... yet this SG-U show seems to have none of that. Not even a decent title sequence theme. It copies the dumb formula from Grey's Anatomy and inserts some stupid, depressing song, and plays it in it's entirety... what where they thinking when they through that would be a good idea? And the so called ""creative"" and edgy soundtrack turned out to be nothing more than irritating noises. One particular episodes music was actually giving me such a headache I ejected the DVD and threw it across the room, never wanting to hear ten minutes of what sounded like a spanner being smashed into a pipe every 7 seconds with a god awful dull slow humming noise... whoever recorded that should be expelled from ever creating music for TV/Movies ever again.There is so much more I could point out on what I hated about this show, but if this information I've mentioned already doesn't convince you this show sucks, or you can understand why I'm far from being alone on hating this show, then nothing will."
"I should just keep my mouth shut.  But could not tolerate this show at all.  Lame.  They just recycled the Stargate saga, but out came trash.  I love the Stargate stuff, but this was just lame lame lame."
"BOO FOR PBS. I was very disappointed that only three episodes were free for Prime Members and the remaining were for purchase. American Experience was a broadcast from Public Television which the U.S. Taxpayers support, whether they like it or not, from their taxes. To have PBS peddling this program for their monetary gain is appalling to me. This program can rot on the shelf before I would consider looking at it again."
"As I wrote in my review of season one, season two was going to make or break Sanctuary. And it broke.Only watched the DVD set, so perhaps if I had spaced it out a bit, it might not have been so bad. Ms Tapping's acting ability failed to come to work with her, effects didn't improve (in some cases were worse), the werewolf guy is still a miscast (it shows more in this season). And just before I started writing this, I see there's a season three!?! Poor sci-fi/fantasy fans. There's so little really good stuff to watch, that some of us will take anything.No more Sanctuary for me. Ever. No surprise amazon has season two ""on sale""."
Tosh.0 is not for me.  I find his humor pedantic and crass.  I know many people enjoy this show.  So if you like your humor on the bawdy side maybe this one is for you.
"This show had so much promise.  Sure some of the characters were dreadful in dialogue.  Yes, you could tell things were off to a slow start.  But when the V first hit Earth it's all very exciting.  Then the show was thrown into a pile of trash, and is generally not worth watching.  I recommend watching the series until the V introduce themselves on the giant undership screens, then hit your foot with a hammer, and save yourself the time of watching anything further."
"I wanted to like this show, but it was just so incredibly bad.  The story is poorly executed in the very crucial sense that there's very little true drama, no intensity, no suspense, no humor, no heart, very little action.  In short, the story lacks the absolute critical elements (or ingredients) that go into good story-telling and consequently the show was not entertaining.  The only real story seemed to be the supposedly-friendly-acting-but-really-sinister aliens (aka the Visitors or the Vees) have some super secret evil plan that a handful of humans and ""truly friendly"" aliens are trying to reveal and stop.  That single lone storyline takes up the entire season and it flimsily and boringly drags on and on and on for the entire first season with a few vapid sub-stories thrown in.  So the season was really boring since the story never seemed to progress, mature or truly go anywhere.  Watching it was frustrating.  And making matters worse is the fact that all the characters are boring and uninteresting--the FBI agent, the Priest, the hammy over-the-top Mercenary-type, the friendly ""black guy"" alien--are all boring.  The writing is so weak on this show.  The acting is bad.  The SFX are bad--I've never seen worse green screen SFX shots on any TV show.  For a truly good SCI-FI TV re-make, check out the re-do/re-make of ""Battlestar Galactica"" (Seasons 1-3).  That was an excellent re-make of an older SCI-FI TV show.  This remake of V is a colossal disappointment."
Don't like subtitles in my movies.  Most Asian movies turn me off completely..  They are not my idea of entertainment
"I really liked this movie and wanted own a copy, what I got was a press release.  I am a little annoyed that this is all I got.  I'm currently looking at how I can delete it from my library."
i do not know who in the family was watching this one no one will admit to having watched it.
I used to like this guy. But the show is not funny not funny not funny. I did not bother seeing more than one episode and I doubt I will see another one. I could not even finish the first one. Really surprising.
"This is what happens when a comedian burns out. Dunham's entire thing is his puppets, with which he insults his audience and gets away with it.  On a personal comedy-club level, this is acceptable. Once commercialized with music and fake laugh tracks, this show went to hell. In Dunham's case, since his entire show is based upon puppets, to come up with new material, you have to come up with new puppets. The scenarios that he has come up with...visiting real people and businesses and warping out obnoxiousness for humor's sake...is NOT funny. Let's not forget Dunham is JNew W*rld Ord*r and his denigration of and overt racism for the White Christian and Muslim races is nothing short of criminal! You see what his race of people REALLY thinks about other races on the planet! His stuff is NOT funny and he's reached the end of his rope...perhaps he'll hang himself with it!"
"""The Jeff Dunham Show"" is a Comedy Central offshoot of Jeff Dunham's live shows using the familiar characters Walter, Achmed, Bubba J, Sweet Daddy Dee, Peanut, and Jose Jalapeno. In this seven episode season, Dunham introduces his characters onstage in front of an audience and then goes to a clip of them out in the real world trying to interact with other people.Watching the show, the format is VERY similar to the Dave Chappelle Show where he would interact with the audience and introduce segments and then go to the clip in a sketch comedy sort of way. However, the difference between Dave Chappelle and Jeff Dunham was that Chappelle was really good at this. When Dunham takes his characters out in public, the audience is supposed to believe they are real people and other actors and celebrities talk to the puppets. For example, Brooke Hogan is set up with Peanut on a date until Peanut ""eats"" some guacamole laced with nuts that he is allergic to and Achmed intercepts the date to put the moves on her. We see the characters' feet, dancing with other people, shooting guns, all sorts of things.If you like these characters and think they are funny on their own, than this show will probably work for you and you'll enjoy it. The magic of the previous live show format was that everyone marveled at Dunham's ability to DO these characters since ventriloquism isn't easy and there was always potential for him to start cracking up too much or making a mistake or Achmed's arm falling off which would increase the hilarity of any given bit. Taking the ""live"" quality out of the format with everything being pre-taped in these segments means they could have used as many takes as they wanted to finish a scene, so it just isn't as impressive as when it is done on the spot. Also the scenes themselves just aren't written that funny anyway.The concept of Jeff Dunham having his own show sounds great, but this format does not work for his brand of comedy and talents effectively.Bonus Features:Behind the Scenes shows the making of sketches of Achmed joining the Marines and also Achmed's funeral. Jeff Dunham is smart enough to know that Achmed is one of his most universally liked characters due to his talking in a wittle cute voice and varying inbetween that and temper rages. These segments aren't more than a few minutes and include some Comedy Central Promos.The unaired sketch is with Sweet Daddy Dee, a character I don't even remember from other specials I've seen from Jeff Dunham. He apparently gets to wear lots of chain bling and slang. His cut scene is Sweet Daddy Dee helping Germans get rid of an acapella group singing in the attic. Yes, the attic. He turns them into a Bavarian singing group to save them and when the Germans still don't like them, Nazi and ""The Sound of Music"" jokes abound. A good choice to cut.The bloopers show that his live bits introducing scenes often had to be retaped, especially when he starts coughing. He often forgets his lines and starts laughing and stuff goes wrong with the puppets getting their hands stuck on walls."
"I guess I'm the odd one because I found it to be rather stupid - sorry, couldn't think of another word to describe my feelings about it. I decided to fast forward through, hoping to come to something that would be interesting, funny, good.... Just when I thought it couldn't get any stupider, the girlfriend shows up and voila, it got stupider. Even the ending, which was supposed to be a ""gotcha"" I guess, just didn't have any juice. Was also difficult to see Meg Ryan, whom I'd always enjoyed, with the beginnings of messing up her face. A pathetic and somewhat creepy story."
"When she is informed by her husband of thirteen years that he is leaving her for another woman, Louise does what every self-respecting woman in her position would do: she conks him over the head, duct-tapes him to a chair, and threatens to hold him prisoner till he comes to his senses. Thus, for an hour-and-a-half, we're forced to watch as two self-indulgent crybabies - one a cheat, the other a raving psychotic - thrash out the details of their relationship in a tone so grating and mean-spirited that before long we're ready to send in our own hostage-negotiating team just to bring an end to all of our suffering.Despite the presence of Meg Ryan, Tim Hutton, Kristen Bell and Justin Long in key roles, ""Serious Moonlight,"" directed by Cheryl Hines and written by the late Adrienne Shelly (both of ""Waitress"" fame), is a hopelessly contrived, endlessly off-putting dark romantic comedy (a la ""The War of the Roses,"" albeit without the courage of that film's ending) that, I guess, is supposed to be every cheated-on spouse's idea of the perfect wish-fulfillment revenge fantasy (even if the fantasy winds up going awry in the end). But the claustrophobic setting, the sadistic tone, and the sheer unpleasantness of it all make it an excruciating experience to sit through. At one point, Hutton seems to be speaking for the audience when he states, ""It's like torture."" That's about as astute an example of built-in self-criticism as I've ever come across in a movie."
"Mind you, this review is coming from someone who could care less about the STAR TREK series and films. I went along with a few friends to see this, and while I really enjoyed the first forty minutes, the rest of the film was rather weak. I didn't care for any of the characters. Maybe it's just me. Science fiction is my least favorite genre. I can say this: the acting was well done. I was surprised by how good they were. Bravo to the actors. As for the rest of the film, well, lets just say I won't be seeing it again.See it if you must. Trekkies will get a lot more out of the film than I did. In fact, I'm sure they'll have a blast."
Not what I thought it would be...name is a little misleading. Perhaps I should have thought about it before selecting it for review.
Very disappointed wouldn't recommend it at all! It downloaded good but other than that it isn't worth any ones time!
This looked like an advertisement and not a movie or entertainment.  I simply could not watch all of it as it seemed a complete waste of time!
"Wow, what a pile of trash this show turned out to be... I guess obnoxious, sexist, chauvinist, offensive, disgusting, neanderthal humor is not my cup of tea, I would call this a guttural deeply embedded teenage boy fantasy goop comedy wannabe. I regret even watching the single episode of this trash. If you like this kind of show, have fun, but be warned it reaches way under the gutter of impropriety for its kicks... you've been warned. The series is rated ""M"" for mature of audiences... what demographic are these folks pushing for? Definitely not ""Mature"" that's for sure."
"I like action movies, etc. , how ever this attempt at launching another (Batman) falls real short of being believable.  I tried watching several episodes but could not get over the feeling of it being ridiculous."
This series was not as funny or interesting as I remember it to be.  I was disappointed.Why is there a minimum word usage
"The description for the Eclipse is 100% completely *wrong*.  This is NOT a suspense- it's a romance with subtle elements of drama.  We were all fooled into thinking this was some kind of horror story involving a ghost writer being tormented but it's anything but.  We were also fooled into believing there would be serious discussions involving what it feels like to actually witness a ghost for real and how the human mind feels after witnessing such a traumatic event.Instead it's about a ghost writer who meets a woman who shares similar interests in ghostly activity and they gradually fall in love.  Of course there's another guy in the picture, who's apparently a boxer.  Well the two guys hate each other and are secretly jealous over the woman without actually coming out and admitting it.  Instead we discover that the boxer basically believes the ghost writer is a stalker, while the ghost writer believes the boxer is a drunk.There's only two segments that are worth your time.  One takes place about an hour in when the ghost writer opens his bedroom closet and a scary event takes place in the floorboards, and the other is the fist fight between the two men above.  That's it.  The rest of the storytelling is meaningless and painful to watch.It's a shame too- this movie looks like it takes place in either Ireland or the gorgeous countrysides of England which are *perfect* locations for a horror setting.  Instead it doesn't even try for a supernatural setting.  I recommend skipping it completely."
"There is no mystery in this movie what so ever; there are no ghosts; there is nothing supernatural. Just ignorance. Everyone has lost someone that they love but to randomly toss in a couple of fakey slightly scarred head shots in spots that make no sense (e.g. in the car seat next to you; under some stuff in a room) or a couple of brief ghostly apparition scenes lasting a few seconds that do nothing - please! That any of these mysteries are part of illusionary compensation for losing someone is beyond belief. Also, to intermingle and confuse the one story line with another with an artificial good guy - bad guy - cute girl love triangle seems to be added to appease a certain viewing demographic but has no other function in this supposedly ""spine-tinglingly"" supernatural thriller.Finally, what does an eclipse have to do with the fundamental plot/story of the movie?"
"What a horrible bunch of garbage. Did you read Julius Caesar in high school. Well, even if you hated it, this version of it is way worse."
"I did not get past the first 5 minutes.  It is absolutely the worst acting, the worst script,, the &#34;dirtiest filming by perverted camerament&#34; and probably perverted directors.  It is too bad that Hollywood cannot seem to get its head out of the cesspool of degenerative morality. This is not recommended in any way, shape or manner. I suggest Hollywood come out of the closet and admit it is only interested in pornographic, tasteless, sophomoric scriptwriting."
I agree with other comments about how this video is not good for the family to watch.  Moral values of this film are very poor.I did not even get very far into the movie before seeing way too much sex and nudity. I would not recommend this movie to anyone with moral values.
"Corny plot,soap opera acting!!! Very poor production,will not watch any further episodes.Do not bother unless you are interested in &#34;Dallas&#34; in different costumes !"
"South Park is wonderful!  Comedy Central's censorship and cowardice is deplorable.  Maybe someday Comedy Central will realize the importance of art and the first amendment.  Until that day, I am sure as hell not giving them money for this blu ray."
This was probably the best season so far. Luckily I saw 200 & 201 when they were aired on TV (censored of course) but the fact that they are censored on DVD is complete BULL****!!!! I can't believe that Comedy Central released this DVD and still censored it.Usually I buy the seasons so I can watch them without commercials and UNCENSORED but I'm content with watching this season online for FREE. I returned this DVD to the store the next day. Comedy Central doesn't need my money anymore.
"Yeah, I know it is a cartoon but still it conjures up he real thing when I watch it. i only watched part of the first episode. Had to stop since I did not enjoy the subject manner and also the style of the cartoon was not on par with my other favorites. Just was not interesting to me."
This tv show is so bad it is virtually unwatchable. The characters are horrible at acting and stupid. The plots are boring and uneventful. And it is not the slightest bit funny. This show is nothing more than the average boring generic sitcom trash that is on nickelodeon these days. Don't waste your money.
"Okay, had to turn it off.  I did start skimming through scenes, trying to find some shred of intelligence, originality or even just thought...but all were sorely missing.AWFUL movie.  Don't waste your time on it."
"In ZOMBIE FARM,  FBI scientists have developed a chemical agent that helps in their interrogations of suspected terrorists. Unfortunately, the drug has a wicked side effect. It turns people into -all together now- flesh-eating zombies! Not surprisingly, zombies are created, go on a rampage, and eat the living. Then, the water supply is contaminated w/ the stuff, causing further murderous mayhem! There's even a zombie mailman on the loose! Luckily, the local muscle-bound, psycho has lots and lots of guns! Oh yeah, there's a group of cannibal hillbillies running around as well. They eat rats. If only they had eaten the sole existing print of this &#34;film&#34;..."
This movies was okay if you're really into zombies and watch every zombie movie that comes out. I've seen a lot better.
"Im all for low budget, b-movies but this one didn't even seem to try. Acting is poor. The sound and sound mixing is terrible. The premise is good but the execution couldn't have been worse. With zombies ALL AROUND YOU, how is it that these characters never paid attention to their surroundings and were constantly caught off guard&#8230; Theres a certain level of stupidity portrayed in these movies that's forgivable and tolerable but this movie takes the cake&#8230; can I give a rating lower than one please?"
Because we don't like it because it has rain because I did not like it didn't like that show no.
"Apparently these Mystery Science Theatre movies all have a built-in front row of &#34;hecklers&#34; in them. they weren't funny, just annoying and distracting. if it hadn't been for that I might have watched it, but kept fast-fowarding it thinking they would be gone but no luck. How stupid."
"As a Jew I was shocked by the bigotry of this piece of trash.  It's been a long time since I've seen such crude stereotyping of us.  This is not a well-written finely observed comedy.  The anti-semitism isn't strident, but couched in a series of lame jokes.  At one point of emotional breakthrough, the muslim main character purposefully punches out a rabbi while he is praying.  It's hard to imagine that Muslims would be happy with this either, as the main character is certainly made out to be woefully uneducated about other faiths.  What a piece of dreck.  (Look it up in an Yiddish dictionary!)"
Both the film and the subject. I've never seen a group of more dysfunctional and dangerous people ever. Not worth the time. Who wants to know about people of this ilk anyway. Yuk.
"It doesn't get any better throughout the entire movie. The characters are so flat, one-dimensional, and I didn't care what happened to any of them."
"My daughter and I struggled all the way through this  . . . movie. It was almost impossible to understand the dialogue. We had to look up the summary online to even know what was going on. We spent a good part of the time saying to each other, &#34;What did he/she say?&#34; I love movies with character and plot development; but if this movie had those, I must have missed it. We dismissed the review that said it was boring - need four more words - boring, boring, boring, boring. They were so right. The only good part that was noted was Colin Farrell's lovely accent. If only the movie had had a good sound engineer!"
"Background: A Selkie is a mythological sea creature that can become human.This movie consisted of the following stereotypic formula pieces tossed together to form the script such as: single divorced alcoholic fisherman; disabled daughter; dysfunctional mom and step father; suspicious town folk; homespun priest; Selkie brings good luck to the fisherman and daughter; criminal element added as a threat to the Selkie.Overall this Selkie interpretation seemed disjointed and shallow; lacking emotional depth and mystery. Not as good as ""The Seventh Stream""."
"Are you f'ning kidding me?! this is an excuse for hipster parents to seem cool. I am sorry nothing in this show has every brought me, my kids or the world joy. I put this on the other day for my 1 and a half year old and my 5 year old. My youngest watched it for like 5 minutes and vomited, and the older one begged me to turn it off, HE BEGGED!!"
"my kid put this on, but i would not pick it myself, you don't really learn anything from this show, just crazy characters doing goofy stuff.  i rather my kid watch something where they learn, like dinosaur train or sid the science kid."
"So you want me to believe that all these animals live together? and one is a 3ft ant? Now my kid is like I dont want giant ants eating us dad, his grandfather was killed by ants (in the war) and his uncle was killed by his Aunt (he does not understand ant/aunt yet) anyhow he watched this and now he has begun to wet the bed... thanks."
The content was more adult oriented and way over my kid's head.  WHy would they market this towards small kids?
We found it difficult to get into - didn't seem to be building the characters in an easy way.  Also some of the accents were hard to decipher.  Probably just not our cup of tea.
I'm sorry but I couldn't get through the first episode. I was just too morose. The character development was hideous.
"I only now just started watching Pretty Little Liars.While they are currently on something like season 4 I believe, I had trouble getting halfway through season one. What a ridiculous show. I started watching when nothing else was on. Even that isn't reason enough to continue. My complaints with the ridiculousness and inconsistency in this show are to many to list. The stupid decisions these girls make border on insulting to the intelligence of the audience. No matter what the target viewer is. The romanticized relationship between an English teacher (whom would be at the very least 24) and his 16 year old student is just irresponsible.  I can't image any parents thinking this show is ok viewing for their young teens or any adult finding this entertaining."
"Wait, there is an Asian character in the show?  Is she the main character? No. Oh so it is like every other show about snotty evil white people.  I'm bored. Really really bored of this stuff.  I don't even see pictures any more.  It's just a blur of white people, credit cards, and soft porn.  I keep hoping to see something different but nothing ever changes."
"Intriguing at times, but  the smart people sure are dumb. Startied out liking the first couple episodes, but the lead analyst investigating the conspiracy is so haphazard, he would have been killed early on. And why would a filthy rich widow investigate her husbands death alone and continues to investigate even after a direct death threat. The show and plot were just very weak and unbelievable."
"You don't really care what happens to the characters - - everyone is so flat.  The main character frowns a lot, looks at the same object over and over, no emotion at all.  Somehow I watched the whole thing, waiting for something to happen.  You never think &#34;I can't wait to see what happens&#34; because you don't really get involved if everything is so disconnected.  I can't imagine there being a second season for this."
"The series started out OK, but after three episodes, I lost interest. Hard to figure out just what the point is and how the characters interact. Not much suspense, particularly at end of episodes to keep the viewer coming back. Yawn."
"Series gets high marks in intrigue, character development, and acting. The path of its story is believable, even plausible for 11episodes.  Then suddenly we are expected to believe that a handful of old, white males are controlling the fate of the free world by manipulating those who are sworn enemies to the &#34;west&#34;.  Soooo, the world we see in Rubicon is in sharp contrast to that we see depicted in &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34; (supposedly true events set to drama). Either it takes exhaustive intelligence resources, years of analysis, and unexpected good fortune to finally make breakthrough in finding the most high-profile terrorist in the world-- or, as portrayed in &#34;Rubicon&#34;, the whole material world is controlled-not by an industry, or a conglomerate of industries- but a few conspirators. Such an outlandish assumption REQUIRES adequate explanation. Otherwise, the story is an insult to those fighting our battles- and their loved ones. No wonder this series stopped production when it did. The storytellers wound themselves up so tight in their own trap, there was no way to continue with anyone to follow."
"I don't know where to start because it was that uninteresting. Save yourself the trouble and watch something else, you'll be more entertained with anything but this show."
"I used to enjoy Futurama, but not anymore. It is almost like Matt Groening is saying how far left can we go. It is amazing to me how anti-christian this show has gone. This eposide is just anothe rexample. I still watch the show sometimes, but only on TV. I will not pay for this show and I turn the channel when it starts to get to be to much.Sad to see Futurama destroyed like this."
I REALLY HATE IT BECASUE I DON'T LIKE IT THAT WAS REALLY SCARY AND WE DO NOT LIKE IT THAT WAS OK
I don't like it all it was very great that was for adults and was not beautiful and that is not pretty
Elijah Wood is repugnant in the sex scenes. He should stick to playing elfs.  The script and plot are boring and badly executed. There are some fine actors stuck in this awful mess. Don't waste your time.
"My big problem with this film is that it simply does not flow. It's like a composition that meanders all over the place and does not fully explore any thesis. Characters do things which one simply wouldn't do in real life. If I was a graduate student at Oxford, I surely wouldn't drop the ""F"" bomb on a Don whom I want to become my mentor. Romantic relationships appear ""out of the blue."" Some characters disappear into thin air and the plot is so disjointed that I felt the whole thing was a waste of time. It's a pity because the trailer looked good and Lenora Watling is certainly easy to look at, but Elijah Wood is just plain HORRIBLE and quite frankly, other than her looks, Ms. Watling doesn't impress much either. Hurt spends his time pontificating and the whole thing is a jumble. Don't bother with it."
"Have you ever known someone that thought they were just the cleverest mind in the circle - that had that self indulgent, narcissistic belief that they and they alone could create or solve the most convoluted brain teasers. OK, well maybe some of those attributes. Well, this movie was the film incarnation of that person. Just a predictable boring studio's pointless production of contrivance."
"We opened this because the storyline sounded provocative - a mystery at Oxford.  It was not very intriguing starting out, but...willing to wait (sometimes a story has to &#34;warm up.&#34;)  This one became purient-plus (I realize that there is not such word, but how else to emphasize the content of this movie), and must admit we cannot give a full review - we turned it off.  Guess we were naive, for such an open sexual exhibition was not something we would have expected (unless the movie were rated R or xxx - which this one was not.)  We would say that it was right up the alley for a voyeur.  Suggestive is one thing, but this was eversomuch more.Therefore, can say if you enjoy visual sex, this is the movie for you. If not, would advise you to look elsewhere."
"After watching it for 15 minutes with my wife, I turned it off.  It was just too confusing of a plot and I have heard enough of the new morality philosophy.  ugh!!!"
"I couldn't watch past 30 minutes....actually, on the 15th minute I went to make some tea which didn't help, by the way. The acting is just terrible, not believable....skip it, it's not worth it. I can't believe you had to pay 9.99 to watch it on demand when it came out originally."
"This sounded good but it was bad. The gratuitous sex was unnecessary, and the overacting wasn't pleasant. The story didn't seem plausible either."
"Unenlightened drivel, acting high brow.  Full of foul language throughout, as far as I know (I couldn't finish the last fourth of the movie because I was so offended by the continued foul language and intolerance of religious persons).  I was hoping it would get better s it went along, showing the professor and his students were mistaken in their beliefs.  But alas they never learned the truth because they did not even want to believe there is truth.  What kept me going for as long as I did was seeing how these atheists act and think.  It did remind me of the bullying done at universities to Christians."
"Fell asleep......Fell asleep......Fell asleep......Fell asleep......Fell asleep......You need to find and direct better shows. As a Harvard , Yale film student this is a C grade"
I never made it to the first commercial break. This is a stupid vapid show. You can easily skip this one.
Way too cutesy and not very intelligent. Not believable. I guess I need some grit in my tv watching. Watch Alias instead.
"If I could give this show a less than zero rating, I would. The lead character is obnoxious, rude and just made me want to hurl something at the TV screen. I can't beleive I wasted $1.99 I can't tell you how much this character annoyed me. I watched the entire episode because I thought it would improve. It didn't. Don't waste your time or money on this junk."
"I saw the reviews on here and read some internet posts about how great this show was, so I bought it. I'd seen a clip of the show on the internet and thought it was interesting, but the lead just gave me bad vibes. Watching the first three episodes last night, I just couldn't take it anymore! Callie, his love interest, is totally annoying. She is a nurse who also goes to medical school and has a son. Jim is a know-it-all punk who always magically has the upper hand. There is no explanation at all for why or how he outsmarts everyone, he just does. The characters is very smug and unlikeable. Maybe he appeals to narcissistic Generation X and Y types, but not me. Furthermore, Jim doesn't have any depth. He is in jerk mode all of the time. He's not even vulnerable. This is the worst written show on TV!The character is just not believable as a cop. He acts like a rich prep schooler. I believe that he is supposed to be middle-class, but the writers probably can't even comprehend how to create a middle-class character, so they based one off of their own privileged lives. It's almost like they couldn't stand writing Callie as just a nurse, so they made her a nurse who is trying to be a doctor! Now she's classy enough for the show!I got bored during episodes. The shows I watched began with a murder, then just became disjointed as time went on. Jim would investigate, meet up with Callie, make sarcastic comments, then there would be a final magical scene that resolves everything perfectly. The Carlos Gomez character is the only interesting one that comes across as human, but even he has no chemistry with the lead.I just couldn't stand the show anymore and I put it up for sale. I really don't recommend it."
"I didn't like this program, it is inane and a pilot that must be trying to boost the actor's career, and he overacts his part in comparison to the rest of the show. The character takes life too lightly considering what his job is and acts the fool non-stop. I don't think there is even a point to the plot."
"To start with, once again we are seeing some suspiciously polished five star reviews. This show, however, is not at all five star worthy by any honest stretch of the imagination. The show has low production values, low budget actors, and consequently poor acting. And for a crime show it makes leaps and jumps that make it impossible to follow, which means there is no chance that the viewer will ever figure out who the killer is. As well, there is a lot of product placement -- even more so then usual nowadays. The show also is something of a surreptitious pro-smoking cigarette commercial, with all the young hip, cool people conspicuously enjoying - really enjoying -- their cigarettes. That this show lasted four years is more of an indictment on our society and our exceedingly low expectations than any evidence that it was a ""successful"" program. Below are some sites you can check out about the very common practice of fake reviews. Small businesses are popping up all over who profit from full time fake review writing. Check it out, and inoculate yourself, if you haven't already, against this despicable practice.http://www.forbes.com/sites/suwcharmananderson/2012/08/28/fake-reviews-amazons-rotten-core/http://www.wikihow.com/Spot-a-Fake-Review-on-Amazon.Comhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/23/new-york-fake-online-reviews-yoghurt"
"I could only sit through ten minutes of this series. I am a big fan of BBC comedies, however, this not on the same scale as 'The Last Of The Summer Wine, As Time Goes By, or Keeping Up Appearances. This is a waste of money. Thanks!"
"I am a fan of British comedies & Dawn/Saunders productions. This cast includes too many big name English actresses to count. BUT: it was too annoying to continue watching past a few minutes.  I couldn't believe it, there were several of my favorite English actresses assembled with a potentially clever premise & they were irritating the heck out of me. I can appreciate the desire to capitalize on the small English village eccentrics angle but not to the point of being gross or making fun of physical or mental disabilities. Maybe it's my own Texan sensitivities. I'll just rewatch &#34;Calendar Girls&#34; for this genre."
I bought this once 2 years ago and will never buy again I can only watch on amazon or with amazon software and could never burn this is not buying or owning this is rentingAnd I'm not falling for it again this also why I don't buy from iTunes
"I apologize to Nickelodeon for my poor critique of ""iCarly,"" but I just don't like this show. The humor is composed of bad word-play that can barely inspire chuckles in anybody, along with funny words and speech. It just comes off as cheesy, and albeit a bit of the humor in this situation comedy is usually the sort of comedy that I would find humorous, for some reason it just cannot make me laugh. True, a few times there have been a couple of gags that have left me rolling on the floor laughing, but for the most part this series just does not amuse me. There are a few episodes that I like to watch, but I really do not like ""iCarly"" very much. Although there have been some humorous jokes, a lot of times you will find more cheese in this series than you would in a Wisconsin supermarket. If you want a hilarious, entertaining television program, watch ""Rugrats,"" ""Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,"" or ""Hey, Arnold!"" I'm really, really sorry, Nickelodeon; I just do not always like to watch iCarly."
"Centurion, a Roman empire epic set in Britain in 117 AD, has many of those qualities we see in the best of this genre: A plot line as empty as Gladiator's; self-polishing abs breast plates for all officers; and Life of Brian's attention to historical accuracy. It adds blood arcing for some distance into the sky when a lance meets an eyeball. And there are two feral lady barbarians, one blond with what looks like bad teeth (Aeron, played by Axelle Carolyn) and one brunette, whose teeth look just fine, as do her breasts (Etain, played silently by Olga Kurylenko). The brunette fancies skins when she goes out hunting Romans in the deep winter forest and scanty skins when in a hut.Centurion, in other words, is as silly as they come. Briefly, it's about an attempt by the Ninth Legion, led by General Titus Flavius Virilus (Dominic West), to march north into what is now Scotland and eliminate the Pict threat. Evidently Virilus never read up on the fate of Publius Quinctilius Varus, no general but a good administrator. Marching deep into the Teutoburg Forest in what is now Germany, he and his three legions were attacked by combined Germanic tribes. Varus committed suicide in the middle of the battle. His three legions disintegrated. Probably 20,000 or more Roman soldiers died compared to a handful of barbarians.General Virilus, virile and confidant, who didn't read his history, marches his men into the thick forests of Pictland.  Flash forward to the next day. Virilus is in chains in the squalid camp of the Pict king. Most of his men have been slaughtered. Later, a handful of survivors led by Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) try to rescue him. No luck. The Pict king's young son is killed and the general dies in a forced fight with Etain. The seven Romans escape and head south with a handful of Pict hunters (led by Etain and Aeron) hot on their trail. Pict hunters die one by one; the Roman seven almost die one by one.What's good about Centurion? The make-up and the set-designer. Picts look as dirty and flea-bitten as their filthy encampments. Most of the Romans look as filthy as the Picts. There are stunning, craggy, shivering cold scenes of the Highlands.What lacks in Centurion? Characters we can give even a small hoot for. Most of the time we can't remember one from another. Fassbender seems to be a rising star, but all he's called upon to do in this movie is fight, run monotonously and look tired. Only one actor in the cast stands out as tough and smart, and that is that fine actor Liam Cunningham. He's made a lot of drek, but look for him inShooting the Past,Dog SoldiersandThe Wind That Shakes the Barley. The movie's battle scenes, particularly Virilus' march north, is shot only to show slashing swords and more spurts of blood. There's no way to follow the battles. A plot also is lacking. The first third is an excuse for gore. The last two-thirds is an excuse for gore and long-distance running. The roles of Etain and Aeron are a sop to the 18-29-year-old audience the director seems to care most for.Centurion is not a movie. It's a mediocre comic book for all those who love abs-enhancing armor, horsehair helmet crests and the inspiring National Geographic maps showing the Roman Empire at its greatest extent."
"This movie has gushing blood and lots of use of the &#34;f&#34; word and not much else.  Not even the women were spared from punched out eyeballs and blood oozing everywhere.  They had their lipstick on though.  It could have been worse, but only with lots of effort."
"Re-creation of east coast cop shows thinly veiled in a California setting.  Every Actor has an equally thinly veiled to not veiled New York / Jersey mush-mouth that conflicts the geological location attempted thus the reality of the show. EXCEPT for Tricia Helfer, who can do no wrong..."
"American culture is no longer embarrassed by any kind of bad behavior so the quaint and stupid social faux pas committed by the characters in this program are likely NOT be understood or found funny in American culture.Laughing at other people's embarrassment is cruel. Intelligent and kind people are charmed to laughter by clever irony or juxtaposition of ideas, not when someone else is hurt, as in slapstick, or stupid, or embarrassed."
"First off--if no stars as a rating were available, that is what I would give this show. As some other reviewers with half a brain have noted, this is quite possibly THE WORST COP SHOW EVER. Even tho I purchased the complete first season on Amazon, the pilot episode was SO bad I couldn't watch any others. Why is it so awful? In the first 5 minutes of the show we see the 'Rookies' (everyone looking like a GAP model) drinking & partying like total idiots, having their graduation in a bar. Then we cut to their first day on the job where they spend 90% of their time with their guns drawn saying ""don't make me shoot you"". AWFUL, STUPID, HORRIBLE! This show is an insult to anyone in law enforcement and to the public they serve. Mind you I have no problem with 'pretty actors' doing soap opera/drama. But this show is like watching a bunch of adults run around 'playing' cops & robbers but with real guns instead of toys. With all the great cop shows out their (the new ""Southland"" is terrific, the ""Shield"" was awesome, Patick Swazey's last show ""The Beast"" was great), you don't need to waste your time on this poor excuse for entertainment."
I've not been able to watch this as  I keep getting error messages from Amazon! I don't have problems with any other movie subscriptions except for the Prime free. Very disappointing :(
"I did not care for it at all, very boring and depressing, was greatly dissapointed, but to be fare it is not my Genere of tv"
"I loved this show and even got my wife into it. Now she repels any other tv suggestions I may have. Why? Because they canceled the series! So now Ive got The Event (which I would feel guilty if I said this was great and people went and paid the per episode price, I'm a prime member so I its included). The Event, along with The 4400 to mention another great show that was canceled without any closure, had a lot of different story lines which had the potential for some great stuff.  That is the reason for the hate it rating, producers and executives don't deserve positive credit for shows with great writing and acting that they themselves cancel. I stopped looking to network or ad absed channels for good TV. Of course AMC has some exceptions as does FX. Oh well that's my 2 cents."
"The previews/lead up to ""The Event"" were interesting and I was looking forward to a riveting, well thought out and well acted new series. Not so. This series is boring, the dialog is boring and the acting is double boring. The writers are trying to create an edge of your seat build up moment, but it falls completely flat and left me with not even a warmed over feeling.So not worth it. I will be very surprised if this lasts for more than 1 season. Flash Forward was way better and wasn't on for more than a season."
It was mind numing. It had no draw for my atention atr all. sad really. blah blah blah blahza. did n't care for it.
"didn't care for the flick at all, in fact my whole family had me stop the show about 15 minutes into it."
"TV Series that are mostly predictable & dull conversations are the worst, and I think this show is a huge offender.  I found myself wanting to skip through conversation after conversation.  If your show is going to be so heavy on the conversation, it behooves the writers to produce an interesting & original line of discourse.  This show is a rehash of a rehash of a rehash, and then rehashed.  Do not watch."
"It is difficult to review a TV Series when there is no sound. We view Amazon on a Roku box which works fine for most of Amazon's items, but the Event had good picture and no sound. Amazon refused to get involved and Roku were helpless. Bottom line is that our attempt to watch this on Amazon's streaming service was a waste of time. We eventually watched on Netflix using our Roku box."
Very slow start to whatever plot they are attempting to build?? Acting is sub par. Could not even make it past 30 minutes of the pilot.
"One of the few good things on this show was actor Stephen Dorf.  Although this show had plenty of flaws, I kept watching primarily for him.  However, this was his last episode on the show and with that, I had completely had it with this reincarnation of one of my favorite shows, the original LAW AND ORDER set in NYC.  The problems with this show are manifold.  The worst is that it is trying to be a hybrid of the original show with a CSI show.  So instead of the excellence of a team which had Jerry Orbach and Sam Waterston in the gritty New York scene, there is this technicolor mess of a show trying to infuse us with the coolness of the hopped up LA scene.  All this is missing is the Horatio from CSI Miami with his sunglasses to cement it as a truly unbelievable show.  The CRIMINAL INTENT version of this show was also ruined by constantly reinventing a concept which worked.  It too became unwatchable with Jeff Goldblum at the helm.  My recommendation is to skip this show and stick to the reruns of the original, especially the ones with Waterston and Orbach in their primes."
"There are no surprises in this Law and Order series with predictable plots and characters except for a little more sunshine, LA location wise.  Now that ""Criminal Intent"" is off the air and ""SVU"" has become wooden, that is, everyone is phoning in their performances, I don't see this West Coast version coming up with anything fresh.  After a lot of years, I am crying ""Uncle!"".  Not even $1.99 per episode can entice.  I would rather be reading a good book."
"Yeah, probably not gonna wanna pay for this unless you just can't get enough MARMADUKE in your life. My son was feeling like that so we bit the big apple. He was like WHAT? Why is it so short???  Hey, my question indeed."
"FREAKONOMICS (90 mins., various directors) is a ramshackle documentary presenting various statistical theories, based on a book (Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (P.S.)) by ""economist"" Steven Levitt and journalist Stephen Dubner. While I had a long-standing desire to read the book, I hadn't heard of the concordant documentary and was anxious to see it when I did hear about it.Before I go on, let me regale you with the latest shill's message to me regarding this film: ""It is your assertions of racism, etc. that are anti-intellectual. I could, in fact argue that YOUR discussion of ""Black names"" reflects a rather insidious degree of bigotry. In addition, your criticisms of the quality of the data are amazingly uninformed.""WOW. Sell a lot of books this way, do you? By insulting an honest reviewer, then demanding back-up evidence? This is a REVIEW, not a doctoral thesis. The idiots who made this film have the burden - not I. Mine is onerous enough writing to audiences filled with readers like YOU. And the filmmakers are the ones who raise the whole issue of ""black"" names, not I. And that is what you can expect from a film like this.The film is a huge let-down; it certainly steered me away from the desire to read the book. I've come to the conclusion that the appellation ""rogue economist"" (as Levitt calls himself) is a big red flag with Sarah Palin's silhouette on it.Full of somewhat interesting but ultimately useless and mildly offensive trivia, the documentary's biggest mystery is why several directors were hired to film the various segments. Some of the segments are downright insulting to the intelligence.In a word, stupid. Or, in another word, Wallywood. So here are the basic parts of this broken machine:REALTORS ROBBING CLIENTS: Levitt and Dubner yammer about the way realtors rip off their clients in the good old American home-selling scheme. While I found it informative, it could have been done more briefly and a lot more deeply.CHILDREN'S NAMES: This is about whether a child's name will affect that child's success later in life. It seems Levitt's whole point is to show how certain names could lead white girls to a stripper's life. I found this segment racist, aside from being offensive and frankly stupid.We all know the black community prefers specific names, and the documentary explains the well known phenomenon of black people getting the shaft when it comes to jobs. I doubt that is only because of the names the black community chooses but this film insists it is. In any case, I do not need statistics to explain that to me: I am half black.However, Levitt (the apparent heavy-lifter in all the fact-finding) tells us more: did you know that among rich white folk, the most popular names for girls used to be Jessica, Lauren, Ashley, Sarah and Emily? Among ""the Wal~Mart crowd"" (their term, not mine), the most popular names were Ashley (""Trashley""), Jessica, Amanda, Samantha and Brittney.I was having a hard time understanding how the white strippers relate to the problems of the black community and vice-versa, but there you are. Apparently, these two stalwart researchers also claim that the name Tyrone ""is a black name."" I have news for you: it is not a ""black"" name. The only thing in the world that is ""black"" in this context is the skin of some people. And that's not ""black"", it's ""brown"".Gee, I guess pointing that out makes me the racist here.SUMO MATCHES ARE FIXED: Next we have a segment about Sumo wrestling corruption in Japan. Plus the exciting topic about Japanese police and their general incompetence. It's really a segment about religious corruption because Sumo is a sort of extension under the Shinto religion. This was a good segment, but a totally confusing mish-mash if you are not already familiar with Japanese culture - which this documentary assumes you are.ROE V. WADE DROPPED OUR CRIME RATES: These dummies claim Roe v. Wade and the whole abortion issue might just be the answer to lower crime rates. How's that? - you may well ask. Levitt did a study of the evil Romanian dictator Ceaucescu and his draconian you-have-to-have-a-baby-NOW laws from circa 1989. Levitt found that about 20 years later, Romanian crime had skyrocketed. Coincidence?Based on this interestingly weak observation, Levitt decided to study U.S. crime rates dating 20 years after the Roe v. Wade decision. He claims he found crime had plummeted. Levitt asserts 50% of that total drop was thanks to Roe v. Wade and all the criminals-to-be that were never born. Allow me to explain why this is bad statistical use: Levitt freely asserts 50% of the drop in crime to be thanks to Roe v. Wade. He presents no evidence that he delved into ALL the necessary statistics to make that assertion.What is freely asserted is freely negated - any critics of my review familiar with THAT? If anyone expects me to quote statistical analysis here for the purpose of refuting these clowns, well, I don't have to do so. The burden is Levitt's. And he fails.BRIBE THE KIDS TO GET GOOD GRADES: For me this was the most stupid segment: an experiment in Chicago to bribe 9th graders to get good grades. The authors of the experiment believed bribes can and should be used to get these kids to do their schoolwork. As opposed to getting out on the street, joining a gang and possibly making several thousands of dollars a day doing whatever it is the gangs do.This type of film pains me. It is the usual pseudo-intellectualism camouflaged as something I can only label as 'significant trivia', and it has more to do with arrogant researchers who are full of themselves than it has to do with facts. Naturally, it deeply moves pseudo-intellectuals. This film tries to be light-hearted and humorous, but it falls flat.These ""experts"" are offensive idiots: they manage to insult the poor of all colors (is that funny?), the black community (oh, that MUST be funny), struggling parents (definitely not funny and most unwise) AND kids in dire need (just plain horrible and psycho). We can safely add that the authors/film narrators in some odd way have made pro-abortion people feel weird also.Imagine how they have offended cinema and the art of documentation.This certainly put me off reading the authors' book. Since I have a little bird who tells me things, I have had it brought to my attention that Levitt and Dubner ""read reviews"". Well, gentlemen, I hope you learned something from my review. The public has a right to know all balanced criticisms. Apparently, some strange enemy has read my review already anyway.Please know: my review is a great deal more fair than the documentary."

"While I found a lot of the subjects interesting, I thought the film was seriously slow and boring. I like documentaries and even though this one starts out promising, it quickly gets old and really doesn't give us much insight on the subjects at hand. In other words, it doesn't do what it set out to do. Instead of raising awareness, interest and answering questions, it just has you reaching for the off button on your remote! Read the book, you'll be much better off."
"I have no opinion of the video, since I couldn't get it to play on my pc.  sorry!  I'm still trying to resolve whether it was a wireless issue, a spooling issue, or a video streaming issue."
"I felt thoroughly ripped off with this film. It was infantile, stupid, tedious and embarrassing.The special effects were laughable."
"I fell asleep... that says it all. Another movie where you want to see the monsters, but they're just barely visible."
"Not even worth while renting.  All the reviews seem to be written by those who have some vested interest in the film.  A lot of cheap movie shots of Mexico somewhere and homes still not repaired from Hurricane Katrina event.  Standard boy meets girl who is already engaged but ends up not wanting to getting married to her husband to be, but falls in love with the guy she has the adventure with.  Like the last Titanic movie disaster.  I waste a lot of time watching movies, and this was very much of a waste of time.  The final seen of the monsters is some kind of land walking Octopus types with a lot of extra arms, which could not exist on land.  The Octopus type body is made only for a water environment and could not move on land.  And these monsters were not all that distinct.  The monsters do a lot of guttural and screeching sounds.  Very stupid.  At the end you have the two main actors staring at these monsters with mouth open wonderment."
"Although the premise of this movie was somewhat intriguing, the characters, editing, pacing, and acting were not.  I've heard of slow, but THIS was slower than a 3-legged turtle.  It seems that aliens have landed and occupied earth six years ago, there is now an ""infected"" zone where you cannot leave, and a wall has been constructed in keep people in/out.  Yeah, I get the symbolism there, but this movie becomes an exercise in a very lame excuse to tell a love story.  I didn't care for either character, the monsters look like floating octopi, and I never felt the characters were in peril of anything--except their own insipidness (if that's even a word).  So go ahead and watch...BORE yourself to death..."
"How to tell when a movie is below budget cheap.(1.) No subtitles for either English or people with hearing problems.(2.) Intro that makes no intelligent sense to anyone with a high school or above educational background. NASA finds alien life forms in our solar system which have been identified as ""the writer's of  this movie"". NASA decides to bring said alien life back to Earth who start out looking remarkably like common wood decay fungi (e.g. Trametes versicolor) but then acquire the anatomy of an ocean dwelling cross between a jellyfish and a squid. Unfortunately for our alien writers who never passed 10th grade biology or 9th grade physical science the physics of this anatomy is mechanically unsustainable walking about on the surface of Earth.(3.) Handheld cinematography that looks like something your Neanderthal relatives took while touring deteriorating industrial, trash and natural disaster wreckage in Central America. Really really bad/cheap CGI on our poor stranded jellysquid. The jellysquid's agent should be fired or eaten.(4.) Actors with the emotional impact of the above mentioned fungi and the dialogue capacity of seven monosyllabic words per edited scene.(5.) Props in the movie consisted mostly of road signs that said ""Infection Area""; fungi on trees; army surplus gas masks; a crane to lift a truck then drop it which is edited to make it seem like the aforementioned jellysquid did it.(6.) Whale sound effects that unfortunately for our alien writers, had they spent $10 to hire a marine biologist they would have found out, that for the most part are of a frequency pattern that works primarily under water. Which brings up the question of what planet in our solar system did these creatures come from?(7.) It takes 45 minutes into this handheld travelogue before anything interesting happens and another 45 minutes to hope it ends quicker."
"Time i will never get back, you know what im saying? There are good creature movies and bad ones, even some of the old 50's rubber suit movies were better."
"After aliens invade Earth, a photo journalist agrees to escort a tourist back to America.  After paying for safe passage around an infected zone of Mexico, the tourist finds her passport stolen and is not allowed passage.  Together her and the journalist must make thier way to the border through the infected zone.  This movie is much like ""District 9"".  Aliens have landed and are now living among us.  While ""District 9"" was original at the time I did not like it at all.  This one I thought was worse.  Its hard for me to find anything good to say about it, so I'll make this review short.  The effects were good, and it was another good idea for a movie.  But the main problem with the movie for me is that it's sooooooo drawn out.  If you took all the action out of ""Cloverfield"" you would have this movie.  I had to struggle to get through it.  Very boring.  I didn't enjoy it at all.  I give it a D-.Would I watch again? - Not even if real aliens invaded and this was the only way to avoid them!!"
"I picked this one because I am into syfy, but this just did not fill the bill. I would not reccomend it to anyone."
"As we all know, the best Gordon Ramsay video is an uncensored video.  From what I'm seeing in these reviews, this DVD is censored!  No way!  I'm not buying it if it's censored.  Why would his first seven seasons be ""raw & uncensored"", and now season 8 is censored?  Nope!  I'm not buying this DVD."
"Although I like the concept and the premise of this program, I find the execution to be a turn-off. It's much too busy for my taste. They don't let a thought develop without interrupting it with another speaker and another thought. It becomes a challenge to the viewer, a challenge which is not rewarded."
"Clich&eacute; after clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;, does not deliver. Not even randomly. The procedural is just so bad that it could have worked as a joke, but it instead tries to be too serious. The writing is painful Of the two main characters, she is as stiff, boring, and sanctimonious as the worst parody of a career woman attempts to be. He is a clown disguised as what I guess was meant to be a New York yuppie with suits and sneakers, bear, and hat. The love story is without chemistry. Naturally. The episodes plots are lame."
"Lisa Scottoline is salivating over a human drama and murder, telling what kind of exciting story this made for her book (didn't mention her pocket) for a full hour. Her excitement over a tragedy was unbearable. She maybe could have faked some sadness.This show has boring stories (except the first episode) that goes on forever."
This is a rehash of the dreadful &#34;reality TV&#34; junk.  Just terrible.  Why any published author would participate in such a venture is difficult to conjure.
"I saw one of these episodes years ago about a ghost siting of a solider on a battlefield and it was interesting.I only got through one episode,it was bad and boring. I am not sure this series is still on the air but if its not I can see why.Id pass on this."
"This is a really terrible movie.  Let me describe it by splitting the film into two sections.  Let me explain the first half first.The first half of the movie is totally fitting for the Lifetime Movie Network.  It's about a woman who lives in an apartment building and, while a man is fixing a plumbing problem under her kitchen sink,  they fall in love.  Little does she know the man who has a history of mental illness.  Well she DOES eventually realize this but not until she's already committed to the guy.Let me state that what the guy does for a living is completely meaningless.  He works in real estate and it's a family business, hence the constant sarcastic bickering between him and his father about ""making the right choices for the sake of the family"".  None of this matters though.  The focus here is on the man and woman attempting to hit off a relationship.Well for the entire first half of the movie, the man and woman go through the routine ups and downs of being in a relationship, however since the man has a mental condition due to him having to tragically witness his mother jumping and killing herself when he was a child, this problem interferes with his ability to want to have kids with the woman and... now things get worse- MUCH worse.  Apparently the woman brought back personal feelings that weren't meant to see the light of day.  Now these mental problems have been unleashed.  Sounds fun so far, right?  Read on.Let me mention that everything about the man and woman falling in love is flat out *boring* because I've seen an identical build-up of typical relationship highs and lows in several other films, so nothing different was done here at all.  I mean it was written in such a predictable way here that it's totally pointless to watch.  In fact the one and only scene that made an effort to stand out and be different is when the man gets furious at his wife who's simply minding her own business at a dinner party and he comes storming in the room, grabs her by the hair and pulls her out of the house.  Nobody at the party seemed to think this was unordinary behavior or stood up for the woman.  What?Even worse is that whenever something good happens such as this, the writing completely falls apart so the very next scene shifts in another direction, thereby destroying all suspense that could have occurred.  Terrible.  It's obvious the man is crazy but nothing really suspenseful other than the guy destroying a book shelf and making a few threats ever seem to come out of it.Now the second part of the film.  This is when the storyline completely falls flat.  This is when the amount of confusion will probably leave you speechless.  Well apparently the wife disappears, so we flash several years into the future with the husband as an old man, in a courtroom, and attempting to explain his innocence but... now the storyline is completely focused around the characters as OLDER people so suddenly it's like watching a completely different movie, and... get THIS- now we're seeing the man accused of murdering his wife dressed up as a woman *himself* and involved in conflicts with other older people that do absolutely nothing but confuse the living heck out of me.Suddenly MURDERS are now occurring, which is odd because you'd think growing older would mean becoming wiser and less violent.  Suddenly as an old man, he's doing drugs with a friend in a car and wearing make-up like a woman.  Whatever (or whoever) is responsible for these murders being committed when it would seem these characters don't have much time on the planet anyway since old age has creeped in is beyond my understanding- WAY beyond it.Bored by the generic writing of the first half and confused by the second half makes this movie an absolute failure.  A double dose of failure in fact because ""bored and confused"" is the worst of BOTH worlds when it comes to movie storytelling.  Ugh!  I strongly recommend avoiding this hogwash!"
"I should have rented this confused, disjointed hodge-podge from Netflix, rather than having wasted the miniscule amount it cost me to purchase from Costco.Utter junk!  Although ""trooper"" me had to stick it out to the very end, hoping for a simulacrum of improvement.Which never manifested."
This was more of a comical depiction than a more serious show regarding the people that were portrayed in it.  I really don't have any more to say about this as I was disappointed with the series.
"This series is awful. If you like looking at very faint dots of refracted light taken in photo, or Blankets that were obviously tied to a string in a manner to move them then you might like it. Everyone claims to see a ghost, but their footage is so poor that a ton of other explanations could account for what is presented. Like Bigfoot and UFO's... When real concrete, scientific and fully documented proof is discovered then all this is just non-sense."
"Both my 4 year old nephew, and 5 month old son didn't want to watch this show.  Not meant for entertaining small kids, that's for sure."
"Only the first episode is included with Amazon Prime, so I'm only rating that.This series, despite its intriguing title plays on sensational claims that are not supported by evidence.  I wouldn't consider it worthy of a channel dedicated to &#34;history&#34;."
"The show makes it look like they're going to reveal mysteries but then they choose the most mundane conclusions for every &#34;so called&#34; mystery they examine. For example, the missing cornerstone of the white house is dismissed as a mystery because it's to big and heavy to move. Really?! That's pretty obvious from the beginning isn't it? Yes, it's a big heavy rock. It's missing. Well it has to be there because it's a big and heavy rock. Mystery solved!  That's pretty much how this show goes. Very boring and no fun to watch."
"This show is about as phony as any ghost hunting show. First, Brad Meltzer. Why does he need to stand in front of a field of mathematical formulas as if to suggest he is a higher order of intelligence when nothing anyone does has to do with math? The onset of the stories sounds interesting that Brad gives in the set up. The problem is that Brad does nothing!! He sits in front of a green screen and does no investigation himself. He has this team of ""experts"" who are totally laughable go out and ""discover"" the truth. One guy is writing notes the whole time (scribble scribble). The chick usually has nothing to do. The other guy is the driver who seems like he is still learning his job.Most of the time in their investigation, they take some red herring and find themselves out in left field from where they began. So what they find ends up being irrelevant and has no solid relationship to the initial conspiracy. I am watching the Lewis and Clark episode and whether or not Lewis committed suicide or not. In the end, there was no real information brought to the table that was not already said in the beginning.Much of the show is already set up, even before the so called investigations occur. There is no real inquiry, its just published information. As the case with Lewis, clearly the idea of whether he killed himself or not is not a new one as there are a bunch of books already published. In fact, they go and talk to an author and gets lots of ""yes's"".The show in general comes off as series of smoke and mirrors. Lots of flashy editing, zoom cuts, sound effects, and incidental music to create the effect. Brad chimes in saying nothing important, but usually either retelling what has happened, or foretelling what his ""experts"" will find out. So everything is already figured out.I watch the show out of curiosity and to see how many holes are in the episode. I really dont find him convincing or that the show brings out any secret history that might already be written elsewhere. I have never read his books and can see he has some reputation in the field. But like Dan Brown - they are fiction. No matter how real the facts are by themselves, they are linked by fiction.The show has one philosophy: ""Proverbs for Paranoids #4: If you keep them asking the wrong questions, it does not matter what the answer is."""
Not much to say except this is proof of the dumbing down of our country.  I didn't finish the program.
"Gold rush season number two  was a complete wast of time, and I did not enjoy this program at all."
"A waste of time and money.  Theatrical exclamations and much head shaking by the author of a ""book"" on the subject.  Apparently he saves the ""Interesting"" details for his book, (if there were any at all)."
$1.99 for this a 2 minute trailer of the 2011 Christmas episode!!. What up with that!! charged for a two minute preview for the episode.
I don't know.  Scary snowmen?  I suppose after all these years it is difficult to come up with new stories.  I paid to watch this one and wish I hadn't.  Really miss the writing of the first couple of seasons of the 'new' Dr. Who.
"DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!This is NOT the episode.It is the under 2 minute ""prequel"" that is available FREE at the BBC America website.Someone at Amazon is either incompetent (at best) or greedy (at worst).I OFFICIALLY ****PROTEST**** BEING CHARGED FOR THIS."

"I got the pilot episode of The Cape for free on Amazon Video on Demand. I watched it. I'll try almost anything once.Once is too much.The story is about a good cop who gets framed by the evil owner of a gigantic corporation/crime syndicate. Since he is assumed to be dead, he cannot go back to his wife or son - though, in a maudlin moment, he visits the boy while the boy is sleeping. There should have been a puppy and some kittens.At the burial service for him, the cop watches from behind a tree, about as difficult to spot as the Washington Monument in DC. Somehow, though, all the police, whom one assumes to be alert and vigilant, miss his presence.Anyway, somehow, and I really do not understand how or why, he gets involved with a circus that seems to have about six members. They seem to perform before a similar number of people. Sets are not a strong point. He performs by battling a small person (ok - dwarf) of extraordinary fighting ability and numerous tattoos.The circus is run by a large black guy whose overacting is great enough to be the converse of Keanu Reeves, if Reeves were actually trying to act. The black guy is a master magician, and he trains the ex-cop to use a cape formerly used by a now departed magician - the magic is fake, but it is allowed to seem almost real to the audience in the course of the episode. Since he used to read a comic called ""The Cape"" to his son to put him to sleep, the ex-cop assumes the identity of ""The Cape."" This might put you to sleep.The bad guy has a British accent and occasional not human eyes, and he has been committing crimes in costume, even though he is the head of a huge conglomerate. For sheer fun, one presumes. These are the crimes pinned on the ex-cop. They are designed to force ""the city"" to privatize its police force by turning it over to his corporation, which the city promptly does. Global domination to follow.The circus members are either committed to destroying the bad guy or become immediately so dedicated, and the Cape and they rob banks belonging to the corporation.The evil overlord's head henchman turns out to be the Cape's former best friend and police partner, who framed him because Mr. Evil threatened to harm his family. He is, however, not a happy henchman. In these sorts of bad movies/shows, having a family is a definite no-no.I don't know who any of the actors were, but none of them were very good, except for the little person who has some comic flair.The show is half serious and half camp/cartoon and occasionally funny. It is not a good mix, and the bad acting, silly plot and low-budget production values seal its fate. It becomes boring."
"I always like to watch movies with Judy Dench. The part she played in this film, however, didn't seem to be something I thought did justice to her acting abilities. I didn't care for Cranford so I didn't watch much of it."
First of all angelina never was hot and this mvoie needs a plot.  Totally lame done over a weekend hunk of crap shown in big theaters.  LAme lame leaaamee
"This is just a trailer... Stop putting spam in my prime, I will NEVER BUY THIS MOVIE now that you've stooped to this deceitful way of advertising."
"Folks, there are no aliens. *Nobody* saw any aliens before the 1930's. I believe Guy Ballard on Mount Shasta was the first. Why the 1930's? Why in the United States? Because of SCYFY PULP MAGAZINES, that's why. Sure, people have seen strange stuff since time immemorial, but nobody specifically saw ""aliens"" until the 1930's.Why don't the aliens tell us anything terribly important which we don't already know? When people were afraid of a thermonuclear war, the aliens warned us about...surprise...the perils of the A-bomb. Thank you. When people began to worry about environmental destruction, the aliens started to sound like Al Gore. When Barack Obama was president, a particular alien faction revealed that *he* (Obama) was an alien. Yet, during the primary elections, when Obama was just one of several candidates, the aliens were silent...And, good people, if the aliens are so damn sophisticated, WHY DO THEIR SAUCERS ALWAYS CRASH? HA HA HA.But OK, I admit that none of the above definitely *disproves* the existence of 57 breeds of aliens, visiting Terra for no better reason than mutilate some cows, drop a Bigfoot off in Pennsylvania, or make a fool out of Jimmy Carter. Planet Earth *could* be the fun house of the Galaxy.I mean, it certainly LOOKS like it! :-D"
"I love alien stories, as I love all things science fiction.This is just stupid, though. If we made a drinking game centered around the words &#34;ancient energy&#34; or &#34;gateway,&#34; this show might have some value."
"I was really disappointed in the 3 shows i watched in this series. It was totally all speculation, made up scenarios that did not even make sense. I gave it 1star only because you can learn a little about some cultures and their history somewhat. Though I did not like it, it is free with your prime account. Perhaps take a look for yourself and decide...."
"The only Horror thing about this movie is the story-line and meaningless vapid plot, that takes you no where in the slowest cadence ever struck!  I can't believe Leguzamo would agree to appear in this bomb!"
"Vanishing on 7th Street's trailer looked decent enough.  Unfortunately, that's ALL it had going for it.  I have stated many times before that the audience in ANY horror/thriller movie sometimes is asked to suspend logic, but I think ANY audience deserves a few answers--even fleeting ones.  None exist in this movie.It begins with four different main characters coming to the realization that they may be the only people left in this City because everyone else has vanished.  All that is left behind are piles of clothing.  That brought me to question one:  why did they survive?  They then spend a good amount of time stumbling and mumbling through various and sundry situations, which brings me to question 2:  was this the ONLY city that had experienced a ""vanishing""?  You are then treated to more and more scenes of utter stupidity and the constant chanting of ""I exist; I exist"" until they all start to be picked off by the ""shadow people.""  This led me to my next set of questions:  why couldn't they find some generators at a local store and have all the lights they wanted?  Why couldn't they light (and keep lit) a fire?  Why did they STAY in that City?  And last (but certainly not least) WHY DID I WASTE MY TIME?Other reviewers have hinted at this movie's potential.  I'm just not sure that it ever HAD any potential.  I didn't really care for the majority of the survivors and they all continued to make such stupid, moronic choices I was actually rooting for the shadows!Rated R for, hmmmmm, I don't know what for."
"The time I spent watching this movie that I could have spent doing something else. It actually takes real effort to make a movie this bad. First and foremost this movie is mainly about a backup generator and how long it can stay running. Apparently that's the best plot this movie has to offer. There's also a locked room (that's the sub plot) but maybe they are saving that for the next movie because no one ever bothers to find out what's behind the door.Other than than you have a bunch of people running away from shadows and looking for flashlights that work. You think that with an entire city gone they could have stopped by Radio shack and got a cart full of flashlights and batteries to haul around. Maybe even stopped by Sears and got a new generator? If all else failed the least they could do is stop at the supermarket and get some matches and lawn torches. Sadly hour main characters aren't that bright. Probably the worse survival group in this history of survival horror (I think that's what this was trying to be) *spoiler here* no wonder none of them survive.The monsters in this movie are shadows. They were creepy for about the first 5 minutes than after that just plain boring. No scares, or real sense of danger to be found in this movie. Only if your afraid of your own shadow than maybe just maybe. For some reason I remember another movie about people running around trying to find lights to keep on so they didn't vanish in the dark. I forget what it was called but it wasn't that old. That movie was a yawner as well (probably why I forgot it). I know this movie will soon ""vanish"" from my mind because there isn't anything worth remembering from it other than I need to pick up some batteries just in case the power goes out. Last time the power went out I had to bump around in the dark looking for matches and luckily I found some old birthday candles.This movie was such a waste of time it should have never been made. The characters are pointless, the movie has no plot, it never goes anywhere, it carries on to long, and nothing about what's taking place is explained. I'm all for these weird sci-fi no explanation movies but if you're going to do them at least do it right like War of the Worlds. Throw in some action, and controversy to skip over the fact that no one knows why the creatures are there or where they come from really.This movie is a fantastic waste of time! Can't imagine anyone owning or at least even bothering to watch this more than once unless they are trying to use it as a sleep aid."
"vanishing on 7th street is on of the worst movies I've forced myself to set through in YEARS........ it starts slow and strange, moves in bits & spurts and ends terrible with two young kids riding a horse to their death .............. I guess they're suppose to be the last two people on earth"
"Normally I have an appreciation for ID type television but this one just is not for me.I managed to sit through the first episode -- but only after trying to watch it three or four times.I sat through the second one -- but (I am glad) the same thoughts kept coming to me... Namely that, despite the disclaimer at the beginning, there is something ""unclean"" about this production (or just about me -- watching it). I am always left with thoughts of, ""How can the family/friends watch this when there are so many depictions of the blood of their loved ones? How would I, COULD I do it???""Furthermore, as someone who has an active imagination (and tries to be careful in what I watch/view), the style of voyeurism I pick up in watching this, is disturbing as I begin to wonder if people who DO appreciate murder, sorrow, pain, etc. (and we should not kid ourselves -- our nation is subconsciously becoming increasing enamored with killing) are lapping up the feast that (perhaps unknowingly) has been set before them.All in all, what I watched just ""feeled"" like entertainment... But who (except the weak) want to be entertained on the suffering of real people?? And what does it say about us (as individuals) if we do???So... I just can't.And I am glad."
"Trite, disrespectful. Dishonors the dead and the people involved and affected by death...including the audience. From the first minutes it's as if we were watching an episode of Desperate Housewives where murder is a joke. We all deserved to seen life treated with reverence and value.  Shame on whoever presented this disgrace, must be a sociopath. A death is not merely an inconvenience in an otherwise sunny day. The question is not, will the cop ever be able to have his anniversary dinner with his wife. The folks involved in the show should be ashamed but they must be clueless to do this."
Raw...not what I expected. I was surprised this was accessible by anyone. I am not a prude but was offended.
"Can't figure out how this show made it into seson 3. Stupid, stupid, stupid. This show deserves no more attention"
"I won't watch this or any other series from Sy Fy until they come out complete on DVD.  SyFy is unreliable.  They get you hooked and cancel.  They move their series all over on different nights and even different seasons. You will watch a few short episodes before the series will take a long break after which you will have no idea if the series is going to continue....The network was once my favorite.  Now I consider it the worst network on Television.  Other networks produce far better programming that can be called Sci Fi than the channel that once had it's name.Pathetic.So, I do not advise anyone to watch any programs produced by SyFy.  Apparently they have no way to tell who is watching their programs online and must only get their numbers from broadcast/cable numbers.  They don't have a clue and unless they undergo a radical shake up in their upper management and program direction posistions, I know more like myself who will not be bothering with this network."
"campy and often juvenile. actors are not believable. storyline is foolish and overplayed, could not get beyond a few episodes."
"I've been an avid fan of the BBC show Being Human for several years now. I love it, love the actors and acting and feel it is a great show. It was with some trepidation that I finally decided to watch the U.S. version. Needless to say I was underwhelmed. I already think it's weird and more than a little creepy that apparently there is so little original material floating around on TV and at the movies that anything that reeks of any success is snatched up and copied over and over again ad nauseum. I hate the word ""reboot"" for anything but computers and this TV show, which I dub a complete ripoff is no exception.Yes, they don't exactly copy the BBC version but there's still plenty of similar enough plot lines for me to wonder about the ethics of whoever is writing the show. Can't come up with something original? Fine, watch the U.K. version then alter the plot lines a bit, rename the characters and call it a brand-new endeavor. Riiight. And part of what I love about the U.K. version is that the people actually look like real people, men and women that I know and would actually talk to--even the pretty and handsome ones. In short, they're real people and I love that since it gives the show an added depth of reality that keeps one believing in the plot no matter how outlandish it gets. The US. version however again gives us Ken and Barbie Doll perfection with people who look like mannequins grabbed off a runway from Paris or Italy. Honestly they could slap those same characters into an episode of Beverly Hills 90210 or The OC or Dawson's Creek and no one would even notice the difference. Whereas if George, Nina, Annie, Tom or Mitchell found themselves on one of those shows the first words out their mouths would likely be, ""Bloody hell, what's all this nonsense? Do you people even know how to hoover let alone stake a vampire who's trying to kill your mates?""Where the U.K. version actually manages to say something intelligent about the human condition in all its facets and at the same time pack in some very funny, touching clever little moments the U.S. version is just another pale bloodless version of pretty people with problems--or in this case pretty supernatural people with problems. And that's never been done before now has it. (Sarcasm intended)"
Look up Bubble Guppies in Webster's and it will say &#34;See also: unwatchable...&#34;  The writers are obviously from either Colorado or Washington and too stoned to get a story together.
I thought this was a series of movies not the actual show. This was a mistake I was expecting a movie.
There are other movies you can waste your time and this one would still be a looser.  A typical end of humanity world that is based on some distant future to our own.  Gets convoluted.
"I cannot even begin to explain how bad this was, but I will try to explain.The movie began with a LONG, LONG, LONG monologue about the origin of the Nephilim species, one word &#34;Neanderthals&#34;.  A human-nephilim war breaks out (atom bomb style), and humans forget all of their advancements.  The Nephilim do not, and we worship them as Gods (with mandatory shots of Egyptian pyramids).  The Nazis rediscover all of the lost advancements, and humans are a violent and imaginative race, and we come to the attention of the nephilim again.So finally, we get a shot of fighting (space ships in the sky firing down on building with big explosions).  It looked like a cartoon with no people, but hey, this was obviously low budget.  We have a bad cast with a few more poorly done shots of the captain, the only human besides the breeder woman.  They breed.  He dies.  All humans/hybrids are dead with the exception of the pregnant breeder and her teddy bear filled with DNA, and the five pod kids we never see.  A few shots of nephilim killing.  The movie is over with a final spiel that the woman, who didn't know she was a machine, just wanted to be loved.It was so bad that I almost didn't review it."
I've really got nothing good to say but since I have to fill this space with something I'll just reiterate that I have nothing good to say about this at all. Good luck to those of you that partake.
"After viewing the amazing series, ""The Killing"" I was looking for an extended series that would have the same level of realism and intensity, the same depth of character and plot. This series was recommended and foolishly, I bought the series without watching the pilot.This is crime drama at it's worst. The characters are such stereotypes it's almost laughable. The lines predictable and delivered with all the skill of a 4th grade school play cast.There's as much grit and realism as Mr. Rodgers Neighborhood without the catchy title song. It's not as much about the money I wasted as the two hours it took me to view 1/2 hour of the pilot. The only plus is for Jennifer Beals first class mortuary make up job. She almost looks like herself......"
"I understand the existential concept of this movie. That's not the problem with it. The problem is simple, while concepually it has merit, the whole thing is so slow and boring that it was next to impossible to sit through. The film appears to have been made by people who were sleeping through it, from the mystery woman, who was stupid enough to leave her motel room door wide open while she was showering...a cruddy motel too no less to the Greek chorus watching the tire villain. The film plods along like an 18 wheeler goin through the gears. I'll never watch it again and that's for sure. It was a waste of 1.5 hours of my life."
"In a world full of ironic comedies (Repo Man, etc....)  This one was just too much.  I get it didn't care about anything beyond the entertainment, but it was not entertaining."
Thought I would pull through it but dumb got dumber with the actors and the plot. Once liked the actors now I think they had and off day or off plot
"But not good, either.  I was expecting a romantic COMEDY as the description stated, but there is nothing funny about this movie.  I guess the story line isn't too terrible, but really it's rather sad.  I would give it 0 stars, except that it's unpredictable, which is good in a romantic type movie. Other than that, I have nothing good to say about it."
"I am no longer interested in watching TV dramas that victimize women and children.  If this is the only story the producers have to tell, I'm not going to give it a good rating."
"There is practically nothing I could add to the other 1 star reviews - other people already said every single word I wanted to say about this show.In short, not to waste somebody's else time like mine was wasted by those series: awfully slow, boring, a really dumb set of characters, truly inept plot twists.I watched with my finger on the fastforward button for the second half of the 1 season - does not look I missed anything considering that nothing happens for about 75% of the time.The pilot was good and I had such hopes for that show.. well, those went the way of many hopes. Total waste of time, these series."
"I'd like to say that this TV series had something going for it other than Mireille Enos' winning smile, a nice sound track, and some pretty good photography. But those three qualities could not compensate for the astonishingly bad script, the relentless over-acting, and producers who had no idea where they were. This was Seattle, for godssake - not LA, not Chicago, not Philly - SEATTLE.The plot was stolen from Twin Peaks. There is a murder, and in the course of solving it the sordid underbelly of the entire town - its intrigues, its nasty secrets, its dirty laundry - is revealed. But unlike Twin Peaks, which had a sense of humor, The Killing takes itself seriously ... which was a mistake. (I confess I did laugh at times, but it wasn't a jolly laugh.) You just can't have that much stupidity on screen without making your story ludicrous.And, boy, was this show ludicrous. Here are some highlights: cops run a plate but don't know that the vehicle has been reported stolen, to interview a bus driver, cops have to get on a bus and ride around on it all day (Hello? The employer is the city, which has employee records), a former hit man for the Polish mafia has no police records because it was ""a long time ago"" (like before the printing press was invented), the hit man takes revenge for his daughter's murder based on a positive ID of his daughter's shirt made by his incredibly, incredibly stupid wife, and so it goes, on and on, stupidity after stupidity. And to make up for the fact that the writing was abysmal (what white guy ever refers to another white person as having a skinny ""white ass"") they stuffed each episode with so many red herrings you could smell them all the way to Denmark.At this point, I simply cannot bear to watch any more. My son said he couldn't make it past the pilot. I should have listened to him."
"It is riddled with detail. It was  hard to seperate the wheat from the chaff; intrigue that added up to a crime from chaff.  Naturally since this drama cannot focus, neither does it have any pace."
"If you're looking to watch a action packed, thriller/mystery, this is not the show for you. The story line in this series is painfully slow and lacks the intrigue of most new shows of similar genre. If you do attempt to push through a show or two be fully prepared for the over the top characterization of the main detective and her new to homicide partner. It's a cliche show with little to no creativity.I'll usually make it through a full episode or two with little to no distraction, but found myself doing other things around the house while it was playing in the background. This show's truly not worth your time."
"This movie was just a live-action cartoon that carried no real sense of peril or logic.  I guess it was sort of fun, in a way, and Hauer is always worth watching.  However, I just found the film to be like many movies that ape the glory days of grindhouse:  these new grindhouse films are more like caricatures of the real thing.  They lack charm, cohesion, and restraint.  I own this movie, it was fun in a shallow, forget-it-ten-seconds-after-it's-over kind of a way, but I really can't recommend it as good cinema."
"during the reformation, the great schism ignited by martin luther between roman catholicism and the new protestantism of the north, luther compared rome to sodom, and scaled sodom as the runner up...the war that ensued included every atrocity that could be imagined, such as the impaling of individuals on sharpened tree limbs, roasting them over a slow fire, and slashing open the bellies of pregnant women and flinging their unborn children to ravenous dogs...in other words, it was a fairly ordinary war...but i have little taste for such spectacles, and i find it difficult to believe that an actor of rutger's stature would immerse himself to the ears in a slasher movie that attempts, however futilely, to outrevulse all contenders...at least the trailer gives fair warning, but the high rating it is accorded by critics who have damned to near death films of real quality, with tedious cavils and faint praises, is entirely outrageous."
"I understand what they were going for, and I enjoy 70's/80's grindhouse stuff, but this isn't it.. Okay, it's a world gone wild, in all places, Halifax, Nova Scotia?? (renamed scum town). My mother would be turning over in her grave. The scenes make absolutely no sense and the extras all seem to know they're extras, because they can't act, especially the ones where the moms are with their kids; it looked like were out shopping on a Saturday and were instantly begged to be in the movie.. The two sadistic brothers were as intimidating as Corey Haim and Corey Feldman... This movie isn't fun, campy or witty, it's sadistic, low budget and completely pointless. I've seen a lot of bad movies, and most of them were Troma films, but I doubt even they would produce something this horrible."
"Non-existent budget, bad acting in a bad way even for this type of movie - I have seen the grindhouse-type movies before and liked them - this was just plain not worth the $, don't even bother renting it."
"I ignored all the over the top cheesy scenes and horrible horrible acting-but when they torched a bus of children- I had to quit.why are movies like this even made. a complete waste-wasn't fun, funny, entertaining or interesting.just total wothless junk."
"This had to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I love Rutger Hauer, but even his talent is wasted in this totally stupid obnoxious gore fest. I love grindhouse cinema and I love really crazy twisted films, but this one simply left a bad taste in my mouth. I have totally hated every comical and silly troma film I have ever seen, and this film is very much like troma movies. Yet there were some interesting ideas in this film that I sometimes did like. But it got so rediculous and hokey that I simply couldn't take it anymore. The movie is just a totally wierd ride that felt sci-fi. Sort of like Mad Max meets Japanese extreme novies. I don't agree with other who thought it was better than Planet Terror. That movie just seemed to have this classic grindhouse feel to it, while this one just felt cheap and totally silly. I gave this two stars simply because Rutger Hauer deserves some respect for having the balls to even dare to be in this sorry mess of a film."
not worth your time...were Kennedys so absorbed and lack faithfulness as portrayed. Shame on the Kennedy men! Poor acting. Couldn't get past the first episode
"I was very disappointed in this production; I suppose there are only so many ways to bring to film the events and tragedies of the Kennedy family, before it becomes simply a rehashing of commonly known facts. This in no way compares to the 1983 NBC Miniseries ""The Kennedy's"", for one's money that is DVD to purchase."
"Originally contracted for a cable network, it contained such massive inaccuracies that the network wouldn't show it. Seriously, though, Katie Holmes as Jackie Kennedy Onassis? Greg Kinnear as JFK? I like Kinnear, he does good light comedy, but that's not what's called for here. Don't waste your time unless your ideology needs support."
"I seriously do not mean to offend anybody who enjoys this cartoon, or anybody responsible for its production. That is the last sort of thing that I would intend to do. I grew up watching SpongeBob SquarePants cartoons, and I was so familiar with the few episodes that were around back at that time that I was able to follow along with the dialogue contained within them. These episodes can still be quite funny, but they are lacking in the charm that helped to achieve spectacular fame for the series and a remarkable fan base. This is not the SpongeBob I remember. Buy the earliest seasons. SpongeBob SquarePants just isn't as loveable as it used to be."
"I truly enjoyed the Cheech and Chong movies but, find most that try to use marijuana as the focus fall extremely short of the target. This series does just that, fell short at the starting line..."
Only watched a small part of the show but the dialog and content was not the kind that I was interested in.
"Dumbest series, not funny, cute or smart. Why watch such losers? This isn't Amazon's fault; it's the producer's of this lame show."
The people on &#34;reality&#34; tv are fake and they encourage our youth to laziness and an inability to use their intelligence for anything but staring dumbly at the television. &#8203;
"Petty fights and arguments all season long. Karen stinks doesn't add any relevancy, just high school drama. Her dad was a mobster not her, no one is afraid of Karen. She's delusional."
"This might be the worst reality TV I've ever seen! I don't know exactly what I expected, but so much of the dialogue (if you can call it that) was dubbed, it was pitiful."
Do not bother with the HD episodes of this season if you're watching on a TiVo.  They play with a choppy stutter framerate that is terribly annoying to watch.  The low-def versions are fine.
NO ONE smiles in this series...at least not the first couple of episodes.We could only watch two episodes...just too excruciatingly boring and grinding.
I  rated it  one star  only because the  review  requested  it. It started  with  great  promise  but  the  ending  stank.
"The file is damaged or something, plays a few minute and then locks up.  How do we complain about this?"
"Positives:Getting people to act as if they're not acting but just being themselves is harder than it looks. If you don't like reading, exercising, or contributing to world peace/health and therefore need to fill time then this flick will do it.Negatives:The most creative parts of the movie were the Norwegian mountains which, unfortunately for the Norwegian production crew, they can't take any credit for creating. They can take credit for copycat, anyone can do it, wobbly handheld mockumentary in the long line of Blair etc. redux. The computer generated trolls were pretty standard for today's computer graphics software so if you find them amazing then you must just now be discovering technology. By the way, a note to the educated viewer, it's anatomically impossible to have a creature of that size with that particular skeletal structure (e.g. blood flow pressure; stress forces on bone)."
"An original concept is sabotaged by the never-ending mockumentary trend in horror movies.  This dubbed Norwegian entry is becoming a cult favorite and I frankly can't understand its appeal.  It's not really funny nor scary.  The troll effects are okay, and there's a certain ingenuity in the various troll appearances.  But the movie is incredibly slow and the jerky camera work is nauseating.  The script is mundane at least in the dialogue department and the ending way too abrupt, not that I was sorry to see it end.I'll be glad when the lost tapes fad fades and movie-makers rely on story and skill instead of tired gimmicks."
I watched this movie based on the four and a half stars...  The reviewers must have all been Norwegian family members of the film maker.  This plot is so tired and the effects were so bad give me a break.  No one on a film shot can figure out how to use night vision at night??  It's just stupid...the movie is stupid...and I feel stupid for wasting my time watching it...
"Yes, 9/11 was horrific and for those of us who were not there I'm sure we can't imagine. I began watching this on 9/11/13 just to remember what had happened, part of the way thru I had to turn it off because the descriptions and so forth were so terribly graphic that it was disturbing. Don't watch this movie if you are sensitive to very graphic descriptions of the horrors of that day."
"After watching a different (and better) version of this play, I was excited to see additional episodes listed on Amazon.  I watched about 10 minutes of this Season 3 and was very disappointed.  I was hoping this was a continuation of the TV series seen on Amazon.  What I saw previously on Amazon were two series of a television show.  This version of the show is a series of plays.  It is not the same at all.  This is just my taste.  If you love plays, then you will probably like this.  There are many more season on this version.  The TV version, sadly, only has two season.Both versions are available on Amazon online free of charge."
"I'm 26 but I still enjoy a lot of the teen drama shows. Vampire diaries, PLL, al or of shows on The CW. But this show is awful. It has an interesting plot but the acting is beyond bad. The only decent character is Stiles."
"I'll just quote my review of season three:&#34;I'm a spy movie fan and I'd like to go with the fantasy, but it's just too contrived. It's so predictable that it's not much fun.&#34;I jumped to season 3 without watching much of 2 or 1 thinking that if it's been renewed for that many seasons, it must be getting better. Right? Wrong. Slightly, ever so slightly, more polished. The writing is very amateurish."
I did not appreciate the language. right from the start they were taking the Lord's name in every sentence it seemed. We might have watch maybe 5 minutes of it. That was more than we cared for!
It started off ok and then it became silly and predictable so my husband I decided not to continue watching it.  The acting was ok but the story line well you can figure it out right away.
This show is complete nonsense. Children should not be treated in this manner. This is a poorly produced reality show.
"The children are spoiled rotten and the parents should have the kids taken away from them just because of teaching children the worst values on the planet. Please tell me how parents can spend 2 or 3 THOUSAND dollars on a $100.00 dress 24 inches in length for gods sake, and parade a kid that has no idea where she's even at half the time, just to get a dumb cheap crown or banner??? How is this possible????Do these people have any brains at all?? Yeah...lets not spend any money on education for them or save for college as they don't even seem to be able to speak properly....let's spend $10,000.00 on a pageant to win $300.00 worth of trashy junk so the mother can live her life through the child.All I can do is watch a few minutes and shake my head in disgust and dis-belief, and change channels, even though my child wanted to see it, I convinced her it was so ridiculous, and these were all fools that make money off these moron parents and it was a waste of time.If you would have told me this kind of thing existed in this form I would have said no...nope...no.....no one could be this gullable and stupid, but no matter how foolish and stupid you think people can get....we seem to always set new records in this country as it continues to decline everyday.Just terrible program."
"I'm speechless and horrified.  All I can say is Thank God this world is very far away from my world.  I feel sad for anyone who would want to subject themselves and their child to this craziness.  But then again, if they are involved in this crazy sub-culture they must be certifiable themselves."
"The film says, ""75% of people believe in the supernatural."" Do you know what that says about 75% of people? They're MORONS!What is the NUMBER ONE thing you NEVER see in ALL this ""ghost, these, and ghost that"" shows...HMMMM? Anybody?GHOSTS!"
This series seems to be primarily a romance series with a little police procedural thrown in. And romance between co-workers?  That's a situation so ripe for disaster I could not stomach the thought of enduring more.
"This show isn't what it used to be, but having said that, each week tends to be mildly amusing as the A-Team of this new millenium goes about righting wrongs and having some fun.What's annoying is that for a long time now, NONE of the plots even pretend to have any meaningful obstacles... countless systems are bypassed with the flick of the wrist and a punch of the keyboard's Enter key... villains are hoodwinked, authorities remain clueless, foes are outsmarted etc. This used to be a smart, sassy show but any similarity to the UK's ""Hustle"" has long since been bypassed... what we seem to have nowadays is a team of people who effortlessly con everyone, walk away smiling every time... and if the episode can get away with sticking to one location (ie. cheap for the Production) then so be it... at most everyone dons a disguise or change of wardrobe. Ugh.Episode 4.12 ""The Office Job"" however has to go down in the history books as *the* most tedious and boring example of a premise s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d beyond breaking point and well into SNAP territory. I actually believed the producers had lost their minds with this one..."
"Ok, i took dance class for years as a kid and young adult and I havenever, never, ever had a teacher like that.. It is so unprofessional not to mentionterrible workouts and dance advice I can't believe that these women subject theirkids to it..they need to get out more and see what a professional dance school islike in the real world..This woman has no class at all and one of the major thingstaught at real dance schools is class, professional manners and respect.  I wouldnever respect a teacher that talked to me like that because real dance instructorsdo not talk to their students like that nor do dance parents hang around like that.These women are nuts to subject their kids to this woman.  If I could have given it a zero I would have."
"This is another example of terrible, awful mothers that will do ANYTHING for two minutes of fame, even sacrificing their children in the process. Often times guilty of out right child abuse, these looser's are so desperate for fame, they even allow the human blimp named ""Abby"" to abuse everyone, in every show without ever thinking of anything close to love or pride or protecting those beautiful, talented, wonderful young girls that give so much trying to please everyone else. The same people that get out of the car at accidents to view the carnage, are the same ones that watch this god awful, disgusting program that clearly demonstrates just how low parents can sink for cash or fame.Just AWFUL."
"The dance instructor (I'll call her Bertha) is a sadist of the first order. I cant tell who she enjoys torturing more, the kids or the mothers. The mothers who allow their daughters to be subjected to this abuse need mental health counseling, as well as some parenting skills classes. I'd be willing to bet they started out in the Tiara wearing preschooler and baby contests. I wouldn't quite call it kiddie porn but with the stripper make-up dance routines and costumes its real close."
"Thought this might be entertaining and funny but it was just a too realistic view of people solely focused on themselves and the awful, hurtful behavior that goes along with those types of priorities. We found it rather depressing to watch, not at all humorous, more head shaking in disbelief that this was actually a show."
"Pretty much like a car crash in slow motion. Wrong on so many levels. The cultural value of cheesecake icecream shakes. Seriously? I'm watching this? I hate myself, and I need to go read a book. Sigh. :/"
Not up to the caliber of most well done British mysteries.  We tried to watch it but it did not hold our attention.
"I just can't get by the various English accents in this drama set in Italy, with supposedly Italian characters. And why, if all the men have British accents, do all the women have Italian???"
"I did not review this product. This product was presented to me as a download, and I wanted a DVD. So it was deleted from my purchase list. Thank you."
"If you have a smidgen of intelligence this movie will be sure to insult it.  The stupidest characters + a stupid script = a complete waste of time.  [And I'm an Ashley Judd fan but I sure wouldn't buy her facial products based on how she looked through this movie.]Yes, there IS a little bit of a surprise at the end of the movie that will make some idiots think this was a real ""smart"" movie - but they'd be wrong, and getting to that surprise end is just soooo NOT WORTH IT."
Not appropriate to watch. Guess I am naive but this should be rated 'R' for graphic scenes and language. Can't believe parents would say these kinds of things to their children. I do not recommend this to anyone.
"Plot is shallow, did not fimd this show to be enjoyable. The show is only 30 minutes long for the price of a hour long show."
"Figured I watch the pilot and check out the movie...what a joke.  If folks think censoring is appropriate, why bother having the lines in the first place?  This movie is not some G rated Disney film so why is it getting bleeped constantly?  Just plain stupid.Thankfully with this preview I can avoid the series and look for some other adult rated movies who do not censor their content."
terrible is about all I can say.
"Although I believe we may have been visited in the past, the so called &#34;experts&#34; have no credentials. I mean one is a boxing promoter or some such? The leaps of fancy parading as facts is astounding. &#34;See that round rock? Ancient Alien theorists believe this was a stone placed here by Aliens and was used for their giant pool tables!&#34;"
Low Low Budget stinker. The special effects are terrible. The acting is ridiculous. The story is boring. I loved Nude Nuns With Big Guns but this movie is not even in the same league as Nude Nuns. Done waste your money.
"I can not believe that the 2 chicks in this movie are responsible for writing and directing .. American Mary .... That was a good movie ... This is just a waste of $$ and time which u can't get back when it's gone . I warn anyone expecting somthing from this very low i mean low budget flick , bad acting , bad story , not funny at all , and the gore is laughable . STAY AWAY from this sticker!!!!!"
"I saw the title and thought that this has got to be a well constructed satire on so-called  ""exploitation"" films (a deceptive name to make cheap seem respectable) or it's really a cheaply conceived and produced movie.The old storyline of a dead body suddenly showing up and some innocent people make a series of dumb decisions (so a movie can be made and an audience can say ""Dumb decision!"". Briefly, two sisters, a girlfriend and some religious guy drive around with a dead body in the trunk trying to dispose of the body while avoiding the usual drug gangsta and true killer. His scenes add up to about 5 minutes and thankfully because his acting consists of wearing a hoodie.If you like dumb dialogue, poor acting and lots of scenes of an old car and a couple of rooms then this low budget movie is for you."
"Honestly here guys, overall this things getting 4 stars with an overall of 33 votes so far? Come on, who are you kidding? Every other site slams this movie with honest reviews, IMDB has this as 4 of 10 stars with 673 votes. Put two and two together here folks. You saw the trailer right? If not, go see it, and you will know this movie is going to be horrible just from watching that. Horrible acting, bad editing, dodgy sound, ugly lead actresses, dumb plot, and made by two girls no one I know has ever heard of. What where they popular on a public access show they produced in a town that all 32 residents living their watched it? So why is there reviews here praising how much they love them? Sounds to me like one of the following possibilities.1 - One or both of the twins wrote a review or two here.2 - Some pervert just heard it was female twins and went nuts obsessing over it.3 - Friends of friends of friends... you know, ""like my movie on facebook guys!!!""4 - It's just a bunch of jokers having a stupid laugh.5 - Drunk or mental conditions apply to the reviewer.6 - Watched the wrong movie.Add a 7 if you have any more thoughts :D"
"very easy to delete any worthwhile comments about this good-for-nothing presentation of an egotist and ensemble, in mundane predictable skits."
Can't think of one good thing to say about this production.  Unless it we snore fest.  As sad waste of time.  Do not bother.
"I am just not a fan of ""iCarly."" The gags are often focused on mildly humorous words or phrases used by some characters and often they are brought up several different times throughout the course of one scene or episode, or sometimes certain words that sound laughable are botched into nonsensical but bland phrases or are broken up and rearranged for humor. It just comes off as hokey and sometimes the jokes are something that I would usually expect out of a corny 1970s situation comedy. True, there have been a few jokes that have left me laughing uncontrollably, but they seldom appear and there have been times before where I have found it odd that I was not laughing at the kind of little jokes that normally are my sense of humor. Many people may believe that I am expecting too much of more recent television series to try and hold a candle to the quality of Nickelodeon programs that were broadcast during the 1990s and early 2000s, but I long for the nostalgia I feel when looking back on faint memories of those series. I sincerely apologize, Nickelodeon. I just miss your older series and wish that you could bring them back somehow."
"After cannibalizing nearly all of TOS series, they ran out of ideas. This one is so, so lame.Their fantasy of Trip-the George Bush-ish NASCAR like mechanic-that beds an exotic beautiful woman and has an immaculate conception. Whose twisted fantasy is this. Lol. And then of course it is back to the evil man and his evil machine to kill all other races, echoing the Nazis in the first episode of this year's shows. This is new? This show is so full of mish-mash tripe that I am so glad there are no more. This last season was certainly painful to watch. I did enjoy most of season three however, and the overriding story arch with the unusual harshness of the decisions Captain Archer has to make, making it a truly deep emotional engaging show. The first three seasons were good overall and this one is a plane going down in a ball of flames. This next to last episode is the crash with the fireball."
Terrible. If you like bad jokes and bad language then you will like it. But I didn't like it at all.
Not understanding why they are selling a season pass to a show that they do not have rights to show to you. Why am I getting charged for the new episode when I can't even watch it?
"The storyline is slow with many action scenes being simply unbelievable.  I cannot recommend anyone watch this show, which is sad because the show concept could be very fun."
"This program is really sick. You shouldn't laugh at or exploit a show that is full of people getting injured. It also should have been rated R for language and violence. I can't believe that MTV would put such a program on that is watched and revered by young adults.Even though they say don't try this at home, impressionable young people would try these stunts and sub stain every lasting injuries. This program is trash in my opinion. MTV for creating this series should be ashamed of themselves for profiting from others pain. I fell that the companies who sponsored this program should hang their heads in shame also............."
"One of my favorite random ""30 Rock"" gags of recent vintage is that the show-within-the-show only got on the air as NBC's way of apologizing for having aired ""Bitch Hunter,"" a misogynist action drama starring Will Ferrell as a hero who barks out dialogue like, ""Put the mimosas down, bitch!"" Each time we'd see a clip of ""Bitch Hunter,"" it would come with a credit listing the various writers and producers, which included eccentric former NBC president Ben Silverman, ""Mad Men"" creator Matthew Weiner and ""30 Rock"" writer Jack Burditt.At the time, I just took it as a friendly dig at one of the series' own writers. But having watched two episodes of ""Last Man Standing"", the Burditt-created sitcom in which Tim Allen plays a sexist, homophobic, xenophobic sporting goods executive, I had the following thoughts:1)Allen's character would probably be right in the ""Bitch Hunter"" target demo;2)""Last Man Standing"" is Burditt participating in an elaborate practical joke to see how much of that ethos he can put into a network sitcom; or3)That ""30 Rock"" kept associating ""Bitch Hunter"" with Burditt was less a friendly joke than a veiled cry for help.Allen's Mike Baxter has a cliched sitcom wife - always rolling her eyes at his foolishness but ultimately going along - named Vanessa, a trio of daughters and a job at Outdoor Man, a sporting goods company defined for so long by Mike's real baby: a catalog featuring photos of outdoor men doing manly outdoor things in exotic locales. But as boss Ed points out, not enough people read catalogs anymore, so Mike's globe-trotting lifestyle gets grounded while he tries to fix the company's terrible website - and so he can realize how much his girls need a man around the house.The youngest of them is played by Kaitlyn Dever, who was so incredible last season as the orphaned Loretta on ""Justified."" I know work is work, but it's  disheartening to see her here.Mike's a guy's guy who has no idea what ""Glee"" or the Harry Potter books are, is happy to be at the office because, quote, ""it smells like balls in here,"" and seems convinced that his family in particular and the world in general are going to hell in a hand basket because there aren't enough real men anymore.""Men used to build cities just so we could burn them down!"" he rants during a webcast that unexpectedly turns into a viral sensation. ""You can't even change a tire! A tire! Why don't you get off the couch, you moron, and go outside!?!?""Other jokes involve Mike being uncomfortable about other cultures, gay people and immigrants, among others.Allen played a similar character on ""Home Improvement,"" and while I was never a big fan of that show, I don't remember Tim Taylor ever being this abrasive. I didn't like Tim Taylor, but I didn't instantly hate him the way I do within 90 seconds or so of being with Mike Baxter.And there's humor to be mined from a prejudiced and/or reactionary character. See Archie Bunker, most famously, or Stacy Keach on ""Titus,"" or even much of what Burditt and company had Jack Donaghy say and do on ""30 Rock."" But those shows told those jokes with more style, and usually had an awareness of the ludicrous and/or offensive nature of those characters' words and deeds. ""Last Man Standing"" doesn't.Allen's a comedy professional, beloved sitcom star and the voice of Buzz Lightyear. These are all things that would lead me to assume that the studio audience - a species that tends to be generous with their laughter, anyway, by virtue of being physically present and encouraged by the warm-up guy - would enthusiastically respond to all of these groaners. Yet the episodes ABC made so far were clearly done before the laugh track was sweetened - a common industry practice where the studio audience's laughter is augmented with pre-recorded laughs from older sitcoms - and you can hear crickets most of the time.""Last Man Standing"" is the first of three new ABC comedies in which men struggle with what it means to be men in a world dominated by women. Each of them - ""Man Up!"" and ""Work It"" are the others - are terrible in their own way, but given the presence of Burditt behind the camera, and Allen in front of it, the cringe-inducing badness of this one feels the most frustrating.Unless, again, the whole thing is a very expensive, well-disguised prank."
I have delayed writing this review to let my pique cool somewhat. Flashpoint is a Canadian production which makes no attempt to disguise the fact that it is shot in Toronto.Season 4 has 18 episodes but the three disks in this set marketed on Amazon.com in the US has only 13 episodes 6 of which are repeats from Season 3. This means the buyer is being cheated out of 11 of the 18 episodes. Calling this the Complete Season 4 is dishonest and frankly a rip-off.I'd like a refund and I would encourage anyone really interested to attempt to obtain the Canadian Version which actually has the complete set.
"How can a season be released and not be complete!!!That's what happened here and I felt disappointed. This show was quite original and intriguing and to not know of the last episodes (besides downloading them), it is very bad!"
this is the most idiotic thing ever to be recorded. Loads of fake drama by a bunch of fools that have no business being on TV. This is definitely for the lowest common denominator (2 year-olds). Where do they get these people. The most common phrase from this show is &#34;come on! come on!&#34; OOH the intensity of all.
"I am a big NCIS fan.  Excuse me, I WAS a big NCIS fan.  I have seasons 1 through 7 on DVD.  I may have season 8 also, but I can't find it at the moment.  Starting in season 6 I noticed a falling off in the quality of the show; the writing just didn't seem as good.  Now with season 9 on DVD I see a huge falling off in picture quality as well.  The DVD picture quality is blurry, and in no way compares with the sharpness of the earlier seasons on DVD.  What?  Are they trying to get me to upgrade to Blu-Ray by deliberately selling me inferior DVDs?Between the inferior picture quality, and the sub-par writing, I'm sorry, NCIS has lost me as a fan.  @hg47"
"out of the two episodes I bought of NCIS:LA this one would not play correctly.  I have had that happen only once before (Machine Gun Minister), and it was blamed on my internet connect.  Unfortunately, that is not what I have come to find out.  For I have watched many of the programs that I have bought back to back and out of all of them this and another were the only two I encountered problems with.  So no I could not rate this a success because of the reloading and reloading I have encountered all three times I tried to watch it. I have bought two seasons all have worked fine, then two episodes and only one works fine.  Two movies and only one worked fine too. So I am not happy with those two instances.  I have tried to play the NCIS:LA Episode three times each time with the same results. So in some instances I think the streaming is very erratic. I do not have this problem when watching Netflix."
"I own BLUE BLOODS Season One on DVD.  The drama is interesting.  It's a decent cop show.  And I like Tom Selleck.  What pisses me off with BLUE BLOODS Season Two is the blurry picture quality.  My one star review is a response to the inferior video quality of Season Two compared to Season One on DVD.  Apparently CBS wants me to give up on the DVD format and convert to Blu-Ray, and is deliberately delivering DVDs to consumers with flawed video.The drama, the acting and the writing seems as good as last season, but the picture quality is so poor I'm not sure I will bother to watch the whole season.One good thing I can say is that the picture quality for NCIS Season Nine was slightly worse on DVD than BLUE BLOODS Season Two.  Maybe TV studios don't care about viewers watching on the DVD format, and just want it to die already.  Well, NCIS is dead to me.  And if BLUE BLOODS doesn't get their video act together they will be dead to me too.@hg47"
"If you want to watch CSI Miami, season 10, I recommend you avoid the DVD version and upgrade to Blu-Ray now as the TV studios obviously want.  The picture quality of TV on DVD is on a downward slide for many series.  The TV studios are deliberately shipping DVD discs with inferior video to kill the format and to make Blu-Ray look better than it is.  Here, the DVDs are so blurry I can't watch them.  I CAN'T SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING!  I own most, possibly all seasons of CSI Miami on DVD; the early seasons are fine, 10 is a visual mess.SEA HUNT Season One on DVD 1958 *underwater* has sharper picture quality than CSI MIAMI Season Ten DVDs.  I'm not joking: if you don't believe me, check it for yourself!  CBS wants us on Blu-Ray.I have yet up upgrade my viewing to Blu-Ray; but there may also be another factor at play.  Remember first generation STAR TREK, where the close-up shots of the sexy female guest star would be shot through a lens that made her look sexier by blur?  David Caruso would look like a wrinkled grandfather if Blu-Ray did a high-resolution close-up on his face; and Emily Procter is also getting up there in years.  I suspect a state-of-the-art optical lens during shooting supplies just the right blur for the Blu-Ray discs to obscure the age of the stars, knocking the actual viewing experience back down into the DVD realm; but the studio can't ship the exact same viewing experience on both DVD and Blu-Ray discs, so the studio adds an additional digital blur to the DVD discs.Can you say, time for a Class Action Suit?@hg47"
"Ok , so all the CSI sresies have wooden acting , dumb plots and poor writing . However this is even worse because of David Carusos lame overacting . Watching him take his sunglasses on and off and his pathetically delivered jokes at the crime scene are sadly funnier than most comedies ."
"Like most of the comments say,there is no substance,just eye candy.Like my parents used to say,if you want to watch something,watch a show where you can learn something from/that has a moral story.Most shows these days are glorifying pre-marital sex.In the real world,there are kids having kids,different daddies.But to each her own."
"This show starts with a bratty, impolite and grating northerner coming to a southern town to be a doctor.  It shows us (southerners) as hoop-wearing idiots with gators for pets.  It stereotypically degrades southerners as nit-wits and incompetents.  I could not stomach this show--if I were from south Alabama, I would be tempted to sue the network for their portrayal.  Silly show (although I do have a gator in my pond but he is NOT a pet; now that would be silly)."
"real unique -- lead female wears spike heels (women are grotesque to look at unless dressed 4 men, say the network execs) -- that's real different, a female lead in spike heels.  u know what else is different?  the hair.  real different.  longish (women's hair should flirt with breasts, say the network execs).  and eye makeup.  lots and lots and lots and lots of it (womens eyes ugly w/out pound per eye of makeup, say the network execs).but wait, get to the unique part u say!ok -- unique part -- a woman goes to a town where she feels (at first) superior and says clever superior things.  how unique is that! (suburgatory isn't that clever and superior.)and wait, there's more ...there's the boy ... oh, he's SO unique."
"Amazon Prime apparently only includes the first episode, so I'm only rating the first episode.Despite the intriguing title of this series, it is laced with inaccuracies and pseudoscience, backed by testimonials that are little more than rumors."
These are worst bunch of goobers on TV. Brad stays home and proves Mount Rushmore is a racist plot and Lincoln was gay. The minions stumble around the country to try to prove his inane theories.
Great set of players but the introduction of former &#34;stars&#34; tainted it greatly. Boston Rob showed the world what true lies and deceit can do. This made me see the show no longer as a game but as real life played out.
"***SPOILER ALERTS***What starts out semi-promising as a young man inherits his grandmothers luxurious apartment, he is being video-blogged by some hot chick on the street. He basically dismisses her and requests not to be videoed. He moves into his place and strange things slowly happen. He starts to get suspicious that people are out to get him and basically oust him from the apartment, either because they feel it is wrongfully his or some other reason. He makes noises and disrupts the other tenants in the building, constantly challenging him to quiet down. The chick he met on the street, for whatever reason she felt she needed to see him again, finds her way to the apartment. He lets her and have a wonderful dinner and commence whatever relationship with some nighttime love session. She gets up in the middle of the night to video tape his apartment and all the things in it. Then, what we dont see, she gets assaulted somehow. What was it? A ghost? Another person? We dont know what happens to her.Our mild-mannered tenant wakes up without really wondering what happened to her (or so it seemed). The whole ""who is there"" premise escalates to the level of paranoia as he traps himself in his apartment with handmade weapons and booby traps of his own making. He has like 12 days to establish himself as the official owner of the apartment and it took a matter of 12 days to become completely insane. Not sure that is likely, but that is what we have here. In the end, he is ultimately undone by his own boobytraps and dies by a wall of nails impaled upon himself.The epilogue: a small boy finds a laptop. Certainly, when we open anyone's laptop we go right to the incriminating videos. Right? Happens all the time. So this little boy is watching and we see the previous tenant dragging the body of the chick, apparently he killed. And this is done all spooky like with chopped up frames and blurred motion, because hi-def video cameras on today's market for some reason are able to do that kind of thing. Which begs the question - is he a ghost or is it just done for effect? Probably the latter. Anyway, as he approaches closer to the camera, he turns to it and then does something that looks like he is attacking the camera. What?!? Why is he assaulting the camera?Anyway. Stupid film."
"Like many other long time X-Fans, I'm afraid I found this one an immense disappointment. I know it's easy to fall into hyperbole, but in all honesty, this may well be the single most boring cartoon I've ever seen.On the plus side, on a purely technical level the animation is superb. About as subtle as a tattoo of a flaming skull, but technically superb. Oh, and almost all of the chicks are drawn with giant racks, too. And when I say ""giant"", I really do mean giant. The kind that in the real world could only be achieved with truly industrial quantities of silicone.Actually, aside from the fact that everyone keeps their clothes on, the style of animation here is very much in the mould of high-budget R-rated anime. I'm not just talking about the spandex-clad chests - there's also the splatter and the gore. Measured purely in terms of screen time, the amount of violence in this show is probably about the same as you'd find in any other superhero cartoon. However, the feel and the texture of that violence is very different from what many viewers will be used to. There's something positively gratuitous about the way it's drawn. Indeed, it could almost be described as erotic... If that's your thing.And yet, despite all the violence and the chicks with the giant racks, the truth is that this has to be one of the most profoundly boring pieces of television I've ever seen. The problem is... Well, let me explain with a story.I remember back when I was about seven years old and I thought Star Wars was the greatest movie ever made. I also thought that because the best parts of Star Wars were the space battles, wouldn't Star Wars be even better if it was just one long space battle?Of course, I now know that it simply doesn't work that way. However technically impressive, however visually awe-inspiring, those climactic battles only mean something when we're emotionally invested in the characters. If we fundamentally just don't care about Luke Skywalker or the world he inhabits, we also won't care that much when - or indeed if - he blows up the Death Star. The special effects are reduced to being _just_ special effects. An impressive technical achievement to be sure, but nothing more than that.Unfortunately, that's the way it is with this show.In this series, in place of real character development all we get are emotional histrionics. In place of real storytelling, scenes of gratuitous violence are interspersed with lengthy and turgid exposition. And in those very rare, brief moments when things aren't gratuitously violent, histrionic, or even turgid, everyone suddenly becomes inanely bright and cheery for no apparent reason.The honest truth is that at no point did I find myself caring about the characters in this story even the tiniest little bit. The animators could have drawn us an episode in which every single one was fed slowly into a meat-grinder and it'd barely have rated a yawn.Frankly, I would just have found it as unutterably boring as every other episode in the series.Theo."
Great Cop show. NO SDH.. NO CC. For the hard of hearing... When Shout takes over. 90% of the time theyleave out the CC are SDH... Just cheap..And the people that have seasons 1-4 that have CC & SDH on them. Are now out of luck...From season 5 on..Thanks to cheap Shout..
"Early Bret Easton Ellis novels and their subsequent film adaptations were famous for portrayals of disaffected youth doing naughty things and contemplating life. Now, imagine a handful of characters in their forties doing the same thing, and you've got I Melt With You. Rob Lowe, Jeremy Piven, Thomas Jane, and Christian McKay are old college buddies who meet up annually at Big Sur to celebrate a birthday, but with their own families and hidden secrets plaguing them, they embark on a week of drugs and parties until a tragedy forces them to face their past. Steer clear of I Melt With You, the film's laughable script and ludicrous plot points do nothing to help the actors trying so desperately to make something of the material."
"This is actually a painful movie to watch and although the Richard character is truly disturbing ifnot despicable, the others are pretty well not worth watching at all.  There is so much drug and alcoholuse that the humanity is erased from the film.  Awful.  Do not bother unless you yourself are part ofthis drug culture that's being portrayed."
"Is it original? Yeah. Is it poorly done? Yes, definitely. Very bad show. It's hard to care about any of the characters. The actors are just there for a paycheck. If you're a dullard, you'll think this is a great show. If you've seen better, forget it."
Is this show about nature or about man involving himself in nature. In episode 1 a terrible narrator who talks way too much throughout the documentary speaks for 15 minutes about how he is within 15 meters of the eagle and the eagle is staring at him. Episode 2 is about a lonely man that raises a dozen wild turkeys from birth. You never actually learn anything except that the man is sad when he loses his turkeys. This show seems more about the people filming them than about nature.
"For some writer's block reason a skilled pickpocket doesn't understand high school biology about reproduction and gets a girl pregnant and doesn't understand how it was possible. Duh! Anyway, tediously long script showing the pickpocket art of stealing cellphones to pay a debt to a not-so-nice fence while running from the cops. Stereotypes of coping with the girl's pregnancy and dragging her into the fray only to have her turn his life around. Usual stereotypes of dumb cops, double crosses and redemption. Actors were cast for their respective roles by looks and the robotic acting showed why, Twilight obsessed vamps notwithstanding.A bit concerned with the consistent and continual portrayal throughout the movie that lying, stealing, avoiding responsibility, drinking, bad parenting all were shown in a positive light while the cops come out as conniving drinking dumbasses."
"Tossing bits of formula storyline into a box and shaking it does not produce anything but jumbled stuff. Just a few examples follow even though the entire movie is poorly edited, directed and the acting came across as actors just acting the roles and not understanding the roles. This potpourri strains credulity which for this type of movie you have to have.(1.) Pointless most of the first half hour showcasing partying at a climbing lodge. Helicopter scenic shots of hills, birds and the usual vehicle on a road. Overbearing drum and piano pounding sound effects to create tension when the acting and story is flat.(2.) Lots of scenes of Scottish Highlands at camera angles that made hills look like mountains; streams look like white water rapids. Pointless time spent on a very small town pagan honorific festival with fireworks made to look like New York City July 4th, all through different angles of the same firework. Lots of scenes of climbing equipment being assembled with multiple camera angles; turning a 30' drop into one that looked much further.(3.) People seem to repeatedly always show up at the same location despite the remote isolation. The first was our climbing group coincidentally finding a girl buried underground in a forest with only a small breathing pipe. The second that two hunters happen to be in the same spot. Then two more just walk up at the same remote spot and kill those hunters. then these two always seem to show up at the same location as our climbing party which has now split into two groups going in different directions yet all three groups seem to show up at the same location. Clever editing, in this case, made instanteous space travel possible.(4.) Buried girl is a kidnapped Serb Croatian - of course, since that's a currently popular ethnic plot point in movies. How the girl looks clean and fresh after being buried for days and the 3 inches of forest ground cover above her box looks undisturbed is quite a burying trick. She could have just pushed the lid up.(5.) Same girl is swept downstream and ends up underwater for ten minutes yet is revived by just breathing into her lungs. Hello, she should be dead and besides her lungs should have had water in them which needed to be cleared out first. When she revives it's as if she's waking from a nap.(6.) Climber falls down a hill and severely breaks an arm but later he using it just fine, then he says it was his leg that's broken so then he starts limping even though he was running previously when it was suppose to be his arm.(7.) Female climber is upstairs in an apartment that's engulfed in flames. She passes out, but in the next scene firemen are carrying her away. Such fast firemen (more editing) yet when the gunmen (who again seem to always know where to be) are going through the town shooting anyone they don't like, the police are no where to be seen.The ending reflected the movie in that it made little sense and went nowhere. Seemed like an afterthought finish. Great, and even good, movies pay attention to details and not just assume the audience is a bunch of not-paying attention toadstools."
I accidentally started this when scanning through so I can't rate it. Sometimes the movie starts when I'm trying to slide through the selections.
This movie makes absolutely no sense.  It's about a bunch of 19th century hookers.  Thought it might be an interesting topic and go into other aspects of history--but no.  It's just about the hookers.  Don't waste your time.
Didn't hold my interest and turned off the film after the first five minutes.  That's my impression and not a slam on this film without viewing it longer.
"We love Pawn Stars and appreciate being able to stream it but...Amazon's responsiveness has been horrid!!! They must improve on the responsiveness of the equipment serving up these videos. I essentially gave up after viewing just one episode (which we loved).The problem isn't once the streaming starts, but it is getting the system to the point where an episode can be selected and then started. I'm using a Roku3 box."
The people on &#34;reality&#34; tv are fake and they encourage our youth to laziness and an inability to use their intelligence for anything but staring dumbly at the television.
Not my cup of tea.  Used as background noise while using my PC mostly.  I really don't think casting a British &#34;pretty boy&#34; as a Maine outdoors &#34;man&#34; fit the part either.
"I thought this would be a nice little film about what to eat and how to get healthy as a vegan. Not so much. I should have known when they went to the grocery store and she was showing them what was and wasn't considered a vegan product. Did you know Oreo's are vegan? Yep! Wow, and so healthy for you...  That's when I realized the film maker wasn't so much interested in spreading a message about how to get healthy eating as a vegan, but was more interested in proving that eating animal products was contributing to animal cruelty. Yeah, and don't even get me started on all the soy crap they ""discover"". Soy is not a health food, people!!Personally, I already know all about how animals raised for food are treated. I read ""Diet For a New America"" many years ago and it totally opened my eyes. I was not interested in seeing that again. I understand that she wanted to prove a point, but I don't like the idea of forcing people to see that sort of thing without a warning to begin with. It felt like the filmmaker's only justification for being a vegan was the fact that animals raised as food are treated badly. It wasn't about health at all. The message I got was ""become a vegan so no more animals have to suffer"".And, if you don't know anything else, you're going to watch this and believe that ALL food animals are treated inhumanely.I had to stop watching this movie about half-way through, so maybe it isn't fair of me to give it a review, but I think it's important that other people know before going in, what's in store for them. It wasn't what I thought, and I don't want that message forced down my throat. I'd rather watch ""Food, Inc."" I thought it was a million times better than this."
"Too much fighting, too much he say, she say. These are grown woman in their 40's. I can believe how they carry themselves. We all hate Karen and Ramona, these are terrible woman. Happy to know they will eventually be leaving the cast. We all like drama in a show but this is ridiculous from these very old woman."
"In all honesty, if I see one more cat jump out from behind a door, I'm going to shoot my television.  I just can't bring myself to understand why anyone, ANYONE, would think that that was a good idea.  As a film director, how can you justify building a suspenseful sequence around an animal of any sort, but especially a cat, making noise in a dark corner and then popping out just when you think you're about to see something really terrifying?  It's beyond my comprehension.That being said, a stupid scene like the one mentioned would not and should not be enough to entirely write off any horror film.  It happens so often in horror films that you'd basically have to write them all off.  What CAN cause you to write off a horror film would be the fact that it just isn't scary.  I'm struggling because I honestly can't decide whether or not this was supposed to be taken seriously.  Maybe this was supposed to be a comedy or a spoof, you know, like `Scary Movie', but I know that it's not and that makes me confused.  This has got to be one of the most unintentionally funny films I've ever seen.  Each scene looks like something out of a poorly crafted comedy.  It reminds me of when I saw `Darkness Falls' and I laughed throughout, which is not the reaction you want from a horror film.Clich&eacute;s abound in this messy film that centers on a haunted hotel that is going out of business.  The employees are obsessed with the rumors surrounding the ghost haunting the hotel and they do everything they can to stir stuff up.  God, none of this works.  The performances are so affected and mannered and just bad and the direction is completely uninspired.I've seen a lot of bad films this year, but this may be the worst."
"The first 20 minutes or so the dialogue and acting led me think that a creative, well written and produced haunted movie was in the works. Wrong! They either quickly ran out of writing inspiration or money or both. It quickly fell into a cheap formulaic abyss. The rest of the movie moves like redundant molasses.Proof?(1.) Well, lots of newspaper clippings is a cheap storyteller and in this case it was newspaper clippings on a web page - shown over and over.(2.) Usual cheap prop of an army surplus recorder with analogue vu display to indicate some unknown sound. Duh, digital has been around for decades and, anyway, they have a limited frequency and amplitude range, so what's the point.(3.) Usual, couple of guests that add nothing to the story and you're left wondering why they were even in the story. Well, one guy decides to slit his wrists, in a bathtub, of course.(4.) Usual, mysterious sounds - well, they are in an old hotel!(5.) The usual mysterious self-closing door. Actually, a prop person standing behind and pushing it. Scary!(6.) Lack of details such as why the two inn employees are there; why they are closing such a expensively appointed and well maintained inn. Their dialogue dominates the rest of the movie and although it started out interesting it simply got tiresome after 90 minutes.(7.) Usual chain locked cellar door.Spoiler follows:(8.) Usual girl starts imaging ghosts and locks herself in the basement to subsequently die of fright complications thinking a ghost is chasing her but it's her co-worker banging on the door."
"Too slow-moving when the climax is there it couldn't get there soon enough and naturally predictable.Boring at times,and when the ""Horror"" did come it was gross in an bad and distasteful.The movie is more of an thriller than an horror movie,Glad I watched it on Netflix instant first than renting it or owning it.Not enough scares to be scary and not interesting enough for me to watch again."
"""You're just impatient! Ti West is a master at creating atmosphere! If you didn't like this movie, I'm sure Joel Schumacher will make a loud, angry horror movie one of these days! This is for TRUE fans of horror!""These are just a few of the retorts you hear from fans when you complain about West's slow-burn spookiness. I will grant, as others have done, that West does excellent work with a camera -- he frames and tracks some really sumptuous shots -- but atmosphere is no substitute for a story. I don't watch movies for atmosphere. That's why I buy lounge music, or candles, or fake cobwebs in October. If atmosphere is all a movie has going for it, then it's no better than one of those looped images of flickering fireplaces you can pop on the TV during Christmas.So what about the story? Isn't it scary? Nope. Two twenty-somethings -- Claire and Luke -- are the only staff members at the soon-to-close Yankee Pedlar Inn. With cheeky self-consciousness, they spend their many hours of free time searching the old hotel for one of the ghosts that is said to reside there. It's a fairly standard ghost story trope, and the addition of a psychic who has ""reverse deja vu"" does little to twist the story into something intriguing or new. There is, essentially, no story, which was a similar flaw in the nearly identical West film, The House of the Devil (girl left alone for a long time, strange goings-on, some people are not who they claim to be, incredibly slow atmospheric build to a cheap-show ten minute conclusion of sloppily written ""chills"").So the story sucks. Movies can still succeed by virtue of the characters alone, even if the plot is confusing or sloppy. Unfortunately, Luke and Claire, while well-acted and realistic enough, are not interesting characters. They speak with the kind of canned dialogue that screenwriters pen when they aren't sure what's supposed to happen next in the film. Sara Paxton tries desperately to make Claire appear as cute as she can in every scene; she looks like she took acting lessons from a newborn puppy. On the very, very few moments when the movie lets the viewers glimpse something creepy, the effect is numbed by Claire's mopey mugging.I'm certain it's meant to be funny, as it is often accompanied by hokey sitcom music. West seems to be as confused by comedy as he is by horror, though. The movie thinks things are funny -- a girl in her underwear runs by a small boy! it takes Claire five minutes to take out the trash! the coffee girl is socially awkward! -- but even if they were, they contribute nothing to the story or the characters. All in all, it's like watching two boring people making a movie about themselves being boring. Dull characters who are authentically acted are still dull.West obviously has an eye for making movies but not for telling stories. He tries too hard to be subtle and artistic. An excellent example is the final shot of the film. My friends did not understand why the camera held for so long on the final shot, but I saw what all of them missed. I won't tell you what it is, but I will say this: if you don't know it's there, it's almost impossible to see it. I only noticed the subtle little parting shot that West included in the scene because I read a review, like this one, telling me to look for it. And that's the thing: if your artistry is so subtle, so careful, so minute as to escape the notice of nearly every single viewer of your film, then maybe you're focused too much on the background stuff (like West's highly touted skill at creating atmosphere) and not enough on the actual meat of your movie (characters, story, conflict).Dialogue that treads water. Dull and annoying characters. Almost no story to speak of. Cliched plot. More than your average number of fake scares (I counted three before the first fifteen minutes). Unsatisfying climax and conclusion."
"My first relevant question would  be - how old was the person who wrote this?My guess would be somewhere around 12.Good ghost films are rare to be sure, and some make a reasonable effort.This one does not."
"Wow, what a boring movie, the cover had all these great reviews of how fantastic this movie is and that it's the best horror film of the year, what a let down, kept waiting for the horror to come, it didn't, my wife fell asleep it was the interesting, the characters were fine and the acting good, but the story was just not up to par, could not consider this movie as anything but a waste of time, sorry I bought it and paid full price, trying to hard, special effects were nothing special, no scares, they say old time creepy, not really, the old time horror movies that relied on atmosphere and story development are nothing like this movie, don't waste your time, though the movie might bore you to death."
"The folks who made this movie were trying for a scify horror story that,1,doesn't show any understanding of science ( you can't clone a human from red blood cells-they have no dna ),and,2, tries to go for horror with a 'The Shineing' rip off.What they do succed in is regurgitating anti abortion propaganda, and do the disapearing good christians in the rapture bit.A 'mad scientist' wants to clone people, why his project is protected by soldiers is anybodies guess. A woman fertility doctor who can't have children steals one of the cloned embrios and implants it in her womb in the womens toilet. Cut to 'seven years later'. The boy heals a dead mouse. Mother takes the boy to see the 'mad scientist' who by now has had a religous conversion and kills his family so they can go to heaven. He smothers his wife with a pillow and smothers his little girl with a teddy bear. Their bodies disapear leaving only thier clothes behind, just like all the people in the church did.'Mad scientist' was trying to clone jesus! Wants the boy to forgive him! Shoots mom whos body disapears. But, oops!, the boy isn't Jesus, he's the anticrist. Movie ends with him asking satan a 'knock knock' joke.Don't waist your time on this; theres nothing new or well done here."
"I'm Not Jesus Mommy (Vaughn Juares, 2010)For the first third or so of its length, save some subpar acting, I'm Not Jesus Mommy is an intriguing little low-budget movie that, on many levels, makes perfect sense. Kimberly Gabriel (Bridget McGrath in her first feature), an obstetrician, is haunted by her own inability to conceive. When maverick researcher Roger Gibson (Living Arrangements' Charles Hubbell) approaches her with a fat government contract and some snake oil about human cloning, she resists at first, but eventually sees the opportunity in light of her own ulterior motives. The obvious question becomes: how far will a woman go to have a baby?Then we skip forward seven years, and everything goes to hell. Earth is locked in the middle of a new ice age. The streets are dangerous, there is little food to go around, and Roger, Roger's sister, Kimberly, and Kimberly's son David are holed up in a small apartment, only going out when absolutely necessary to procure food. The entire remainder of the film takes place in that apartment.Sounds promising, no? And perhaps in the right hands, the final two-thirds of the movie could have been turned into the kind of tense sci-fi thriller that Vaughn Juares obviously intended this to be. But, and isn't there always a &#8220;but&#8221; after a statement like that?, it...isn't. I'm not entirely sure how to put this tactfully, so I'll go with &#8220;I'm not Jesus Mommy rivals The Room for moments of unintentional hilarity.&#8221;  One-room dramas live and die based on the quality of the actors involved, so the &#8220;some subpar acting&#8221; of the first third, which you can gloss over with everything else going on, takes center stage.  Add in a script that leaves out just a little too much to be impressionist and never avoids clich&eacute;&#8212;in fact, runs headlong into it as often as possible&#8212;and you've got something that ends up being a chore to sit through.  Don't hit play on this one unless you have prepared yourself for an overdose of cheese. *"
"When I read about the film in Redbox (Devil's Angel), it reveals information that is not revealed in the film until the last 5-10 minutes. I won't do that per se, but the film is so bad, spoilers won't matter.Full figured Dr. Kimmy Gabriel (Bridget McGrath) can not have a child, but keeps on trying. She is very pro-life and reluctantly accepts a position at a human clone project under Dr. Roger Gibson (Charles Hubbell). She steals a cloned embryo and implants it in herself. The film jumps to seven years later as the world is thrust into a post apocalyptic nightmare as Kimmy and her son David (Rocko Hale) live in a run down tenement living off government MRE handouts.The film has heavy religious messages as both lesion faced Kim and Roger are very religious and frequently read from the Bible and listen to radio preachers. This appears to be a ""come to Jesus film"" except the ""good guys"" do nothing heroic to save the day or themselves. Indeed, if anything they appear to be part of the problem which is to make a statement about the condition of human existence.This film is very low budget. The sets are meager. The acting is bad and dialouge has a religious corniness to it. It fails to get interesting until 10 minutes before the final credits and by then you pray for the end.Knowing the ""secret"" of the film by reading the by-line I couldn't help but think during the film...""Funny. He doesn't look Jewish.""Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Bridget McGrath cleavage."
"I've been reading Norse and Greek mythology since I could pick up a book, and even when I could understand the differences between the two, I knew that for the most part, Thor and Loki got along. Unlike the Greek gods, the Norse gods could die, but they never grew old -- and even Odin retained his savage strength until his death at the battle of Ragnorak. So to see Loki old and missing teeth is repulsive; and being so stereotypically evil is a sign of poor writing. Pass on this. True, Loki's actions in regard to Balder's passing did lead to Ragnorak and to his own death, as well as Thor's, Odin's and the other gods, but he wasn't the cackling super villain  depicted in these ridiculous cartoons. Buy the movies instead. They're more entertaining."
and should not be on tv. There is little redeeming value to this -only shock value. Swamp people is better
"This film is a great example of what you get when you forget about the importance of a story. Watch the first scene and pay attention, because that's exactly how the rest of the film will be. And don't let all the claims of gore and blood and violence lure you in, either. It's very tame and unrealistic. Too bad. Next time I hope this director will take the time to tell a story."
"First, get actors that can actually speak rather than mumble.  Or use subtitles.  I have to agree with the kitchen sink analogy. Because that's pretty much what the writers did.  Whatever was in their heads just came barreling out into a total mess. Or they were channeling ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"".  There is nothing coherent about this movie.  It simply makes no sense.  You can rattle on about Arthurian theories and some grand plan, but the bottom line is that it's just a bad movie.  It's billed as the number one horror movie of the year. Perhaps my definition of horror is different than the producers of this dreck. Because there was nothing horrifying in this crap.  Oh, it was gory and bloody alright.  But horrifying?  I'd call some of the singing on American Idol horrifying, but not this.  Perhaps they should let someone with a Hitchcockian background redo this into what could be a very good movie. And just because a movie makes you think, doesn't make it good. Actually, the only three thoughts you'll have is 1) what the hell is going on? 2) When will this crap end? and 3) How can I get my money back?.  Go see Expendables 2.  It's a bad movie too, but at least it's entertaining.  You'll never say that about Kill List."
Are you kidding me!  That is the only thing I can say after painfully suffering through watching one the worst non-horror films of all time.  This was not scary and the concept was very poor...watch this if you want to waste time and money.
"I'll be stunned if a worse movie comes out this year. If you liked Wicker Man and thought it needed to be slower, mix more genres, and be a bigger waste of time, then this film will be right up your alley. It's the kind of film that makes me rethink people's recommendations because if they liked this then we're most certainly looking for different things out of two hours of our time."
"Reality TV is supposed to bring the ""real world"" to TV.  If this program represents reality, give me fantasy any time. Here we have ""Dog"" and his minions prancing around in all their police/military style paraphernalia, followed by a TV crew and they are supposed to be ""sneaking up"" on some residence. Why not just get the local high school band out and really announce your presence in style? But then again, with the outfit Dog is wearing, perhaps the band would be wasted. Honestly, he looks like a worn out old guy who works Fremont Street in Vegas, charging for tourists to have their photograph taken with him.  Ok, so they find a car (a Sebring we are told many times) and we are besieged with shot after shot of each of the ""team"" in turn having a look through the car window. Now isn't that really exciting?  And if we are not seeing shots of someone looking through the window of the car, we are continually confronted with shots of Dog's wife's legs and her stiletto shoes. Now that is not a pretty sight.Yes, I am sure (from reading some of the other reviews) that there are people who really like the show.  But from what I have seen, this program is certainly not ""reality"", it is definitely not entertainment and it is absolutely not worth watching. The best thing that has happened is that this show has finally been ""pulled""."
"This is show is on par with VH1 Surreal Life in which I had experienced three episodes due to having the flu and not being able to change the channels. People get very dramatic when the camera is present. Include Gold Rush in that same category.Yeah, why watch if I do not enjoy them? The same reason I had to check why traffic is slowing down - to see the accident. Scenics awesome , at least on the episodes I had watched. But no more!Amazon, thank you, for even if these shows are starring the worse actors in the world the picture quality is awesome!"
"Sorry, just didn't care much for this one.  Truthfully didn't watch all of it.  A complete wast of time, absolutely nothing there."
"I thought me, my mom and step father would like this show so I set it to record on our FIOS.  It started out good.  I was interested in what was going on.  Then something happened.  With every episode it got wortse and worse.  Let me tell you why.  First, every episode, a lawyer, his wife, lawyers brother and brothers girlfriend escape military trained killers.  EVERY time.  At first I thought, they couldn't kill the people because they would get arrested.  Everyone would blame them.  But then I realized something.  No body execpt for about 5 people know what is gong on.  It's not like thousands of people know who is after them.  They could go on the street, shoot them in the head and run.  No one would ever know who did it.  Another thing that bothered me was when the lawyers wife would go talk to his clients about their case.  Would never happen.  Something else that annoyed me was a few episodes ago.  They had the man behind the stuff, the judge saw things that showed he did it, then she said she couldn't use it in cort because the lawyer acted as law.  Freaking crazy right?  Then the last episode, the way it ended made everything pointless.  It is as if they just said ""ok were done with this"" and ended it.  What a complete waste of time.  It's not even worth watching the first episode.Oh, another thing, an episode comes on, builds up, up, up goes on commercial, comes back on and starts building up to something new.  It is crazy.  They need to build up the story through the episode and stick with one thing.  They never solve anthing.  It's like you put a bunch of problems in a jar, stick your hand in and pull one out and that is whats next."
Remember Reggie Perrin? Don't be confused this is not the wonderful original but a poor and very unconvincing remake. Its terrible.
"The first season was the best, as it was more based on characters and the parts they played in the overall story.  Season two became less about the characters and more about the gore and violence.  We forced ourselves to watch the first three episodes of season 3, but it was just more gore and violence for its own sake.  We won't waste any more time watching more of it."
"First ten or fifteen minutes didn't hold my interest and so no reason to continue the agony, I shut it down."
"I was hoping to find this inspirational health-wise but instead I was bombarded by foul language, particularly the f word over and over.  I was very disappointed, I turned it off."
"My children, both teens, were very excited to watch this movie and both of them were barely able to finish it, and I don't think they would have if it hadn't been for putting down their own money to watch it. The story had promise, even with poor writing, but the differing levels of skills on the acting were at times distracting and at other times annoying. Simple not very believable. Unfortunately, my daughter (13), noticed it on prime this week and she said, &#34;What a complete waste of money.&#34;."
"Start with a subject then add the top conspiracy theorists and you end up with a 'documentary' on Puff the Magic Dragon VS Godzilla. Is the History Channel becoming the next Learning Channel - you know, where 'learning' is discovering Honey Boo Boo? Or how to have a litter of children? Or extreme couponing?  Isn't fact based history important or interesting enough without having to cater to the lowest common denominator and IQ?  If I were the 'Woman Born With 14 Thumbs' (hoping for the next prime time slot on TLC) all would be pointed down on this gobbly-gook!"
The moment you bring in a far right rabid dog and demagogue/fear monger like Alex Jones in as a contributor you destroy all you credibility you once had.
"We had such high hopes for the series, it became clear after a point that the writing like a lifetime movie. Some scandal and a few interesting situations but most of it lifetime movie. The actors can only do so much with the bad script,a few of the main characters are so self-sacrificing that it a bore. Still not sure what happen tot he grandmother. Watched many British series I recommend London Hospital, Downton Abby, Call the Midwife, He knew he was right, Upstairs Downstairs (1970's version) better written much more entertaining."
"Everyone that suffered through any of this lame, idiotic excuse for a film should be paid $1,000,000,000 for every minute they watched. In my case I made it through to 7 minutes & 12 seconds. Probably a record. I want my $7,200,000,000 NOW!!!Is this really suppposed to be funny????????????"
"This movie was almost literally painful to watch. I waited for it to get better, but it somehow managed to just get worse. It is amazing that I can't even think of one good thing to say about it. Thank goodness it wasn't longer. I think it could very well be the worst movie I have ever seen. It isn't just bad, but even in the weird and bizarre scenes it amazingly fails to be interesting. Absolute garbage pretty well sums it up, except that is probably being to kind to this movie (or perhaps unfair to actual garbage). I really wanted to give it zero stars."
"I'm not going to waste much of your precious time with this review. 'Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie' is quite possibly the worst film that I have ever seen. Will Farrell and Adam McKay are credited as producers, and should have known better.The film follows the monumentally untalented duo, Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim, as they set out to make a film for one billion dollars. They end up wasting the entire budget, a fact which the film's producer - Tommy Schlaaang (Robert Loggia, obviously working for the paycheck) - is not entirely thrilled about. The two idiots decide to renovate an old mall in hopes that they will be able to pay off the large debt. In the meantime, we are introduced to some of the most annoying, disgusting characters ever written, and are treated to insanely crude jokes involving pedophilia, feces, and body piercing.The writing is horrendous, the ""jokes"" are beyond disgusting and incredibly unfunny, and the two leads are headache inducing morons. Rarely have I ever been tempted to walk out of a film mid-screening. 'Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie' is a waste of celluloid. I hated every single second of it.Magnolia Pictures has given the film the royal treatment on Blu-ray, which includes an audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a gag reel.Directed by Tim and Eric, Rated R, 94 minutes"
"my opinion of this trial movie has been requested...i provide it here, and gratis (amazon, be grateful)...no one this side of a death wish would even consider translating this abomination into a feature...ciao."
"2012NR: You could get just as valid predictive feedback from a well thought-out trailer (aka movie commercial) combined with an internet-based audience poll. Unless of course the intended audience are people who have nothing better to do than to watch a 1hr 37 min commercial about a product that doesn't yet exist. Can anyone say ""advance sale on partially built beach front condo's that never complete construction?"" ... MFJLabs -1x"
2 groups fighting arguing and in my opinion have nothing to do with weaponry.  I wish they would have included some normal people instead of guys who thinks they're a big shoot.
"Not too funny to me, but my daughter lines Tosh .not sure what else to say here. Amazon is smazing."
"I rented this film but did not have time to watch, but as soon as I am able to see it will review it. It has got some descent reviews since its release."
This is a tedious slow boring movie of Scottish people trying to be funny....They are not.  I made it 45 minutes before finally turning it off in disgust.  I think the Director's family wrote the rest of these reviews as the seem to have no concept of character development or an interesting story...
"The director relies too much on shock, gore and camera tricks to create a sense of tension.  However these effects as used in this move act as a distraction.  The movies that are successful in creating a tension leave a lot to the imagination which is far scarier than fake blood poured all over the place.  If this movie is in fact made by teen agers, koodos to them a very good effort.  If however it is a professional production... yikes... not so good."
"Playback (Michael A. Nickels, 2012)Playback has the dubious distinction of being the lowest-grossing domestically-released American film of 2012 (it made a grand total of $252, playing on one screen for a single week). It's not the worst film I've ever seen--in fact, it's only the third-worst film I've seen today (and you never know, it might get worse after this!)--but that doesn't mean I would suggest you get within ten feet of a streaming copy of it.We open in 1994, with a young chap named Harlan Diehl (Dogman's Luke Bonczyk) killing his entire family save his sister's baby before being shot by police. Fast-forward fifteen years, and a group of high-school students, working on a project for their journalism class, are investigating the Diehl murders, headed by  Julian Miller (Purgatory House's Johnny Pacar) and his girlfriend Riley (The Master's Ambyr Childers). Julian enlists his stoner buddy Quinn (Black Swan's Toby Hemingway) to ""acquire"" some information that only the local police have access to; Quinn has an in to the police department in the form of Detective Frank Lyons (Christian Slater), an ephebophilic detective who keeps Quinn rolling in dough--or illegally-swiped evidence on the Harlan Diehl case, it would seem--in exchange for hidden-camera nudie-cutie flicks of the local hot high school chicks. The problem is, when Quinn gets his hands on the tapes, he finds that Harlan Diehl's legacy extends beyond the grave...If you haven't figured out within ten minutes of this movie starting what happened to the baby from the opening sequence, you haven't seen enough horror movies. That sort of predictability, unfortunately, plagues this entire production. Once you know all the principal high school students, you should be able to pause the film, sit down, and sketch out a list of who's going to die when. And you know what? You'd probably be close enough to right to be extremely disappointed in this movie. And you have every right to be; Nickles, a character actor (probably best remembered for portraying Jim Morrison in Wayne's World 2) who abandoned the screen to go behind the camera, does absolutely nothing to meddle with the formula. This is depressing, because given some of the angles this movie adopts (it would probably contain a host of minor spoilers to go into any detail, but I will say that my favorite character in the film, Wylie, portrayed by Galaxy Quest's Darryl ""Chill"" Mitchell, is a video-store clerk and would-be film historian whom Julian finds himself consulting more and more as they get closer to uncovering the mystery of Harlan Diehl's motivations), Nickels had ample opportunity to bend some corners, kick some sandcastles, what have you. And he took none of them.It's not necessarily a bad movie, but it is an extremely frustrating one, boring, predictable, and full of potential that will forever go unrealized. If you do end up watching it, well, you have my condolences. *"
"2009NR: The fact that three times as many rated this as 'Loved It' (27), as did those who rated it as 'Hated It' (9), speaks, in part, to why organizations like this are so successful. If someone can make a judgement (good or bad) based on a film which lacks both content and conclusion, then they're ripe for the next level of mind-control! Enjoy. MFJLabs 1x"
"I'm realy tired of so called cop shows that deal with 'alternate realities'. This one lost my interest in the first five minutes. I just don't care.Mistery and suspence should be based on real life. There is plenty there. Imaginary situations should be left to sci-fi and fantasy, not a suposed 'real world'.Thumbs down, all the way on this one!"
There's nothing at all in the first 10 minutes to keep anyone interested.  I bailed early because I was falling asleep.
"The first episode of any new series has the unstated obligation, both to its audience and for the sake of its own survival, to grab us viewers by the throat -- and never let go.If lackluster Episode 1 of AWAKE -- and that's all I've watched thus far -- is any indication of what's on the horizon, then expect to see this poorly directed series aborted before the completion of its first term.What I found most irritating was the unsubtle (unconvincing!) transition between the two alleged realities. They just seemed to pop up out of nowhere, adding to the already confused plot.After the first 40 minutes -- AND HERE COMES A POSSIBLE SPOILER, FOLKS, SO BEWARE! -- I had an uneasy sense of foreboding (so did two other friends watching this) that it was our hapless protagonist himself who had actually died (not his beloved wife or son) and who now was destined to wander around LOST (like that other series) in an alternate realty between this world and the next...or at least until ""The Redeeming Light of Truth"" -- hopefully not another contrived deus ex machina --  might set his hitherto unenlightened soul free."
"People alive in boxes whether buried or not have shown up in a few movies the past couple of years, e.g. ""Buried"". This one had more techy stuff (camera, phone, CB radio, annoying red LED clock) and had the more elaborate plot of trying to extort information from it's (How did I get here?) occupant. Just like a person in a box not knowing what's going on, this viewer felt like they were in a box in being mostly clueless and bored 90% of the time while watching just a person in a box with only increasingly predictable dialogue to keep from dozing off. To make it worse the writer & director tossed in two twists at the end that not only were stupid-unrealistic but made the preceding 91 of 92 minutes seem even stupider."
"I started to watch the first episode and nearly fell asleep at the start! The intro to the teams competing was too long. i think there were too many competitors too! When the two brothers started their talk on their background, I stopped downloading/streaming and went to somethng else.This series main goal is to capture the competitors emotional up and downs for drama - same attention drivers give when passing a traffic accident. Slow and tedious."
The new vampire and werewolf do nothing for the show... did not enjoy it at all. Miss the other characters they were awesome
"~Sadly, many will consider this is true history but it's not!It's pathetic what is put into gullible minds as fact when the actual history is so much more interesting.Queen Mary was a Caucasian with red/auburn hair. That is an important part of true history because when the executor overheads her he had no ideal by that time in her life she was wearing a wig & when he went to hold up her severed head for the crowd her head fell out & he was left holding the red wig.Also, the good-looking Prince/king was no were near being the stud portrayed. Facts are he was very slight in size, had a deformity, & was always sickly.It's no wonder our children (USA) are so behind in school compared to so many other countries watching this FICTION believing it's true.Had this been a show with fictional characters I would have enjoyed it."
A waste of time and $.  Don't fall for this one.  I didn't mind the waste of $1.99 as much as I resented the waste of time.  =(
"Wow. I thought I was going to watch an interesting historical series and learn some new things about some historical figures.  I tried to watch two different episodes, one on Ben Franklin and one on Abraham Lincoln.  I felt like I was watching TMZ!  Honestly, sensationalistic poo!!  I looked up the ""historian"" who narrates this program and discovered that names of 2 novels he had written: one entitled ""Gay Power: An American Revolution"" and the other entitled ""One Nation Under Sex"" which he co-wrote with...wait for it...Larry Flynt!! Yeah.  That pretty much tells me what kind of ""history"" this man is interested in.  This show literally turned my stomach.  Very disappointing.  Unfortunately, this is what some think of as entertainment in our dumbed-down, sewer-minded society."
"This is one of those movies that just doesn't go and or do anything.  It just lies there, dormant and motionless until the credits roll and your eyes readjust to the light.  What is sad is that there is so much potential within the prose, and even the approach (restraint as opposed to abrasiveness) is welcomed and yet falls so flat it becomes tiresome.  The base plot feels almost silly, never really feeling like a genuine plot and more or less like a child's short story taken over by a screenwriter attempting to make it more adult themed.  The characters are skeletons, the revelations are minute and the overall impact is barely a scratch.  Dafoe sleeps through his performance and builds no depth between his character's motivations and his eventual arc, but at least Sam Neill and Frances O'Connor (she needs more roles) offer up some great supporting performances that actually build a backstory.  At the end of the day, two sharp performances and some beautiful scenery cannot a good film make.  This bore of a tale never fully gets off the ground, despite many attempts to do so.  I understand that this is a more internalized film, but there never seems to be enough reason to care much for what is unfolding.  At the end of the day, it says very little.  If you want an internalized look at a life of regret and personal upheaval, check out 2010's `The American'.  This film tries to mirror the approach, but fails to nail it in any way."
"What a slow moving movie, very boring until the very end.SPOILER:  I have a BIG problem with how this ended, being that he kills the endangered animal in the end, only to THEN decide to not give in to Red-Leaf and burn the remains instead of turning them into that company.  Why not have just left it alone, he definitely wasn't helping the animal by offing it.  Stupid, Stupid, Stupid hunter.  Movie would have at least made MORE sense if after killing the animal he turned the specimens over after all that happened.  But then again, I hate hunting and people that kill animals as sport or leisure."
Another Hollywood movie that features a big name actor that turned out to be total crap! I can't imagine why such a notable actor would accept a role in this movie. Is he that hard up for money??? Movie is slow and boring and has very little to do with hunting a rare tiger. Are there no good writers left in Hollywood??? Boring and a total waste of time. Don't spend a penny on this film. Shame on you Hollywood!!!
one of the worst movies of all the time...terrible movie..who wrote this movie??? the director must be shooooot himself...this is a low cheap budget movie terrible...stay away...
"The movie is short, thank goodness for that. The plot was too silly (over an hour stuck in a ATM). The acting was stiff at times, if I was a killer I'd just stand outside the whole damn time????The movie obviously has many flaws and if it was released at a Box Office it would have bombed. I expected something better but just like P2 and other junk films called ""Thrillers"" this movie was not that."
this movie was so bad....dont want to waste time explaining it...good concept?!?! but ultimately really really awful.thank god it was free.
"Note: I saw this online with XFinity On Demand.This show attracted my attention, despite my having read about the name change the show went through from its disturbing original title, which is extremely disrespectful and irreverent. Based on ABC's excellent track record this year (though they were stupid enough to cancel the reboot of Charlie's Angels, Once Upon A Time and Revenge have been major successes for the network; they should have given Charlie's Angels a shot at sticking it out), I decided to give this series a shot, but just for the pilot, as I also found out that there's a gay character on the show. Why does almost every television series have a gay character on TV these days? It's nauseating. But I digress.Watching the pilot episode of this show was like seeing my cousin on drugs. Primarily, this series makes Christians look hypocritical and superficial. Granted, there ARE some Christians like that, but not all Christians are hypocritical, superficial, judgmental, and promiscuous, as this show strongly implies they are. Jesus saith unto His disciples, Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature."" This series is doing exactly the opposite; it's spreading a bad reputation of Christians and ultimately blasphemes the Name of Jesus, our Lord and Saviour. And scenes in a bar with an extremely suggestive name? Come on, Disney! Why are you doing this? You're a FAMILY-FRIENDLY company. (Thank God, the gay thing was only IMPLIED, but I do not want to know how far ABC will go).This series is another one I will definitely NOT be watching."
"I am so tired of every show either having some sort of gay element or bashing on Christians. Are the writers just lazy or have they run out of ideas?I know that ""shallowood"" puts out a lot, and I mean a lot of trash, but this is really something.  Just in the title alone I do not know how women are not up in arms over it. Maybe it is a way to get people to watch the show. The free preview was enough to make me gag.I am up for giving a show a chance, but not this one.Update: Good for ABC. They canceled this garbage!!"
The theme was boring. The actors/experts were boring. There was no story line. I left the movie after 30 minutes.
"NO way no more. how did it make it to a second season. never again. Dumb, just plain dumb. Paint drying would create more drama."
"This is typical American entertainment. Not really with it, but all that these great creators can come up with. Just watch the network channels and you will see the same crap."
I'm not a big fan of reality shows and I don't watch them regularly.  I saw 15 minutes of one episode and it was too much. Scratch this one off the list.
"It had its moments, I admit. Watching the more sensible family members react to the less sensible ones was amusing, but only mildly. I like redneck humor as much as anyone, and I don't regret watching one episode to see what all the fuss is about, but I've no interest in seeing more. The trouble is, it's not clever. It's zany and a little perverse, but it has to be clever to keep me coming back. This show has a tremendous following, of course, so there's clearly an appetite for this stuff, but I've got better ways to spend my time. If I were more of a drinker, I'd probably enjoy getting sloshed with some friends and guffawing at these real-life millionaire hillbillies. But I thought a lot of what I was seeing was scripted, or at least heavily edited to make it come out a certain way. But then, that's my general impression of so-called reality shows, of which I'm not a fan."
"We really do need more shows about stupid white people because we really don't have enough.  I mean there in only 'The Real World&#34;, &#34;Jersey Shore&#34;, half the shows on the history channel.  I guess this is special though, it has hill billies in it."
"If you haven't purchased this yet, don't bother. As another reviewer wrote, Season 2 was probably the best, but it was slowly downhill from there. This season hit the bottom. Minimal effort on all fronts."
I enjoyed the shows and now every time I try to access one it says c content not available this is not the show rather something with Amazon
"Too much reality...did not watch but 10 minutes....not my kind of show. There is nothing more to say. Really, really."
I am a sucker that wasted my money by going with the cover picture (the statue ofLiberty pounded by flaming meteors ). Cool picture..could be a good film....NOTSad ...very Sad...  and you will be very sad if you waste any of your qualitytime for this piece of turd.Watched 5 minutes...fowarded the rest...then straight for the Garbage...No regrets on the money that i lost...I think this Studio....is worse that Asylum....can you believe that....im startingtoo.................
"This movie rates as my all-time worst movie ever made.  A third grader can make a more coherent and interesting movie.This movie is supposed to be about the end of the world, at 4:44am covering the last evening and morning.  To sum up the movie there is:-overly extended sex scene.  Willem Dafoe is gross.  It's not hot or sexy, but if you want a sex scene, don't drag it out... 30 seconds would have done rather than the 5-plus minutes of amateur shots.-painting.  Lady, we get it, you paint.. and your paintings suck.-walking.  Lots of walking for no purpose.  In one scene, a stationary camera filmed the actress walking from one end of the apartment to the other... for 30 seconds.  No cuts, just one long shot.-lots of tv clips of interviews... this is a good 1/3 of the movie and serves no point what-so-ever.-going out on the balcony and looking meaningfully at the McDonald's across the street.-being shocked, absolutely shocked that you watched a person climb over a 4th story railing and jump off the building to their death... and then Dafoe, a few seconds too late yells out like he wanted to help him.  You watched him climb over the railing and said nothing.  Are we supposed to believe you didn't know he was going to jump?-Visiting friends who are partying.  One of the won't do drugs because he wants clarity for the end... are we supposed to believe that.-THE ABSOLUTE LACK OF ANY DISCERNABLE SCRIPT AT ALL.  Everything was ad-libbed with a general idea of what to talk about.. and it shows.  At least reality TV is fun and more scripted than this disaster.-Some asian kid delivers chinese take-out a mere few hours before the end of the world... why?  Like anybody would actually be working?-The movie is one long ad for Skype.I wanted EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER AND PERSON ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FILM TO DIE.  Even the ending was messed up as it took about 5 minutes to pass 2 minutes of time.... and the end of the world is a fade to white.  You don't even get to see these horrid actors burn which would have been the only redeeming characteristic of this travesty impersonating a film.I am shocked Willem Dafoe is in this.  Him having made this makes him clearly not Willem Dafriend as the movie and his performance clearly show no respect for writers, cinematographers, filmmakers, directors, actors, the audience, the popcorn guy, not even the cockroach that eats your dropped popcorn.  They should pay you to watch this movie but even that is cruel and unusual punishment.Watched on Showtime as it comes with my cable package."
"I am very open minded when it comes to movies in general and indie films.  And I am a huge Willam Dafoe fan as he is a great actor, but this movie was a tragic waste of time, space and MONEY.  I can't believe I paid $6.99 to watch this terrible movie!  The script was terrible, character development poor, acting okay and there were NO special effects for an end of war movie.  Throughout this film, I could not help that this was a political (global warming, save the planet) infomercial.That said, save your time and money on this one...not worth watching!"
"A newscaster telling people to just be with their loved ones because it was all going to end - the scene is rather haunting in its own right. There is a sense of despair and giving up as everything is gone. That's a great moment but it's unearned. It's unearned because it is coming in the middle of a movie full of these non-action moments that are supposed to be haunting and mysterious but ultimately just prove dull and uninspired. Whether Willem Dafoe is going on the roof and yelling at people or they are ordering Chinese food, nothing is really happening in this things.If these moments were part of an overall story, great. But they are simply scenes from boring people in a nice apartment sitting around and waiting for things to end.Never has a movie depicted characters that are so in tune with the audience."
"Not as funny, and Gibby as a grown-up is kinda sad.  Carly's older brother is not as cool this time around.  He just does the same ol' stuff.  Sad."
This show is unwatchable and horribly acted. It is also extremely boring and not funny in the slightest. Don't waste your money on this crap.
"I understand that ""iCarly"" is a wildly popular television series, so because of my negative criticism of its quality I will probably wind up receiving a number of negative votes from customers. But, as we start, I just would like to politely ask you to please read my full review first before deciding whether or not my critique was unhelpful.When this program first started, albeit it did generate a few chuckles (and at one point it left me laughing hysterically), for the most part I was not highly amused by it, and seeing as this is usually my sense of humor, I was confused as to why I simply did not find most of this entertaining. But as the years have passed by, I realized exactly why I was not amused: because it can be so amazingly hokey that it is a wonder as to why it grew to be so popular.And I realize that hearing about it may SOUND funny, and hearing about a few comedic elements featured in the series make it seem interesting, but to provide you with an example of what ""iCarly"" truly is like, I would like to ask you to think back to a moment where you tried a new food for the first time that you figured you would fall in love with or assumed would taste delicious, based on the fact that it looked delicious or that many people had described it to you as such before. Then when you actually sampled the dish for the first time, you found it so disgusting and foul that you couldn't bear another spoonful of it, or, at first, you enjoyed it and kept going at it, but, little by little, you slowly and gradually started to realize how nasty it truly tasted and couldn't handle it anymore. Or, maybe you just wanted to like it so badly that you had actually managed to convince yourself that you did, when in fact you did not at all or barely did. That is what ""iCarly"" feels like.Right away, someone may not realize the cheesy qualities of a majority of the jokes featured in this series. But, if you watch a few episodes and really focus on the little bits and pieces of dialogue and their content, you will slowly start to realize how corny it really is. Not to mention that the titular character possesses a few Mary Suish qualities; she is pretty, sweet, ""funny"" (or so the program labels her as) and normally does what is right, albeit she is still prone to a few bratty moments. Not to mention that she is the object of multiple infatuations amongst boys and gets good grades, and she lives a teeny-bopper's dream life; raised by an eccentric (but annoyingly childish and dimwitted) older brother who is noteworthy for crafting the most idiotic art projects imaginable (a Christmas tree decorated with fake noses instead of ornaments, for example), grouchy, ill-tempered teachers who are so mean and furious and over-exaggerated that they can seem stupid at times, and so many over-the-top, unrealistic situation comedy storylines. There is constant shipping amongst characters (""Team Edward""/""Team Jacob""-type shipping) and the problem is that the main characters almost NEVER LOSE. I can remember at one point where they did, but that is just about it, unless you count the episodes where everyone loses but everything somehow manages to turn out sunshine and rainbows anyway. Carly always manages to come out on top at the end, never comically losing, really, of course everyone loves what she does and she always winds up winning, everything turns out right. I once heard a reviewer comment that the program serves as an escape for children from reality. Yeah, it does, for spoiled teeny-boppers who think that the world revolves around them. ""iCarly"" would not last a day if we were living in a world of children's television of higher quality, mark my words. A lot of times, it's so corny it sounds an awful like the deliberately-horrible attempts at making a cheesy situation comedy you may find people watching on other shows and being bored by. NICKELODEON IS SLOWLY EVOLVING INTO THE DISNEY CHANNEL! EVERYBODY RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!"
"There are few touching moments in this film.  But you have to wait to find them.  It's the waiting part that ruins the film.  What I remember most is that none of the characters had any redeeming qualities.  They were all weak, is some way or another."
I watched this as a Prime customer for free.  It was worth about half of that.  Very similar to stepping in dogcrap.  Now I have to go bathe.
"""Meeting Evil"" is a movie of stupefying logic, inept writing, willful unpleasantry and a couple of good actors who are cashing checks and hoping no one sees them. To get through half the picture you will need to suspend your disbelief to the point of drooling in your popcorn. This is the sort of film recycled with parts from much better movies (Collateral, Kalifornia, Cape Fear, Jackson's own Lakeview Terrace), so surprises aren't exactly in store, the dialogue is painful to hear and the characters bear no resemblance what so ever to real people, they don't even bear any resemblance to movie characters; for example their is a small child and her dog who stand in the same spot for what must be hours in movietime, and it is for no discernible reason. Who this film exists for could be a study unto itself, but anyone with a working braincell or any self respect need not apply. This is more along the lines of audiences who wish not to be entertained, perhaps have never seen a better movie, or just like to say that they have sat through a film of near unbearable pain and lived to tell about it.The plot has timed, mild mannered real estate agent John (Luke Wilson) having a real sad sack of a day, he lost his job, his mortgage is in foreclosure, he has a stack of bills that read ""past due"", and he fights with his wife (Leslie Bibb) for no particular reason. Then Richie (Samuel L. Jackson) enters his life, at first unassuming, but soon he reveals his very dark nature. Richie turns out to be a psychopath on a killing spree, a dozen in under an hour from my calculations, and he brings John unwittingly along for the ride. Richie's motives seems to be nothing more than to turn John into a killer like him, or perhaps he believes it will turn him into a man like him. Obviously this will end up with John being mistakenly suspected of the crimes by the local inept authorities, of course it all ends at John's house over dinner with Richie terrorizing the wife and kids.The film tries to work on a more psychological level, I guess, but it totally fails. The movie never actually explains any motives for the killing spree or any insight into the Jackson character, it seems as if he is supposed to be the embodiment of evil, possibly even the devil himself, but he is actually just a remorseless killer, or is he. The film leads to a dubious denouement, followed by a rather obvious cliched confrontation and then an unsatisfying anti-climax. This picture looks like it is under the inept impression that is supposed to be a character study, but it has no characters to study.Samuel L. Jackson is easily one of the best actors of his generation, but of late he has been stuck in something of a rut, he plays leads in terrible movies that go mostly unseen (The Cleaner, Unthinkable, Arena) and his successes of late have been cameos in superhero flicks. Here he plays a caricature of the Sam Jackson character, something else he has been doing a lot of lately, after just a few minutes of his shtick here the performance becomes unbearable to watch. Luke Wilson doesn't fare much better, in fact he is unable to conceal his boredom with this trite, tedious material. But some of the supporting work is much worst, I suspect some of these ""actors"" were just friends, relatives, or investors. Supporting characters are portrayed even more dimly like the local police, embodied by Muse Watson as a cranky old veteran, and Tracie Thomas as his black stereotype female partner named Latisha.Directed by Chris Fisher, who adapted the screenplay from a novel by Thomas Berger (Little Big Man, Neighbors), I had never heard of this filmmaker before so I did a check on him over at IMDb, I soon discovered why I did not know him. Up to this point he has been known for directing some pretty poorly received direct-to-dvd potboilers, titles like ""S. Darko"", ""Street Kings 2: Motor City"", ""Dirty"", ""Nightstsalker"", ""Rampage: The Hillside Strangler Murders"". ""Meeting Evil"" is Fisher's first theatrical film, well sort of, you see it's premiering on cable/satelite TV and then video on demand, before receiving a belated theatrical release in a few theaters. I suspect the limited theatrical release is an attempt to help Jackson save face, but they shouldn't have bothered, his career will be better served the sooner that this one is forgotten.I know, I know  if you can't say anything nice, ...just one more thing, please. Add to this some of the most cloyingly pretentious cinematography, provided by Marvin V. Rush, a close collaborator on some of Fisher's previously mentioned glories. Even at roughly ninety minutes ""Meeting Evil"" truly feels like an evening of unbearable torture. Yes, I believe that this the definition of torture porn."
"This has been done so much better so many times .... both in books and film that I found it to be quite dull and predictable.  Characters are stereotypes.  I don't know who to blame -- producer?  writer?  director?  I watched 30 minutes then skipped to the end to see if I had figured out who did it  -- I had, but anyone familiar with the genre would do the same."
"This was really disappointing.  As a long time Spiderman fan this show comes off as silly, and targeted at the youngest of children."
"and spiderman uses it like a toy and that's even the name of the episode like a toy..love to be able to watching it for free on Netflix, but very disappointed that I had to pay to watch it on amazon when I can watch it for free on Netflix, thanks again amazon for being to tricky sneaky and cheap"
I love this series and am a big fan but.....Giant robots???  Seriously???  All the other episodes are outstanding but this one is pathetic.
"There is no way to shut off the reply function on this review. If there were, I would.If you are the kind of person who is easily offended or wants to slam an individual for having an opinion that doesn't follow along with the masses, then don't read this. There are other reviews better suited to you. DeeLam and Lee make excellent points for how great they feel the show is. If you want that, then I strongly recommend you go there. Heck, Shinashi didn't even write a review of the first episode, but she felt so strongly about it that she'll attack total strangers to defend it. I guess if you judge a thing by the company it keeps, then let your eyes be the judge and read on.Just to warn you, if you read this you will probably hate me for it. You will probably formulate ideas about my lack of intelligence and want to reply numerous times telling me how bad a human being I am. Likely, you will want to pick apart every word of my review. It may be an attempt to mirror how ""harsh"" one person called this review, or how ""brutal"" another dubbed its author. At this point, I don't even care*. I wrote this to offer another opinion besides the hyperbole being showered upon this episode.Finally, this review is for this episode only. I have watched no other episode in the series. This episode was bad enough that I could not follow it any further. I'm sure you'll want to attack me for that too.I am not writing this to attack or offend anyone... except maybe TLOK. If you feel like my perspective is faulty, ignorant, or just plain belligerent, I don't care*. If you don't even care what I have to say, but want to bash ME for making the comment, I don't care*. If you are a parent just looking for a show for your kids to watch, eh, this will keep them entertained. It has lights and motion. Lots of bells and whistles. It's either this or the Backyardigans (although I think the latter is better conceived). Pick your poison.*When I say I don't care, I don't mean that I don't think other opinions are valid. I just think that attacking my opinion as if it were an academic point to be disputed with counter facts laced with subtle and not-so-subtle inferences and implications of my indignity, THAT I don't care about.The review:1) Aang's epic journey in the original show from the village of the Southern Water Tribe to the Fire Nation did not have to end with the defeat of the Fire Lord. There were lots of other aspects of this world and the personal development of the characters that could easily have carried a whole new story arc. Giving up on the characters felt like a betrayal. Why become invested in their story if you are just going to kill them off?2) The unresolved segue that ended the final season of The Last Airbender, Zuko's hunt for his exiled mother, along with the mysterious fate of Jet, the budding romances of Aang and Katara, and Sokka and Suki, and even the fate of Azula and former Lord Ozai were all like an invitation to come back for the next season, a season that would never come.3) The Legend of Korra suffers from her status as the direct inheritor of the Avatar mantle rather than a third or fourth generation descendant. This first episode is where the protagonist is supposed to shine, but we are bogged down by repetitive info dumps about characters and plot lines from the original that, other than providing latent back story, have no place in Korra's story. The problem is, the writers were apparently indebted to the fans of the original, and felt inclined to provide a brief synopsis of each element of The Last Airbender that would no longer play a part in this new tale. That was spread out ham-handedly over most of the show. It had the feel of a weak story picking at the bones of a once stronger carcass. If you don't like that analogy, pick your own to suit.4) Aang earned his powers. He did not have to try terribly hard to gain the most potent, if basic, versions of the bending techniques, but when he failed to study he paid for it on several occasions. Korra was instantly given mastery of all the bending schools except Airbending. There is no room for growth if your protagonist is already a powerhouse. Characters who start off near the height of their glory are typically in tragedies, not adventure tales. If Korra is not learning, then she is just throwing around power with no relevance to her development, nor that of the story line. In fact, because she is so powerful, it makes her seem like a whiny brat when she can't learn what she wants exactly when she wants. Her flight to the city is more like the running away tantrum of a baby than an heroic quest.No, Korra's story did not need to follow Aang's exactly, but she should not just have everything handed to her. If she had been a fourth generation decedent, that would have allowed her story to stand alone and would have better explained and justified the change in venue I make a point of next...5) The tech of the original show was driven specifically by the bending power of their creators. Firebenders were able to create heat to power the motors that drove their vehicles. Airbenders used kites to flit over the clouds. Waterbenders surrounded their communities in ice walls, and Earthbenders used stone to implement a mass-transit system for people and cargo. In fact, there was no significant socioeconomic development that did not have it's innermost source in bending. There is a reason why we have the expression, ""necessity is the mother of invention"". If you do not need the improvement, it is unlikely that you will make strides to discover it.All of a sudden, Korra goes to Aang's science city and finds microphones, televisions, cars, printing presses, guns, and all the other conveniences of modern society. Did everyone forget that Aang, Katara, and Sokka used to have to make camp complete with camp fires, bed rolls, and fish they had caught from a stream, as well as protect themselves with swords, boomerangs, and staves?Korra is not that old, and Aang did not appear to be that old when he died. This means that the society's evolutionary jump happened in about a quarter of a lifetime. This would be the equivalent of going from the renaissance era to the late industrial era without any stop in between. Bending cannot account for that, especially when this society seems decidedly anti-bending. If the civilizations that came before Aang, all of which had bending powers, had not come up with this super society, how now brown cow? There were-what, 500 or so Avatars before Aang? None of those guys ever ignited a spontaneous information age.Was Aang secretly sporting a Stephen Hawking level intellect that we just did not know about? It makes no sense.6) These 5 points each have an individual negative impact on the texture of the episode, but when contrasted with the oddly exuberant viewpoints of the other reviewers of this episode make one final sixth point, a sort of conspiracy theorist's coffee table distraction if you will. How do you make such a crap-tastic product and find yourself fully stocked with rave reviews? Well, corporations that create profiles on Facebook hire ""Facebook Developers"" to add 2 or 3 hundred thousand ""likes"" to their brands to increase faith in their products. To me, it seems like such a poor product as The Legend of Korra, Episode 1 generating such miraculous reviews is blatantly serendipitous. If you are the author of one of these reviews and take exception to this suggestion, it is merely that. I don't care if it is true or not. I merely point all of this out to highlight the following advice:Think for yourself. Watch the episode with an open mind like I did. If you think it's the best thing you ever saw, ""like"" it on facebook! If you think it sucked like I did, be careful should you place a review that states this. You may just be painting a target on your back, again, like I did. Don't let people TELL you what to like, when to laugh, or to accept their hackneyed writing pell-mell."
"I read the other reviews before writing my own.  The interesting thing is the case was solved.  It would be great if the episode was amended to include the rest of the case.  The &#34;psychics&#34; were basically dead wrong, and the police were right all along.  If the detective had found the lost tip, instead of wasting time with these &#34;psychics&#34;, the case might have been solved sooner.  To read about the case, just google &#34;Susannah Chase murder&#34;."
"these women never discover anything. they 'sense' things that have been in the news for months at one time. even tho they've faded from public view, they never really come up with any enlightenment."
I had a hard time trying to get into this story. Not something i wanted to spend time watching on.
"A rating of PG is outrageous.  The explicit  overreach of sexual content is beyond the pale.  This is not a movie for children, teens, twenties, thirties etc......Movie studios need to wake up to their responsibility to the milieu.  When Almighty God told us not to break the Commandments,  He Meant It. A wink and nod has been given to the Movie studios and now we live with the consequences  and spiritual cost of all of it.  Must I explain the difference between love and lust or do most of you get it?  The acting was horrible, the story line was chopped up and the unredeeming end was a poor excuse for a movie. My Uncle fought in the Great War so believe me when I tell you that the men did not sit around the trenchs WHNING. They fought and died to win our freedom from tyranny by pushing the enemy back to Berlin.  This movie belongs in the hall of shame."
I just couldn't finish watching this one given the graphic portrayals of the sexual relationship between the two principal characters.  While the relationship was central to what story line I could find (and that in itself was a challenge) I think it completely unnecessary to film the scenes in such graphic ways.  I watch LOTS of British TV and drama but just had to turn this one off!
"This video\series, wait I don't know about the entire series, because I could not get through one episode. I have enjoyed many of the series that kindle\amazon offer, no t this.  Wait is it possible to give a star-?"
"I haven't watched the show in awhile.  I just watch the end of the year reviews.  What incredibly stupid people!  Nothing ever gets resolved.  No one changes for the better.  The most ignorant of them all, in my opinion, is Caroline Manzo.  She needs to  learn how to shut up.  I also think that, as imperfect as she may be, Teresa is the most interesting and, in spite of the ""napalm"" error, she is probably the most intelligent of the bunch.  I don't understand why they are all ganging up on Teresa, but perhaps it is all a set up, in which case, we are fools for watching this garbage."
"the story is so cliche; the acting is so rehearsed, forced and unnatural; the banter between the characters is so annoying and stale- I made it 25 minutes before I called it quits.people who've rated this ""movie"" 2+ stars seriously need to have their amazon reviewing privileges revoked!"
"The primary problem with the found footage genre is that it blatantly violates the first rule of good storytelling, which is show, don't tell. In my opinion I think this genre has run it's course, it jumped the shark a Paranormal Activity or two back for me.  And I actually fully enjoyed the first Paranormal Activity as well as the underrated The Last Exorcism, at least until it's cop out ending. I even value The Blair Witch Project, more when it was first released than I do today, but it delivered what it promised, which may not have been much, but it delivered none the less.The latest crop of this genre, has nothing new to offer, the only interest can possibly be from people who enjoy the tedium of watching people do tedious things. These movies pretty well offer no surprises, one character in this film even states that he had figured out what was going on the moment that they walked through the door, amen. The jolts come from the surprise sprung on the drowsy half asleep viewer who has an hour in come to except that nothing will happen. I have even fallen pray to that.So is this some deep rooted grudge that I hold against the whole genre that has me lambasting the new flick Apartment 143: not at all. This is a particularly bad example of an all ready dwindling genre that year after year continues to deliver ever further diminishing returns. Apartment 143 is the lamest, worst written and poorest acted that the genre has had to offer, yet.The story has three paranormal investigators, or more accurately as the syfy channel calls them, ""ghost hunters"" setting up cameras to help the White family find out who keeps ding dong ditching their front door. There are, of course, other signs of a ghostly haunting, the usual flickering lights, creaky sounds, prank phone calls, etc.The Whites it seems have suffered a lot lately, other than receiving disturbing phone calls from beyond, they have suffered a family tragedy. The mother of the family died in a car wreck, this leaves dad (Kai Lennox) distraught and guilt ridden, hot teenage daughter Catlin (Gina Mantegna) obnoxious and rebellious, and little Benny (Damian Roman) sad and talking to the ghosts that only he can see; sorry audience, guess we're just left out again.We get to watch father-daughter squabbles, with them and others spouting dialogue that is way too stiff to be spoken by real people. Then something happens, nothing special, but it happened. Finally some pervasive scares scenes, usually punctuated by a shaky camera movement, so that we can't really see anything, but know for sure that it is scary. This all goes on for an excruciating eighty minutes, but you will swear it was much longer. Oh, and the last shot is a total rip-off of the ending to the original Paranormal Activity.Found footage films try to follow in the noble foot steps of the great Val Lewton tradition by being about atmosphere and implication, well they can hope in one hand, and I will let you finish the metaphor. The only scares I get is when I realize that this is not the last of the genre, probably not even the worst: there is said to be a Christian themed film on the way about the horrors of finding some old VHS porno tapes, shriek. Well I guess there is an audience for it, at least we are past the torture porn cycle, but can someone please get back to making decent interesting horror films.Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com"
"Enjoy the dinosaur picture on the cover as this movie is really aboutanoying people wich will bring you to tears.There is absolutely no good value comming from this movie.The whole movie is seen through a camcorder viewfinder, the the camera girlis very very very annoying....It made me very very happy to throw the disk in the garbage...as i donthave any enemies bad enought that i would give them this DVD."
"This is another hand held camera, so it must be real film. Two sisters are flying on New Year's eve from NY to LA. The younger sister Trish (Abigail Schrader) is filming everything which allows some minor character introduction. It was so authentic, it was boring. It just so happens there is a professional journalist on board with a powerful light so he can shoot video at night. His ability to hold the camera still leaves much to be desired.Once the plane crashes (description of film) one passenger Charley (Brendan Patrick Connor) provides for the internal conflict. There is a woman marshal on board (Everette Wallin) so there is someone with a gun. Fear and terror are generated by shaking the camera real fast and having everyone scream and shout at the same time. This worked better than the occasional glimpse of the rubber headed dinosaur looking predator.They crash in the land of &#34;it is always dark&#34; and they keep filming with a light that would attract predators. Everyone has various amounts of bright red blood on them.This movie reminded me of &#34;Chernobyl Diaries&#34; in its basic formula. What you thought about &#34;Chernobyl Diaries&#34; will determine if you like this one. I didn't like the &#34;Chernobyl Diaries.&#34;PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bombs, no sex, no nudity."
"Always hopeful when finding new critter films, I made the mistake of buying into this pile of crap. We all know the SYFY channel is continuing to crank out godawful, unoriginal trash with abandon but even this falls below their ""standards"". The creature ""effects"" may even have been lifted from an old SYFY flick - or a coloring book - not sure ...I gave it a star only because I couldn't submit a review otherwise. My hand shook with the torment of having to do so.Suffice to say, if I were on a desert island with a magical DVD player that worked without benefit of electricity or batteries and only this film to watch, I'd throw myself off the nearest cliff."
"It is a shame, very interesting topics, dumbed down to the lowest common denominator (a retarded grain of sand). Science is interesting, you don't have to create all of this fake drama, & use flashy editing techniques to try to make people think it is exciting."
"This show is a blatant rip off of Tosh.0. And this show is just not as funny personally. I could not get into it, his show with his bodyguard was probably the best. He has tried to branch off into too much and it just isn't as good."
"Opening credits lists an asylum in Washington State as the source and the date  of 11/6/89 of this patient breakout - sorry, despite the docudrama feel it never happened on that or any date and for that matter in any state. Our Belgium ""Tax Shelter for Films Investing"" studio must have played pin-the-tail-on-the-map as a site location for their fantasy tale. As for the script it's usually females that are picked by writers as victims who can only make dumb decisions while being implausibly ""no way out"" trapped by bad whatevers but in this case it's a rock band group (How could all of them have gotten the same cafeteria jobs at once?) having to defend themselves. The whole thing seemed contrived and as artificial as the blood. You have to be desperate to want to see red stuff (sort of since the lights were mostly out) to last through this one. The whole production seemed cheap. Must not be a lot of investors (they actually listed their names) seeking some tax sheltering."
"This is a badly made movie. Bad story, bad plot and terrible acting.It amazes me that movies this awful actually get made and distributed."
"Sometimes a bad movie is so bad it redeems it's self by just being campy fun.  This movie doesn't.  It's just bad in a boring, low budget way with no entertainment."
"Not worth a rental, not worth the time I spent watching it free as an Amazon Prime member. Just awful. Juvenile directing, poor cinematography..........just poor..........dreadfully poor"
I've been looking for a good standup comedian that knows how to deliver real laughs without making me cringe or change the channel for fear that someone (my grand kids) would see me laugh at crude humor.
I made it through about 15 minutes before giving up.  It just wasn't first rate material.  It seems that a lot of stuff on Amazon Prime could be described this way.
"Low budget film that is plagued by unoriginal scenarios, terrible effects, awful dialogue, and horrible acting...and not in a good way"
God please tell these film school pimps to quit making these awful clones.  It seems there is no end in sight of the film school rejects efforts at selling a product whose time has come and gone years and years ago!  Don't make any more!
The film makers really should stop watching reality TV and actually go to film school to learn how to make movies.
"I fell asleep twice while trying to watch this.  Honestly, this could have been done in one episode.  I can't think of a single highlight worth mentioning.  But I was curious about what Carole had done to her lips.  But if you are into whining...you will enjoy both episodes.  If you are into fakeness...you will enjoy Aviva in the reunion episodes.  I did however finally realize who Heather reminded me of...it has bothered me all season.  Her face is the spitting image of Lady Elaine Fairchilde from Mr. Rogers Neighborhood.  And that is pretty much it."
Missed the Grade and slid off the road. The writers must have been snowed in because is no longer worth watching.
"This episode is too depressing. 1 officer being assualted, ok possible. 2 officers goes directly to depressing. Sorry, un-beliveable and it takes drama and turns it into just a depressing episode. They should have written this better. This ruins drama by being too un-realistic."
"I was determined to make it to the end but I should not have been wanting the film to just be done.  The writer seems to have forgotten where the plot was supposed to go.  Scenes and actions and the choices that the characters make should be derived from the story's thesis---what was the writer's argument about life?  The writer knew the answers at the beginning and then forgot.I was bored throughout.  I got tired of staring at the main character's depressed and confused facial expressions.The main character had no direction in her life but plenty of commitment to self-centeredness.  Worst of all, I did not respect her.  Life just came along and pushed her into choices instead of her being a deliberate actor on her own behalf.  Who was she?  Where was her determination and sense of purpose?  And, finally, as far as the plot conclusion goes, where were the inevitable consequences for her lack of self-determination and purpose?"
"that marriage should be abandoned the second it feels ""incomplete"" for new lovers (who will surely feel ""incomplete"".)  Maybe this writer director was raped during childhood, slept with lots of losers, then everyone who could possibly advance her career, and is now a man hating lesbian with fantasies of retribution.  It's the most cynical movie I have ever seen bar none."
Really boring film with empty relationships and a very few interesting though strange moments. I think there might have been about 15 minutes total of mildly interesting content. Otherwise this film was a waste of time.
"This film lost me in the first 5 minutes, but I gave it a chance because I loved Michelle Williams in Dawson's Creek. This movie does nothing to showcase her amazing talent.  And her chemistry with Seth Rogen was non-existent.  Totally insipid movie."
It had a few jumpy moments but we never figured what the pact was and who made it. It just wasn't that good. The acting was sub par especially for who the actors were.
"This show is starting to loose its apeal to viewers. I have trouble getting through it, guess its hard to keep this series alive with new material."
"Staged, hokey and ridiculous.  For one thing, they repeat little segments so much each episode could be half the length.  The 70 lb snowmobile engine looks to be maybe 20 pounds.  Plus the guy seems ill prepared, and ill equipped.  Then you have the faux concern over the missing Montana guy.  His friend looks for him ""with concern growing with each step"", but when found the fellow is fine, just rambling around looking for otter sign with his dog.  He even asks, ""hey what brings you down here?""  Indeed, what brings us to find such garbage TV as an episode.  Then the guy in NC has his rifle misfire.  Well sorry, it didn't misfire, he missed.  Supposedly because bad help sighted in his rifle poorly.  Well excuse me, if your rifle and your deer are crucial to feeding yourself, sight it in yourself or at least oversee it being done.  What crap.  Plus, during this one deer hunt he has 3 different long barreled firearms.  The shot is taken with a Ruger #1, later he is seen with what looks like a shotgun, and in between a bolt action.  Truly disgusting crappy staged for TV made up melodrama from nothing."
"There is a great moment in this particular episode.There is a scene where one of the faux mountain men is working at his sawmill. They claim the sawmill is water powered. The whole premise of the show being that these ""mountain men"" are living a subsistance life in the hills by the old ways.Not only do they show that the generator is so small that it cannot possibly power the sawmill, they actually show the gasoline engine that does power the sawmill in the background. Its right there connected with belts to the sawmill.I know what reality television is. But when they give up the basics of even trying for a suspension of disbelief, its all just kind of sad. Their audience would not have thought any less of a guy running an old gas-powered sawmill and when people finally figure out that they are being treated like fools, they tend to all walk away at once."
"I didn't expect Jeremiah Johnson but this series is so staged that, to me, it's not watchable. Does a mountain man live in a two or three hundred thousand dollar house, travel on paved roads and get regular family visits? I wouldn't have thought so. There is only one of these men who resembles in the least how a mountain man would live. The rest are so faked it completely stultified my credulity. I don't recommend this series at all."
"I liked the first season of this series, it was somewhat original and quirky while being a bit stereo typed, the &#34;bad cop turned good&#34; and the &#34;conflicted girl with a heart of gold and a past&#34; set to a Miami Vice theme, alligators, Armani suits and bikinis. The second season wasn't bad, even though there was a strong sense of &#34;I've seen this before&#34; and the super hot woman police inspector/supervisor didn't work at all. By the third season this series has simply become an excuse to show hot girls in bikinis, there is no pretense of a story or anything resembling a mystery or a thriller. It's almost as if the writers got bored with it. Nicely produced, well filmed but the story got lost in a hot tub........."
"I really didn't enjoy this show much.  The scenery is beautiful, but the first episode pretty much scared me off of this show.  I would think they had fact-checkers or editors for some of the plot points, but they were missing in action."
"I was on this edge with this one. Main character mumbles a lot and hard to understand. This particular episode is Hollywood standard ""white man bad - Native American good""  tripe. Tiring. Another episode they let a bear go after it killed a guy. More Hollywood fantasy. A fed bear is dead bear unfortunately, no matter how nice it is. Improbable. I'm Sorry I paid for it."
"this is all i am going to write so take it or leave it! lllllllllssssssssaaaaaaaaaaakkkkkkkkjkkkrrrrrrrrrerrnnnnnnnnnnmmmmmmmmnmm nwhat happened to all the wholesome,oldies but goodies showes?"
I only watched two episode of this series.  It isn't a story type of show but just a lot of scattered things happening.  Someone may enjoy the shows but I would personally not recommend it to anyone.
"This cartoon is loud, obnoxious and lacks any educational value. I make my children turn it off when I'm around."
"I'm a spy movie fan and I'd like to go with the fantasy, but it's just too contrived. It's so predictable that it's not much fun."
"I did not like the film because the negative seemed to overpower everything else.  There are digusting, illicit, and unscrupulous things that take place.  See more at vyctorynotes dot blogspot dot com."
"I wish I hadn't wasted my money. I fine this series not funny at all. It's full of talk of oral sex and stupidity. If I could, I'd get my money back. Don't waste your time or money"
"Ha ha ha, this show is a filler of major turkey proportions. At least judging by this episode, in which Ozzy Osbourne's son (of all people) is trying to find a Skin-walker (a shape-shifting demon in Native American mythology), while some of his colleagues are on the lookout for the Ozark Howler, apparently a demon feline of some sort.Bad acting, extended scenes in complete darkness or the multi-coloured chaos of a thermal camera, and absolutely no action whatsoever - that seems to be the concept behind ""Haunted highway"". The investigators come across as super-gullible, at one point confusing the Ozark Howler (which is supposedly the size of a cougar) with a racoon or possum!Sure, it's an entertainment show, but I admit I wasn't. Entertained, that is. Judging by the Youtube comments, the average viewer of ""Haunted highway"" is a 15-year old sexually starved boy with a bad crush on Dana, Ozzy Junior's female (feline?) assistant. I admit *that* was pretty entertaining. And yes, it *is* somewhat strange that both Dana and Devin can keep their make-up on after two days chasing monsters in the wilderness...OK, let me guess. This show is...scripted?Sorry, this episode only gets one star - and I doubt the search for the El Dorado Hell Hounds or Louisiana Swamp Woman get much better than this. Besides, I doubt the Swamp Woman can beat Dana & Devin's make up, LOL.This is a real ""ghost turkey""."
It just wants so badly to be deadliest catch......and it is just so not deadliest catch. It doesn't take long for you to get REAL SICK AND TIRED of the same darn graphic of a tugboat sinking.*No tugboats or tugboat captains were harmed in the writing of this review.
"If I wanted to be lectured about the issues of the day I would turn on a police procedural. Entertain me, you are not social, political, economic masterminds. The crazy person being led around by a level headed and dedicated detective has been done before and that's okay but this offers nothing new. If you buy this season I'm sure part of the money will go to the construction of the temple of Obama."
It was silly Not a good story line. I could not get into the story. actors were not real enough to hold my interest.
Seriously if I want politics then I'll watch the news. This thing has way too much political undertones that are not even subtle to be likable. I'm used to some politics but this series reminds me of Cars 2 with its ham-fisted approach to political issues.
"It is bad enough that for a Monday night show, you have to wait until Wednesday night to get this, but then only 2 minutes!  Where is the rest?"
"What a great show this is. A great cast and a great premiss and it gets ruined because some network JERK doesnt care if he leaves people hanging at the end of a season .... no resolution in site. It makes watching the show a complete waste of time since it leaves you in limbo with no questions answered, and believe me, there are many , many questions left unanswered...the entire show becomes an enigma... this would be a 5 star show if it had anything close to an ending ...Boooooooooo!!!! Hissssssssssss!!!!"
I wanted this to download into the Kindles memory so my kid could play this show in the car while on long drives.  Unfortunately it won't play unless you're connected to the net.  Neither can I get a refund.  I'm not very happy.
"There is nothing in this even remotely appealing to kids under 5.  I have a 4 year old nephew and a 5 month old son, and neither looked at the show after the 2nd minute."
"So disappointing....I assume A LOT OF Talented people were involved in creating this show.You are stuck....walk into a door....run until you drop....but, don't continue until youshow us more then 'bonking' and loose zippers.  What happen to the original idea?  You havelost the mojo.  Hopefully you can pull it together."
"This is one of the most disappointing pilots for a TV show that I have ever seen. I couldn't even get past the first 8 minutes. Who is that horrible man playing Sigourney Weaver's husband? He's terrible! She was awful in the role. If that was supposed to be Hillary Clinton.........what a joke. Not even close and not even remotely similar to Bill Clinton.Terrible, terrible show! I am requesting a refund ($1.99)."
"I have been a big fan of this show and couldn't wait for the final season to come out on DVD.  I wonder if they had different writers for the final season, because most of the episodes seemed to be a typical formula show like most show on TV these days.  I especially hated the way the series ended and I am glad that it ended when it did, because I think a sixth season would have been a disaster!"
"This Australian film was written and directed by Jonathan Teplitzky and starring Matthew Goode.The film begins with a shot of Goode's agonizing face trying to get an erection while a topless woman looked on.The next scene shows Goode working in a restaurant kitchen barking orders.That scene jumps to Goode driving reckless in traffic and got hit by another car in slow motion and lost a lot of blood.Then the scene jumps back to the restaurant while Goode did all kinds of unthinkable things to a cooked duck just becausea customer wanted it more well-done.Afterwards we were introduced to Goode' ex(?)-wife and child then Goode destroyed a picnic just because a rugby player bumpedinto him.  Then someone was in the hospital(dying?) and tears were shed.I must admit that there were so many jump cuts from the 1st 30 mins that I could have missed mentioning some scenes and notremembered them in correct orders.What bothered me was not watching a man with all sorts of offensive behavior.  There were a lot in the movies.It was the annoying non-linear filming style of Jonathan Teplitzy that offended me.My question for Mr. Teplitzy is why can't he tell his story in straightforward format or not so recklessly non-linear?Filmmakers must understand that they are making films for the people who watch their films.Films are unlike novels which the creator can take some liberty in the narrative.Using non-linear filming style must have its justifications.The manner and style that Mr. Teplitzy used for this film are pretentious and maddening to say the least,and with that annoying piano soundtrack added to the fury.I could only endure 30 mins of this film and watched another DVD instead.I do not set high standards for watching movies and seldom do not watch them till the end."
"I've said it before, and, if RITES OF SPRINGS teaches me anything, it's that it often bears repeating: almost anyone with an idea can write and shoot a slasher/horror picture these days, AND almost any studio will distribute it.  The upside?  The market continues to be flooded with good and ... erm ... let's say ""less than good"" product, and that keeps the consumers coming back to the trough for yet another scare.  The downside?  Well, because the dynamics of producing even a modestly-thought-out idea, video store shelves are stacked with one forgettable piece of garbage after another.Don't say I didn't warn you.After killing a local businessman's wife, a group of entry-level kidnappers nab his tween daughter to hold for $1 million ransom.  Hiding out in an abandoned school, the team of criminals is surprised when a blood-stained young woman stumbles into their hidey-hole ... with a maniacal axe-wielding killer in pursuit!  Forced to team up for safety, the criminals and the young woman realize they're in the wrong place at the wrong time, and, unless they can cooperate, they're bound to become the lunatic's dinner ... or something.This is Dumb.  Yes, dumb.  With a capital `D.'(NOTE: unfortunately, there's no way to review RITES without some spoilers, folks.  So if you want to know my final rating, then jump down to the last two paragraphs.  However, if you're up for some laughs, then read on!)Writer/director Padraig Reynolds bears the distinction of shooting the most ill-prepared slasher script I've watched in decades.  To his credit, there's some mythology here - apparently, the `barn creature' feasts only on the heads of five female victims once every first day of Spring, hence the title - though it makes absolutely no sense.  See, he has a keeper who - for reasons never made clear - catches the women for him.  The `barn creature' can't do it himself (or herself?) because he's kept locked in the cellar of a barn (?!?!) for the rest of the year.Not only that, but also the monster apparently has a fetish for munching only the heads of beauty pageant queens or other reasonably hot-looking women, though (again) we're given no logical explanation for that, either.  Instead, each woman is hotter looking than the one before, and, no doubt, we can figure out the subsequent lookers' fates once we've seen `em.Not only that, but also this ritual - Reynolds calls them ""rites"" for a reason, kiddies - has been going on for 25 years ... and yet no one has ever come up with the idea to simply close shop, take your good-looking women and children, and leave town every March 21st in order to escape the ensuing annual bloodshed and mayhem.  Instead, the townies go about their business like nothing's ever happened, and you can what happens from there.Not only that, but these characters aren't fleshed out enough to be anything other than stock fodder for the maniac's blade of choice in a script desperately in need of going under the knife.  There's the bad criminal.  Then, there's the criminal with a heart of gold who only has to take the law into his own hands because he's $300,000 in debt.  There's that guy's good-looking girlfriend (can you guess her fate?).  Then there that guy's mistake-prone brother (can you guess his fate?).Not only that, but, technically, the film stinks of amateurism.  Here's a tip: when making a film with a handicam or steadycam or hand-held camera of any sort, it might actually serve the process to stand still every now and then.  I have nothing against the herky-jerky documentary look of filmmaking, but, when you do it in a slasher film, you're constantly giving the audience the impression that you're seeing things from the perspective of the killer.  When that ain't the case, you're confusing the story!  And to complicate matters further, the story goes from daylight to nighttime in the flick of a switch.  Literally!  Guy goes into the abandoned school, and it's bright daylight; guy runs from abandoned school only moments later, and it's the dark of night.  Really?  Plus, as long as I'm piling it on, do you know any abandoned and clearly condemned schoolhouses fully equipped with mood lighting only?  I mean, maybe that's the reason that the schoolhouse was condemned, after all.  The school district should be ashamed of itself.To the film's credit, it ends.  However, the way it ends, makes absolutely no sense, and I (seriously) laughed for about five minutes.  I guess when Padraig Reynolds says cut, his crew took him seriously.  Stay tuned after the credits, though, because there are a few seconds more that try to ratchet up a few more scares ... or was that a few more laughs?RITES OF SPRING is produced by IFC Midnight, Red Planet Entertainment and White Rock Lake Productions in association with Vigilante Entertainment.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group.  The disc looks and sounds about as well as any scream flick probably can and should - not a bad thing, just nothing all that special.  A few sequences were poorly miked, but, when you're making schlock-horror on a budget, you take what you get.  The disc comes with a commentary track and some pleasant enough behind-the-scenes materials, if you're inclined to check `em out.  Again, nothing special, but it's nice to see that the cast & crew put some thought into some aspects of their tale; it's just too bad it wasn't in the script.NOT REALLY RECOMMENDED unless you're a glutton for punishment or in the mood for a cheap laugh.  It isn't that RITES OF SPRING is poorly made.  To the contrary, the cast and crew do they best they can to muster a few scares along the way.  It's just that so little of the script makes any coherent sense.  It's as if writer/director Reynolds had an idea - one based on a regular diet of slash and gore - and then he ran with it.  And why not?  Horror pics of this nature nearly always turn a profit, if not a few stomachs.In the interests of fairness, the fine folks at MPI Media Group provided me with a DVD screener copy of RITES OF SPRING for the expressed purpose of completing this review."
"There is way too much of an emphasis on Juliette's woes this season. If she were at least a mimimally competent actress it might work, but she's limited to one -- count 'em, one -- facial expression, and that's it. Furthermore, her face screams COSMETIC SURGERY and she looks fake. Her nose is too pinched, her lips are over-botoxed, her hairline is receding, she has an overbite for Christ's sake, and her arms are fat and doughy. It's impossible to take her seriously or care what happens to her. Nick and the rest of the crew make the show worthwhile. They ought to get rid of Juliette."
have not reviewed season  2 am only in season 1 3rd episode and am enjoying it very much at this time.
"On the front of the box it shows the main character ""Nick"" swinging an axe but it never happens in the show.  There is no axe.  It's just a cheap marketing ploy.I wanted this show to be good but it is not. I saw season one and was bored and hoped it would get better but it never did.  Being a ""Grimm"" means you are related to the faerie tale author from long ago.  The only thing that separates a ""Grimm"" from a normal dude in the show is that they can see a wolf/ox/fly/lamb person and that's it.  Strangely this seems to terrify creatures that can shape shift, heal, jump ten feet in the air and have claws and teeth.  It makes no sense.  It's stupid.It makes no sense that the Grimms have not been all killed off by now.  They have a power that is problematic for beast people but not dangerous.  If you just look at the world like it is Grimms are no big deal but everyone seems to think they are because of the writing that has no basis on logic at all.(spoilers)OK well the whole Juliet amnesia thing gets dragged out more which is really really really boring.  Nick continues to act really wooden,  The partner who is a better actor does not get less air time than last season.  The Asian dude is still the plucky comic relief comic relief which is racist.  All the monsters are white people which is racist and their is a Mexican Banshee which is odd.The monsters are not all were farm animals this season which is better but actually less tied to actual Grimm faerie tales or legends of any kind.  I have no idea why the show is called Grimm.  I imagine there is a copy of Grimm's Faerie Tales in the studio but I'll bet it is dusty.There was a Minotaur (Greek) that turns into an Efreeti (Indian) but is played by an American white dude like 99% of every monster on the show, I mentioned the Mexican (Mexican/Spanish) Banshee (Irish), Naga (South Asian) biker dudes played by more American white dudes. Actually all the monsters are basically played by white people from America or Canada which makes no sense what so ever.None of the plot arks ever unfold into anything interesting.  This show is so boring and not connected to Grimm's Faerie tales at all. It should be called ""Were Farm Animals and Cops that Deal With Them"""
Did they just stop updating this series? there are way more episodes to this season than are available here on Amazon.
"Written by people who did not do their history homework and engaged by actors with just a modicum of ability, the show takes us 400 years back in time to another country where everyone speaks English and laundromats are as plentiful as Starbucks."
I really did not like this show at all.  I wanted to see what it was about and it really is about nothing.  I guess the money helps the family but the show is not interesting at all.  Like watching paint dry.
"I have to admit, I was curious about this show because I keep hearing so much about it.  It didn't seem like something I would like, but my husband and I decided to give it a shot.  We watched more than half of the first episode and finally had to turn it off and put ourselves out of our misery.  This show really is by, for, and about the lowest common denominator.  The producers are exploiting poor ignorant people, who in turn are exploiting their unremarkable and untalented little girl.  Do yourself a favor and watch something that makes you feel good about life and humanity.  This only made me feel disgusted as it showcases the worst in the human race."
"terrible horrible movie, no fx, no good pic, no good view, nothing, bunch of good actors after get high decide to do a terrible horrible movie ...this is a low cheap budget movie...stay away..so bad, bad director, bad producer, really this is a vomit of movie..stay away..do not buy, do not rent, do not copy, bad movie"
"Too bloody, violent and there was nudity and explicit sex scenes in the first five minutes......Not my type of entertainment...at all.  It was not evident that this was in the show by reading the synopsis or I wouldn't have rented it."
"Definitely the worst TV show out there. Don't believe the reviews. I wanted to like this. It seemed like it would be absolutely amazing. I thought this show would be an accurate depiction of police back in the mid-19th century. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the black medical examiner working like Dexter trying to figure out how the girl died in the first episode. I had remembered what I had read about detective techniques in 1880's London. They basically did nothing that was shown on the show, and this takes place in the 1860's. Other things just made me roll my eyes. It reminded me of how lazy Detroit 187 was. They hired Michael Imperioli to play a detective in Detroit and even had him asking his coworkers if they wanted to get a slice. Facepalm! Seems the show was probably originally set in New Yawk and no one bothered to adjust the dialogue, or even try.Mercifully, I quit this show before they brought up anything about Shake Shack or Iphones. What a load of wasted potential."
I did not watch much of this as i felt it was not worth my time. Not a good choice.
"I'm sorry if this is nit-picky, but NO respectable lady would allow herself to be in the same room, let alone the same house, as a prostitute, and no respectable gentleman would allow his wife to stay in that room/house. I don't care if the owner of the house thought it was okay or not, his guests would have left as soon as the ""ho"" walked in. This was the Victorian period...ladies did NOT mingle with prostitutes. Do the writers seriously not know this??? I thought this show was trying to be historically accurate.And the women's dresses in this episode were atrocious. I noticed how ugly they were in previous episodes, but I was willing to overlook that, until this episode. A very recent widow--who should still be in mourning, I don't care who she thinks she is, or how open-minded she is--would NEVER show herself in public in a WHITE ballgown! Are you kidding me???  Who is the costumer on this show? Not only was it white, but it looked like a wedding gown...HELLO!!  Again, who is dressing these people?!! I guess I'm just used to the higher quality and attention to detail I see on other BBC shows like Downton Abbey, for example. I've never seen such deplorable costumes on a BBC show in this century! And don't try to argue there was a war going on. This was the North, and these people are supposed to be VERY wealthy. They can afford the best silks and satins, etc. So the women should be dressed to fit their station. They don't seem to have a problem dressing the wh@res to look like wh@res...why can't they dress the upper class characters correctly?I could have overlooked these seemingly minor details except it seems as if great pains have been taken with the rest of the show to make it as accurate as possible, so the whole costume debacle is just sad, bad, and beyond my comprehension.Then there's the awful acting, that I won't even go into.The first several episodes were interesting, but once the bad acting became too much to bear any longer, and the hideous costumes made my eyes bleed with their ugliness, I had to stop watching. If this show gets another season, I hope they get a bigger budget and can afford some better costumes and more talented actors."
"How could the BBC and HBO do such a poor job?  The true grit and integrity of performances we've come to expect from both British television and HBO was utterly lacking.  What was Levinson thinking?  We can usually count on him, too."
"This film got rave reviews but don't believe any of them, it's just horrendous. You won't get past the first 5 minutes."
"I have no idea what happened to my life.  Time just got sucked out of me and I have no good an happy feeling, or deep and meaningful reflection, out my wasted time.  I guess I am just not as deep as the people who attend film festivals..."
I've always enjoyed her as an actress and was surprised at her rendition of this detective who seems to have replaced Kyra Sedgwick in what seems to be a new rendition of &#34;Closer.&#34;  I cannot bear to watch her in this so I only watched the first episode.
"Don't know where to begin.  Story was loose, characters not believable, relationship to boy hooker domineering, and just...wish I hadn't paid the two bucks to see it."
"What a mess. First-time feature director and screenwriter Leslye Headland goes for the jugular in this 2012 black comedy which takes the same cues as 2011's megahitBridesmaidsdoes but frankly doesn't take them far enough to be remotely funny. In fact, I laughed only once during the film's 91-minute running time (it was the line about Michael Jackson). That's too bad because producers Will Ferrell and Adam McKay were able to recruit a first-class cast and then unfortunately lets Headland flounder with a predictably belabored situation, leaden pacing, and gags that are overly deliberate in execution. The threadbare plot focuses on a dysfunctional trio of obnoxious girlfriends who gather together &agrave; laThe Hangoverfor a hedonistic night of celebration before their friend's big wedding. The bride-to-be is Becky, a former geek whom the trio viciously called ""Pig Face"" in high school behind her back. Now hitting thirty and finding their lives disappointing to say the least, the girlfriends are horrified to be beaten to the altar by someone they treated as a mascot to make themselves feel better.The alpha leader is Regan, the overachieving maid of honor known appropriately as the Hannibal Lecter of bridesmaids. Although resentful of Becky's happiness, she is determined to make sure the wedding goes off without a hitch, a challenge given that she inadvertently ripped Becky's wedding dress during a drunken binge with bubble-headed Katie and perennial party girl Gena. The three women desperately figure out how to fix the dress in the middle of the night as they cavort with the various groomsmen out on their own bachelor party. So many moments ring false including the set-up and the lightning-flash changes in the characters just to service the plot, but at least the cast is game. Fresh from playing the understandably depressed bride inMelancholia, Kirsten Dunst appears to savor her mean-girl turn as Regan with surprising acuity and fearlessness. I give her credit for not being afraid to come across as unlikeable. Playing a more extreme version of the obsessed sister she played inWedding Crashers, Isla Fisher plays Katie with nervy comic abandon and obviously reflects her husband Sacha Baron Cohen's go-for-broke influence.Starting with a scene on a plane with Horatio Sanz as she graphically describes how she gauges a certain act, Lizzy Caplan gets to play Gena as the tough-talking chick still aching for the boyfriend who abandoned her when she became pregnant. Adam Scott plays the boyfriend in his typically smarmy manner, while James Marsden gets to play his cynical character in the same vein as Regan's foil. I was surprised to see Andrew Rannells, star of Broadway'sThe Book of Mormon, play Katie's flamboyant co-worker and the party stripper. Rebel Wilson, who played Kristen Wiig's brain-dead roommate inBridesmaids, has to play straight woman this time to the nasty trio as poor Becky, though she gets to have a few choice comic moments in the home stretch. Speaking of which, Headland cuts a lot of corners in the third act in a last-ditch effort to deepen the characters. It doesn't really work since any goodwill the movie generated had long since evaporated by then. It's no wonder this movie has shown up on Amazon Instant Video and Video on Demand a month before its theatrical release since word-of-mouth will likely sink the film's chances at the box office. At least at home, the producers have gullible viewers like me who were willing to give it a try without leaving the couch, a big mistake on my part."
"This movie has several quality actresses and a promising premise. The trailer suggested a funny movie similar to Bridesmaids, which I loved, so I was really looking forward to watching this. Unfortunately, the jokes fell flat and the characters were catty and unlikeable. The language was foul, the bridesmaids were awful to the bride, and there was cavalier treatment of near-lethal drug use. I just didn't find it funny. I can't recommend this movie at all, but if you are looking for a funny film, I can recommend Bridesmaids."
"I do not get the point of this movie. It was not funny or sexy, the soundtrack was ok, but the story-line was depressing. If I had friends like these I wouldn't invite them over for dinner never mind a wedding."
"It was ::sad:: chaotic, stupid without sense , total garbage and waste of time , not funny at all , the beginning started well good but then it turn into garbage"
"This movie had such great potential. It features a powerhouse cast, including Kirsten Dunst, Rebel Wilson, Isla Fisher, and many other fairly well known actors/comedians. Sadly, the contents of the movie were more dismal than anything.If I had to sum up this movie, I would say it is a combination of the Hangover and American Pie minus the laughs. A pack of girlfriends from high school are reunited when one of them is engaged to be married (Rebel Wilson). Most of the story centers around the hours, and events, leading up to the wedding.The problems I had with this movie are many. First of all, Rebel Wilson, arguably the funniest of the bunch, is absent throughout roughly 90% of the movie. Maybe they should have had her switch roles with one of the other ladies and improvise a bit. Could have helped things ALOT! And I noticed they gave Horatio Sans a credit in the movie on the Amazon listing. He was in it for roughly a minute. It was much more a cameo than anything else.They joke around about doing coke. I'm rarely ever a fan of a movie that shows people using hard drugs, especially when they do not show the repercussions of such actions. This movie pokes fun of it! Truly poor taste!The three main characters are extremely flawed and do not learn from their behaviors. One is addicted to coke, one is a hardcore partier, and the third is a jealous type A personality with body issues. Despite all of their bad decisions and the horrible outcomes, at the end of the movie it isn't clear if any of them learned anything. The only one who might have learned something was the coke addict, but even this seemed unclear. To make matters worse, the hardcore partier almost dies from an overdose and they gloss over this fact. Seriously!? It seemed like the perfect point for her to turn her life around for the better. This movie missed a golden opportunity.Where does that leave this movie? Not funny with hardcore drug usage and characters who do not learn anything from their experience. In my opinion, this makes the movie a definite pass. You won't be missing anything, trust me!"
"Happened upon this on Netflix. Thrilled that I didn't pay money for this - and I can't believe there are actually 5 star reviews here. This movie has no point - is not funny, and I can't believe I watched it until the end. None of the characters are remotely likeable, and the 'bridesmaids' (supposedly friends of the bride?) are horrible to her. Don't waste your time, even if it's free."
"Predictable, terrible plot and I just want to slap all the characters except the lady who plays the bride.  I do not recommend it at all and I didn't find it funny."
"This is an ad for the upcoming season. As an ad it does not really work for me since I see nothing new in the up coming season to make me want to pay for the next few episodes. I like the Dr but I am going to wait 6 months for it to show on Netflix. Also, charging me 99cents for three minutes has made me an angry viewer. Only for the new Canadian Primeval would I pay that......rip off!"
"The Mindy Project is a ""comedy"" I don't find it funny when a successful doctor acts like an insecurity teenager.  ""Mindy"" may have graduated medical school and practices medicine but is a ""project"" because she isn't in a relationship. This show sends a horrible message to young women."
"Mindy is to be commended for having enough sense to finally leave The Office. She should also be among the first against the wall when the artisan revolution rolls around. This show offers nothing new, no unique viewpoints, no relevant voice, and is an overall let down. Quite honestly, we had expected better of her and have been once more taught to expect nothing out of anyone in the business for the money and not for the art. She could have been a truly unique stand out, instead we get a clone of a clone of a clone of...you get the point. Save the IQ points, watch Victorious or Icarly instead...at least they are trying."
It was not what I expected and narration was boring. I could hardly stay connected and was glad when it was over.
Contrived chemistryContained cinematographyConcealed ActingWhere's the Epic?A waste of time ... why are there so many versions of this classic - no one gets it right?
"But I suppose this is great for tween girls. Or something. I was quite surprised at the general tackiness of the production value, the cheesy opening titles, and the poor quality of the writing."
This is a mediocre and boring show.The characters have no nuance and the actors are not helping.This is a shame.  The subject is timely and engaging.I had high hopes for this series but this is no Will and Grace.Alas.
"The story is lame, the filming endeavored to make this seem &#34;campy&#34; made me sea sick instead.  Come on the movies made using this style understood that at some point the camera has to stop shaking....  And the story, well honestly ordinary trash."
"what is wrong with these people, you can check this movie in Netflix, I do not recommend this movie, terrible and cheap low budget movie"
"Disclaimer: this review contains the *OPINIONS* of the reviewer.I'd been hoping for more with this, and I felt like my expectations got shot down.To start off, I'll say what I didn't like the most about this: the lack of any trace of a comprehensive story. What we have are a bunch of middle-aged guys (it's never revealed, but you get the sense they're anarchists) who, recorded (possibly accidentally) over one's own personal sex tape, record their own dangerous misdeeds (including a force flash of a young lady). Well, after a brief discussion on how they get money on a porn site for every time they get a flash recorded, one of them tells the group how they can get more money than they could imagine from finding one certain tape. What's on the tape? Why's it worth so much? Who's paying for it? Those and other questions get asked, but no real answers are given.What trace of a storyline there is in the central story, there's little more than that in each ministory. Honestly, it felt like the dialogue in each story had been crafted by college kids that didn't care about coming up with an intelligent (let alone intelligible) storyline, they just wrote what they felt like then added special effects to make it all fit. Not only excessive swearing (already making it too much like today's American horror rather than a substantial foreign horror movie), but also (in most cases) having excessive nudity (I think they only added horror elements to keep it from being labeled as ""porn""), it already made me anxious to actually want something substantial.Well, I would rate something like this 1/2 a star rather than none at all simply for nostalgia (they did get V/H/S technicalities and tape quirks right, I'll give them that), but I'll slightly further than that. Another 1/2 star for one segment that included a decent special effect that did impress me. The forest segment where the killer couldn't be clearly seen due to being glitched out (not only visually, but also the sound was glitched to add to the atmosphere). Beyond that, all the other special effects I couldn't pretend to have the heart to enjoy.Maybe there's a chance the sequel, S-V/H/S, will be any better?"
"The hand held video as movie concept should have died with Blair Witch, but it must be cheaper to put together nonsense like this rather than take the time to craft a really good anthology series. Don't get me wrong. There are some good ideas that could work in the hands of better directors and writers.  Getting past the first 15 (eternity) minutes to try to set up this movie is the real torture.  If it wasn't on NetFlix (which has become the dumping ground for bad movies), I would have quit watching.  But since I could simply leave it running while catching up with the local news, I allowed it to continue.  If you really want to know what happens in this movie (with all ""spoilers""), go to the Wikipedia listing ([...]).  The listing is like a movie trailer.  Believe me, all the good parts are in the synopsis and you don't need to waste time watching this movie. If you do watch it, use the Wiki listing to find out exactly what's going on.  Oh, I know there are some reviewers here who think this is high art and the future of horror.  Don't believe it.  You want a good anthology?  Go view Hammers' ""Dr. Terror House of Horrors"". There you'll find good acting and good stories.  The only horrors in VHS are the directing, acting, and writing.  And you know VHS 2 is just around the corner."
I rented this because Ti West was involved and I have loved his films thusfar.  House of The Devil and Innkeepers especially.  His short film in this about the people on their honeymoon was actually pretty solid.  The remainder of them were straight up craptastic.  I paid $8 to rent this because I was so excited to see it months before it came out.  I actually turned it off before finishing it.  I would not even be willing to rewatch this for $0.  My friend bought it (he is bummed by the mistake) so I ended up finishing it a couple of months later thinking that maybe I was just in a bad mood or something...nope...hated it!
"This was a horrible waste of $9.99 for a ""pre-theatrical"" rental.  If this movie ever comes out in a theater, I'd be quite shocked more by that than anything in the movie.It was so stupid and poorly done on all levels, that I watched most of it on FF just to get through it in case somehow all this tied together with something more than the ending it did have.As someone else aptly put in the title of their review...""This movie sucks"".  I agree.But to each their own.I've seen several posts praising this movie for being ""daring"", ""innovative"", ""superb"" even.  Did we watch the same movie?!?!  Wow!Now THAT would be a terrific gimmick...Different movies all under the same title, and a random pick by a computer which one you actually get to see.  This way you'd have to find out how many different ones there are, and then hope you rent enough times to see them all.  I'm fairly certain the movie ""Clue"" did something like this in the theaters each having different endings of ""whodunit"".  The DVD shows all the endings the movie actually had.  Now that was a well done fun movie based off of a fun board game.There ya have it...simple and to the point.  Let's see how many call me names for writing this review?I guess based on those other reviews we'll all just have to wait until Hollywood finds a well-written horror comic book to make into the next awesome movie.  Why not do a GOOD Vampirella movie since we've got the whole supernatural being thing going hot & heavy with True Blood, Supernatural, The Vampire Diaries, etc., etc.  The original was terrible, but it is a cult classic.  Just sayin'..."
"I really could not watch.  Not my kind of movie.  It must be some sort of reality based film, couldn't get through more than five minutes."
"I've heard some good reviews from other sites about this movie..that is why I got the time to watch it and judge it my self. Well, from my point of view, this movie has:- Few new elements (at least for me).- Fair scattered scares (jumps) in different portions (different stories!!) of this movie.- Majority of acting is fair but not good.- Some scares are of the type that can creeps you out.- Lot of unnecessary elements and scenes that got me bored.In overall I didn't like this movie because I got bored as there is no build up of story maybe some people can see it but I couldn't. Maybe because of that ..I couldn't get scared into the level I expected (I expected it from the reviews I heard!).It is a &#34;watch once&#34; movie for me."
"The newest episode aired over a week ago, but its still not on Amazon! I paid for the whole season & even sent them a complaint but nothing has happened...guess amazon just dropped the ball on this one...why am I paying for this again? I can just go watch it on some other site for free without the waiting around!"
"This is another fake reality show. The cast is made up of human train wrecks who long ago left the Amish community pretending to be innocents encountering the outside world. We have the typical collection of drunks, wifebeaters, petty criminals and losers that can be found anywhere.Putting the fake elements and the fraud of the show aside, the only thing of value here is that it seems a certain percentage of humans, no matter where they come from or how they are raised, are trash. Even though its a fake show, the really awful nature of each of their personalities comes out. The show might have been better called ""becoming trailer trash""."
"Every episode not only manages to disgrace this brand name but actually make seasons 1 through 5 worse, somehow. After seeing this season, I want to forget about the entire series and that's a shame, I recall truly enjoying the awkward Michael seasons. As for the actor who plays Andy, his absence at least made the show tolerable. Upon his return in this episode thoughts of blinding myself and bursting my eardrums became preferable to finishing the episode with his talentless non-portrayal of a character that has no aspirations beyond being overlooked, unfortunately thanks to the horrific brand of ""look-at-me-I-didn't-get-enough-love-from-mommy-as-a-child"" acting, we can not simply ignore Andy. Never underestimate the ambitions of individuals for attention and money to ruin art. Please cancel it now, we don't need an ending or series finale to this any more than we need a resolution to any rotting roadkill corpse in the middle of the interstate."
"Worryingly misleading about cancer treatment realities.  Three observations:First: no doc would allow someone who needed surgery as urgently as the Parenthood character is alleged to have needed it to wait for weeks to have the surgery.  It's called 'malpractice,' and for good reason: if a cancer is thought to be so urgent as to require surgery, it's medically ill-advised to wait.Second:  no one who has been through chemo is doing splits at a bar a few weeks later.  Or only BEGINNING to lose a little hair.  Someone who has been through chemo is obviously and visibly pale, weak, and bruised, and looses hair (if she is going to) much more dramatically.Third: going through surgery, chemo, and radiation--which the Parenthood character is alleged to have to go through--takes an enormous toll.  Most people--even young, otherwise healthy, and clearly very affluent--people who have been down that path LOOK it, for months, and possibly forever, moreover, since you are leaving with a weakened immune system after cancer treatment, you are much more vulnerable.It's a huge disservice to the many women (and some men!) who have gone through breast cancer treatment to make it look as manageable as the show does. Even when there are not emergencies--as often there are not--cancer treatment is a slog, a struggle, and it marks you for life.I understand that television glamorizes/misrepresents most of the difficult things in life. Pretend that the characters could afford to live as lavishly as they do in Berkeley  (if the parents' house/compound were in Berkeley--which is it not--it would be worth many millions of dollars).  Pretend that normal working people and parents have the sort of time and money to do overnights in expensive hotels, wear fabulous clothes, constantly have parties with snazzy gifts, etc.  That's just standard Hollywood fare; no one is really fooled.But DO NOT MISREPRESENT WHAT CANCER TREATMENT REQUIRES, or WHAT IT IS LIKE TO GO THROUGH/HAVE GONE THROUGH IT.  That's just irresponsible."
"never seen this before ordering it and it was very dumb,i wouldnt recommend it to anybody because its very stupid."
"warning warning this VHS movie is a homemade vhs recorded, cheap cheap I don't know how they make it..5 retard white dudes get lost in the country side...well this is a bad really bad movie..this is the one of the worst movies I ever seen in my short life ))))))) stay away, don't rent don't buy don't see, do not try to see in Netflix stay away...."
"It's hard to think of anything innovative these days. Especially if you had to judge the horror media today through this film.5 friends on a road trip? Check.Come across creepy places? Check.Ignoring a grave warning? Check.Constantly swear like your whole vocabulary has no words beyond 2 syllables? Check.Oh, and one of THE most annoying cliches: overt predictability.The shortest amount of time I had to be able to predict anything was around ten seconds. Either I've watched too many horror movies of this sort or... wait. Maybe that's it.This is supposed to be IFC, yet it feels like Hollywood- meaning it feels cookie-cutter in its setup, premise, and execution (pun intended).There may have been one or two scenes that got me to jump, but The Grudge was better at getting me to really JUMP, not just have a small jumpstart. Not to mention the main character seemed to not know (at first) how to use his camera for anything more than to try to make a sex video with his girlfriend (believe it or not, filmmakers out there, not ALL men are sex animals, some actually respect women as women and not sex toys). He and the rest do seem to present the one thing that's almost convincing me to stop watching indie horror: no real aspect of hope of getting out alive, but pulling the same mistakes the kids in the previous horror film you watched make and getting offed in the process.The decisions these kids made made me think they were kindergarten dropouts rather than try to convince they had a brain at all. Not to mention the video itself, though described in the beginning to be top-of-the-line in all its features, kept having cliched glitches yet no explanation as to why they kept happening (I doubt cameras detect human tension and therefore constantly screw up their own quality in the process).I hope IFC doesn't keep letting people repeat this type of movie mistake."
"this was quite possibly the most annoying movie ever.""Dumb"" is too smart for this movie!This movie makes the Blair Witch look like a 5 star movie!I actually wanted to put my head through a wall- that's how stupid this movie is!80% of the movie is a camera being dragged through brush and trees.worst script logic ever! IT MADE NO SENSE!  nothing was even remotely realistic or logical!If this was a film about how to make the worst decisions ever while being hunted by a murderer- then it's the best movie ever! lolThis movie was so bad it's hard to give examples- I'm so sorry.I will never watch a movie by this director ever again.I'm sorry that I sound like a broken record... it's just I can't believe how gawd awful this film was!"
This movie was horrible. If you are a fan of horror films skip it brcause you are noy missing much.
"Justin (Victor Zinck Jr.) gets a camera for his birthday from his girlfriend Brook (Mittita Barber) and immediately goes into little boy mode. They go on a trip to ""the cabin"" with another couple Kirk (Aslam Husain) and Amanda (Chelsey Reist). Amanda's sister Danielle (Christie Burke) tags along as the moody ""whatever"" girl.The first half of the film takes place in the car. We are filled with the ""Turn the camera off!"" and ""Okay it's off"" stupidity. They detour to a place called the Crowsnest to get half priced beer only to be harassed by slashers in a travel trailer for the second half of the film during which we see film footage of trees and ferns.This is a lousy ""kids in the woods"" film made worse with terrible found footage and a bad script. If you are going to skip one found footage film this year, I think you found it.Parental Guide F-bomb. Brief Nudity (Mittita Barber). Near sex."
"I abandoned watching this. I tried. As soon as the young girl cozied up to the John Krasinski character, I gave it up. It wasn't  going anywhere to begin with and now it was just trash."
Seven dollars to rent a movie?  You could buy a DVD for $7 easily.  This is a rip off.  I watched this movie but found it horrible because the price was so high.
"Terrible movie, no redeeming qualities, turned it off without finishing. Cannot understand who would give 4 stars, not any good"
This show was two hours of my life that i will never get back. I kept watching thinking that surly the main character would grow a spine and kick his abusive toxic family to the side..but no! He just keeps coming back for more with that sad puppy look in his eye. I found myself yelling insults at his family for him. I would steer clear of this one.
This was quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen  and I very much regret spending the money for it. I had high hopes for it because of the actors involved but we stopped watching because of how totally stupid it was.  It was a total waste of money and time.  It was just unbelievably bad.
"This movie needs to &#34;Take a HIKE&#34; right on out duh Amazon instant video section, and never come back....it is plain out too bad to even explain why...."
"Not overly impressed with the show -- it's just like every other Hoarder show. Some a little more disgusting than others. Pick those ones for the shock value only.Here's how it goes:&#34;People who hoard have issues and they usually wait until it's so far gone that they a) are getting evicted by their landlord or b) the county has deemed the house/apartment/trailer uninhabitable.&#34; That's the message through and through.The hoarder always has some reason for their behavior  and of course is reluctant to make any changes -- this goes on for at least a half hour. There is a crazy family dynamic going on where family members are estranged from the hoarder, mad as can be and &#34;don't want nothing to do&#34; with the hoarder. They all haven't spoken for a long time.  Soooo,  bring in some specialist in the psychological issues of hoarding (really? there is such a thing? Well, now apparantly there IS! What an idiot job... sorry about wasting your perfectly good educationon a TV show. Probably getting paid great and it serves your ego oh-so-well to be the 'expert')Then the &#34;clean up crew&#34; (who look and sound like they are always advertising their services) show up and make predictible  comments on the mess of it all. Then they done protective gear and start the clean up job.There might be a crisis moment at the point the clean up is underway. Of course, there is a serious time crunch of like, oh... say: 48 hours. It's so serious at this point, because the hoarder was so reluctant for months, years... whatever... but no matter....the hoarder starts freaking out and has second thoughts about getting rid of some piece of cardboard or the bucket of poop (seriously, this was in one of the episodes I watched!!) and everything halts while the family gets ticked off again, walks out, vowing that they are DONE with this nonsense. Bring in that specialist and have a come-to-reason meeting.... on we go with the clean up.Everything turns out good in the end. Or maybe not. To be honest, I watched two shows and just ended up feeling disgusted that main stream entertainment has turned into such a freak show. It must be the &#34;train wreck&#34; mentally.And there are SEVERAL shows like this -- some are &#34;Extreme Hoarder&#34; shows and some are &#34;Just Hoarder&#34; shows. It should just be a matter of time before the &#34;Relapsed Hoarder&#34; show is on the air.Hey, I want the rights for THAT brilliant idea."
If you are extremely bored this is the show for you. People like this should be sent to a mental institution
"There is nothing whatsoever sexy about a nearly sixty year old slut with a hotel blanket showing her wrinkley upper arms, shoulders, and neck. Sutter is overexposing Sagal and making her looks and behavior grotesque. An elderly whore is not an interesting character. Then she gets loaded and wrecks her car with her grandchildren in it. The strong matriarch has lost her throne and turned into a nauseating loser. That's not a character study, that is not character development, that is just plain character assassination."
"This is crazy.  In reading other reveiws, I see that you guys are not giving those of us who have a ""TV Pass"", a full episode to watch, instead many have viewed a version that is missing some scenes.  That sucks!  But at least they got to watch SOMETHING.  Now it says there is NO version available for me to watch at all!  I must agree with the others who are upset about this. I have a ""TV Pass"" for several shows currently.  If this isn't resolved soon, I may just pull all of them AND my ""Prime"" acct. Unacceptable Amazon!.....Here I am at 3:00 p.m., on THURSDAY and this  episode is STILL UNAVAILABLE!!,...Just about reached my limit in dealing with this issue...I spend a BUTTLOAD of money here, every week, on videos and T.V. shows, I want this fixed NOW!!..Or me and my money are done with you  inept fools"
"I want my money back! I DID NOT PAY FOR 16 seconds of commercials before the show or 2 min of commercials after! Your commercials eat up the limited internet usage that I have way out here in the country. I DID love amazon vidoes when it first came out and I have been a VERY loyal customer, and how have I gotten re-paid? By Amazon sneaking in commercials that I DON'T WANT TO WATCH and I PAID so that I would not have to watch!!!! STOP the commercials or start loosing customers!!!"
Another dumb comedy about teens and high school . Not funny and the music is awful and sounds like its from rejects from American Idol or The Voice .
"I could only stand to watch this movie about 15 minutes.  I came close to watching a major league baseball game as an alternative, and that's a sad statement.  no really worth even 1-star."
"I had high hopes for this movie based on some of the other reviews and the fact that I like Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon. Unfortunately, there were few redeeming qualities about this movie and their acting wasn't among them.The storyline fell flat, the acting was shallow, and Richard Gere's character was a total A-hole. Didn't care what happened to him at all. And it turns out that his wife, played by Susan Sarandon, was just as bad. She really didn't care what he did or how he did it as long as he didn't bring his problems ""to their doorstep"" or get their daughter in trouble (the daughter was the firm's CFO).The entire film felt like a made for TV movie, not a national theater release. Actually, it felt like a Lifetime channel made for TV movie!The only redeeming character was the young man who begrudgingly helped Gere's character. He was the only one who had a heart and deserved leniency. He and maybe Gere's daughter.The kicker for me though, was that the movie was so poorly done that they put Susan Sarandon in a cheap prom-like gown to go to a charity ball. Now, keep in mind that Sarandon and Gere's characters are multi-millionaires in their mid-50s. So why in the world would she be in an ill-fitting ugly cheap dress that looked like a 1980s prom gown?Why do I care about the dress? Because it just highlighted the fact that the writers and directors did not pay attention to small details that would have made this film more believable and more worth watching. As it is, Arbitrage was a thrill-less drama with a stupid ending that should have left me wondering what would happen to Gere's character. Instead, I was left wondering why in the world I wasted my time and money on this ridiculous movie."
"We did not think this was Gere's career-high.  Sarandon, usually wonderful, didn't have enough to do and appeared to phone this in. Big waste of money - don't fall for the great reviews."
I thought it would be like most of his movies; action-packed and fast-moving with a lot complicated scenes to figure out. I was very disappointed. The concept would have been ideal but the movies started too slow for me so I move on to another more interesting movie.
I kind of lived this life so I hated this movie although I like Richard Gere.  Reminded me too much of the arrogance and selfishness of this kind of man and of the woman willing to go along with it.
Ending ruined the whole movie. What was that? It's like they got bored with their own story and just gave up. Bummer.
annoying. 1 yr old did not like it compared to other shows like curious george and bubble guppies... . .
WHY am I paying to watch commercials both before & after the show?! Iam NOT going to continue paying for these shows with commercials! I have a very limited amount of internet and these stupid commercials take up a valued portion! STOP MAKING US PAY FOR COMMERICIALS!!!!
I am very upset with amazon. I bought this and was unable to view it on my amazon fire. I tried contacting them 3 times nothing was resolved and I did not get my money back. Finally I tried my computer it worked but I did not buy it to watch on my computer. Now I hesitate to buy videos from axon knowing they may not be playable on my amazon fire
"This show is one of the best Bones has produced, but I have to complain that I bought this video for my library and it came with commercials for the channel that airs it.  What???  I shouldn't have to watch commercials on videos I bought.  That is so incredibly LOW.  This is my last purchase for a wonderful show on a terrible channel.  It starts AND ends with commercials.  If you can figure out a way to strip them out, please share."
Seriously. We buy these to avoid commercials if fox continues this we will stop buying these videos. Want to test us? Keep the commercials and watch your revenue fall.Update 4/2/2013Since Fox has refused to stop the commercials I have cancelled this season and will not buy any more seasons of Bones. If this persists I will subsequently start cancelling / not renew all of my Fox shows. There are plenty of providers who don't put commercials in videos I pay for so I will not stand for having commercials impressed upon me.
It sucked as a movie. The sound was scratching in spots well a lot of spots but I don't think that is Amazons fault. Withing minute from the start you knew the entire movie before it happened.
"hahahahahhahhaah  this movie is EXACTLY like it's name... H-O-L-L-O-W...  Oh gosh, this was bad, really bad!  Save yourself; don't even think about pushing play.  Ha!"
"Hollow (Michael Axelgaard, 2011)Sometimes, during those brief moments of lucidity when my head clears a little and I can step back from the Netflix Instant queue, I ask myself why it is I continue to watch movies in subgenres that were played out before they even got popular. I never come up with a good answer to the question (and I'm never lucid long enough to go digging, really). Case in point: the found-footage film, an offpsring of the mockumentary that is, ultimately, an offshoot of the popularity of 1999's The Blair Witch Project. I've seen maybe a half-dozen found-footage films I would consider watching a second time; I've seen maybe one hundred found footage films overall. Hollow is not only not one of the half-dozen, it's a movie I would consider using as an instrument of torture were I a guard at the Salt Pit. Pointless, plotless, presumably scriptless nonsense that almost dares the viewer to keep watching to see how much worse things are going to get. Guess what? The answer is &#8220;a lot&#8221;.Plot: Two couples are on vacation on the English moors. Okay, maybe not moors. But that sound spookier. It's actually quite dry for England. And maybe not vacation, either; they've come to sort out a dead relative's estate. Dead relative is a priest, and estate is... an old abbey? I think it was an old abbey. While they're on their way there, they pass a big old gnarled tree, and Emma (Emily Plumtree in her first feature appearance) relates the story of how the tree is possessed blah blah. Emma, her beau James (The Task's Sam Stockman), and their pals Lynne (Get Him to the Greek's Jessica Ellerby) and Scott (Devil's Pass' Matt Stokoe&#8212;no relation to the writer, at least I fervently hope not), arrive at the old pile and spend a few entirely uninteresting days trying to keep a clich&eacute;d script afloat (predictable sexual tension between non-couple pieces, growing obsession with the tree, things that go bump in the night) before, of course, they must all go confront the tree and find out if it's really possessed or if the scriptwriters were just ripping off The Blair Witch Project.You get all the usual lowlights from a movie like this, people running around and screaming incoherently, usually off-camera, while something that you never quite get to see is chasing them. Now, I am a big, big fan of not revealing the monster; the one scene I didn't like in Cloverfield (and yes, I do realize I am the only person who really liked that movie, shut up about it) is the one Big Reveal scene at the end that's there solely to stop the masses complaining that you never get to see the monster. (Compare with the excellent scene in Val Lewton's Cat People in Central Park, where you get a few glimpses of shadow at best; it is a textbook in how to create suspense.) So when I'm complaining about it, you know you've got problems. Much of the problem has to do with the fact that, during the action scenes, we're not really seeing much of the characters, either; Axelgaard seems to have decided that the movie would be more suspenseful if you couldn't see the characters or the thing chasing them. Not a bad experiment, but he probably should have changed direction once he realized how incredibly stupid it ends up looking. You, too, would be better served by avoiding such. (zero)"
This is one of the worst foreign films of the year in my opinion. Definitely skip it cause there are much better ones out there to be viewed.
"Fox accepting this series is a total waste. Another medical drama mixed with espionage and a female lead taking over and stuff (boring), yet I am glad it received a proper series finale."
"actually, the beginning of prom, already shipping water (why is it that the rest of the planet is unaware of the cool cave paintings, why was there no debate about the wisdom of unleashing an expedition into deep space, with such slight consideration of consequences, why wasn't the crew prepped for at least months prior to takeoff, instead of receiving a 15 minute briefing after arrival, and where is the rest of the goddamned crew?  ad nauseum.  still, it was about the only coherent segment of the thing, and seemed promising, even after excusing the instantaneous fast forward from cave to space...a VERY bad sign.  when this prick tease of a film wasn't straining itself disfigured to ""strand"" in alien elements (obviously, in order to pull in the same alien fanboys who will never stop insisting this debacle was a perfected meisterwerk...oh, yes, and to jam theatres with them), it was failing incessantly to either develop characters or sustain logic. already forced to forgive a lame beginning, i was entirely unable to locate a coherent middle or ending of a film that had been ridleyed to death with (here it comes) plot holes, and meaningless ""clues"", a la lindelof.  no story, no logic, no thanks.  i see he has actually made an emblem of the one serious mar he forced upon bladerunner, which would be the assinine intercalation of the unicorn puzzle dream.  once again, deckard's partner could have shared an interest in them for far too many reasons.  ""take that, you vulgarian fools!"" would be the meaning of that pathetic gesture, so very characteristic of ridley in a snit.  fine.  take THIS, you pompous twit: i couldn't care less where this doomed attempt to force meaning on prom I leads.  been lead down that path one too many times.  even for an egomaniac, did you really think i would be willing to WAIT for a story to happen, one movie too late?  you keep it."
"Like most other reviews here I loved the premiere, but every episode since has just gotten worse.This last episode ""Another Fine Navy Day"" was the worst yet. Seemed to me it was more like a stalling tactic - that the writers didn't know where to take the show - so they just drugged everyone and we have to sit through 45 minutes of stupid hallucinations that simply annoyed me. I found myself fast forewarding through parts I was so disappointed.The writers had better get on the ball with the next episode or risk losing more and more viewers."
Bad show. Not sure why this was made.  It is sort of like the book &#34;on the beach&#34; but not good. It was cancelled quick which should tell you all you need to know
"WTH Writers? Are you trying to tank the series? This was actually a shocker series for me, episode one was a hit, the episodes after are typical but all still pretty good. And then.... ""Another Fine Navy Day"". In this episode we take action drama, adrenaline, guy show and cuddle it a little, make some very feminine slow, shocking day time soap opera drama. Maybe to attract more women? I am not sure, whatever it is, if you follow this with the same kind of trash, you will likely tank this series very quickly. It's as if the writers took a break and the overly effeminate romance novel day dreaming secretary got to change the pace and twists in the show. Sure it was going in the same direction, it isn't the story exactly that has changed, it is how it is being delivered. This episode was so bad. You were doing so well, don't do this again, or you will find it hard to get another season."
"If amazon would allow less than one star, this would be one of those films (film being very loosely, and I mean VERY, used in this review. Yes, I know this was a ""short"").I read this synopsis: A fairy tale for adults about a little boy who has to gain strength and courage, to find his way out of a mysterious place by making the ultimate sacrifice.The synopsis was absolute nonsense and ABSOLUTE BS, designed to get someone to watch this drivel.Yeah, I thought this might be cool to see, considering it was about 20 mins. I was wrong. Incomprehensible, lackluster, disjointed. Just a lame 'crossing over after death' story. Hard to follow, and contrary to what others have said, I cannot imagine how dull and pedantic it could be if the story was 'fleshed out'. I would place this on the list of ""high school media: the early years""- if it was imaginative. This ""short"" was short of story, sense, imagination, and anything else that would make it worthwhile to even watch."
"Looking at other people's reviews I'm clearly in a minority. After all, what could possibly be more wholesome than yet another TV series in which the good guys blast away at all & sundry with a never-ending stream of Hollywood rounds (the sort that keep on coming long after the magazine is empty...)? Best of all, we don't need to feel even a pinch of remorse because - now this is the Really Good Part, honest - the victims are already dead! What could be better than that?? Needless to say the acting is average, the script is wooden, the plot is essentially non-existent, and the verisimilitude likewise missing in action.But, if you are in need of an effective diet plan then apparently being turned into a zombie is just what you are looking for, because although the series is set in & around Atlanta GA where 86% of the population is either fat or morbidly obese, everyone in this series is straight out of Central Casting Los Angeles. Realistically this show ought to be about The Waddling Dead but here in TV land being a zombie means you're pretty darn lean. Not that it matters - gore is gore, blood is blood, and in the end they're all just targets. Remarkably, whereas in the real world people have to train extensively to manage head shots with any degree of consistency even against static targets, here even kids can make special-forces style shots with total accuracy. No one ever gets hit by blue-on-blue, there's never a negligent discharge, and the concept of a ricochet is entirely alien.In other words it's basically boring repetitive mindless violence for the over-two crowd. Presumably the series appeals to couch potatoes who simply haven't anything better to do with their lives. As for me, enough is more than enough. This is tedious and violent rubbish - the mental equivalent of eating junk food. Avoid at all costs."
"Every Monday after a new episode, it's the same old thing. ""cannot connect""  Can't leave feedback. Can't download. It might be easier to just pay for the cable and watch it on AMC, and get rid of Prime, and quit PAYING for episodes that cannot be streamed or downloaded on MONDAY."
"At the end of Season 2, the most fascinating heroine appeared.  I couldn't wait for S3!  And what did that do?  Strip her of everything fascinating about her and turned her into a broody background victim.  BLECK!!!  And what did they give us instead?  A whole lot of blood and gore.  WHAT A MISSED OPPORTUNITY.  I tried to like S3, but it just got more and more pathetic and I really lost respect for the creators of this show."
This is what we waited for? What a major disappointment ! This is one chapter you can save your money on and you wont miss a thing
I believe I was looking for another movie title and wasn't sure what a friend of mine was  watching.  This definitely was not the movie I wanted to watch.
1 escapism? no2 boring dialog yes3 whiny characters that don't react with anything like realism? yep4 evil white men and mindless hicss vs women and minorities? yep5 any sense of danger from zombies no6 plot with no coherence? yep7 enjoyable at all? naaaa
"Episode 16, ""Welcome to the tombs"", shows us how far this series has sunk, from what used to be hilarious, grisly, suspenseful, and original. Now we have the worst horror-movie cliche, a ""heroine"" who will be fine if she just hurries up, but she takes her time to indulge in maudlin dramatics and gets...eaten. We don't care about Andrea anyway, because Laurie Holden's trout pout is too hard to look at, and her character's predicaments are all the result of simple stupidity: she just can't see that the Governor is a homicidal sociopath, even though it's obvious to everyone else. We, the audience, keep seeing things before she does, and then we're supposed to endure her endless obtuseness and still cheer for her! In this latest example, Andrea is locked and bound in a room with Milton, the Governor's assistant who is about to die and turn, and then will try to eat Andrea. Milton, still barely alive, urges Andrea to hurry up and use the pliers he left at her feet to free herself, so she can mercy-kill him and escape, before the Governor returns with his strike force. There is every reason here for extreme speed. Death sits across the room from her and the Governor cannot be far behind. Never was it more important to keep one's mind on the task at hand (freeing oneself) and get the hell out of dodge. All Andrea has to do is hurry. But she indulges in long, tragic looks, tries to philosophize with Milton, forms dreamily optimistic facial expressions, and thus fritters away the time she needs to survive. So of course, Zombie Milton gets her. But there is no meaning to it, because she LET it happen! Then we have some more drawn-out tragic posturing when Rick and the gang arrive to find her all bitten open and about to die. Sad music, long stares, reverence. And we're supposed to see her as the ""Noble Soul who only wanted people to live"". Walking Dead is starting to get Smallville Disease, where the characters spend all their time bloviating about the Deep Inspiring Meaning of what is happening, but there is no story. Someone needs to reboot this series."
"This has become a soap opera more for 10 year olds with all their love of horror, blood, and gore. The first season was good, but from the second season on...it has sunk so low there is no saving it now. I've cancelled the rest of the season and won't be watching any further. What a disappointment for something that could have gone a whole nother way and been really great."
"Andrea and Michonne are not that interesting anyway ... and the governor and his group are unlikeable. If they have too many shows focused on this group, they're going to lose me ... and I was a serious fan!"
"If you do not have ovaries, you will completely miss any appeal this show has, and I hope you are only watching it to get into the pants of someone with ovaries who happens to be a fan. Completely from the female point of view, this show does nothing more than highlight to the rest of the world that ""men"" in America are nothing more than feminized ideals brought about by our guilt that we are somehow responsible for women not having penises. It is a complete failure even in its attempts mock itself. The actors are all on their way out of the Hollywood meat-grinder and they know it and are not afraid to let the desperation seep into their performances. You'd just as well watch several Old Navy commercials back to back, at least then you might see some celebs of note."
"The show should have only ran 6 seasons. After the sixth season the shows writing and acting seemed forced. The jokes were old, and the show is just terrible. The seventh season was slow, but season 8 was terrible. I am going to stop watching after this season."
"Now, I'm going to admit I thought the show was pretty funny when it first came on. But midway through the fist season, the child actors started to get on my nerves, they wernt acting like kids, they were acting like snotty adults. I stopped watching for a while, then I caught a couple reruns on USA Network, the new baby is just awful and annoying. And one thing that bothers me is that they completely ignore the cameras. I know they aren't suppose to act like the cameras are around in a documentary, but its not like a movie theater will allow a camera crew in a movie theater with copyrighted stuff in it? just come on"
I actually stopped watching this show. I was so tired of them trying to shove the gay part down my thought. It was a pretty funny show in the first and second seasons. A friend told me to give this episode a try. This is probably one of the funnier ones in a LONG time. Still this show has tanked a lot.
"None of it is Amazons fault, just a real bad movie. Had a good story line they could have done so much more."
"Sad attempt at humor. Poor acting to boot. Why is this a popular series? There is sooo much TV that is good, why does this get good ratings??!!"
This show needs to be cancelled... it's not even funny anymore.  Ashton is an idiot... really can't stand that guy.
"yeah okay so maybe they will eventually tell us what happened out in the woods after the plane crash, but they are taking too long, and in the meantime, the stories are boring and non-existent.  I suppose it's to keep us watching, but it's disappointing.  How did they stay warm, given the fact that they used their last match?  and how did they get food?  What about the pilot- he couldn't have stayed strapped in his seat for a week!  and how did they keep Arizona's leg from bleeding out?  Cristina mentioned once that animals were coming for Lexie, but how did they keep the animals away from her?  I've loved this show from the beginning, but this season is one HUGE letdown so far.  At the very least, they should give us interesting story lines if nothing else.  I'm guessing it's going to end very badly, like too many good TV shows do.I can't stand how they just keep showing us tiny snippets of the crash without any explanations."
"Well, the acting is great and the characters are very interesting but it's one of those shows where the longer I watched it the more I felt as if I were doing something I shouldn't. I realize there is adultery and there are dirty politics but it just isn't something I want to fill my brain with and call it entertainment."
"Mundane, pedestrian, intellectually insulting. These are all things that Elementary wishes it could rise to the level of. It is too clearly gimmicky to be effectively a gimmick. A disappointment on every level and an insult to any actual Holmes fans. This so far removed from the greatness of the BBC series Sherlock that I  don't think it deserves to inhabit the same universe. The rest of the world must watch elementary and think it was intended for mentally challenged pre-schoolers. If your IQ is below 95, this program no doubt keeps you guessing, but then so would Sesame Street. If you like watching Lucy Liu disprove that Asian women are ageless in appearance, tune in. If you want to be entertained, buy paint...watch it dry."
"The actor portraying Holmes is about the most annoying person I have had the unfortunate experience of having to listen to...if that makes sense.I would rather rather lose toenails, one-at-a-time to Moriarty than listen/watch Holmes."
"To me, this episode seems to take everything wrong with Fringe and pack it into one, plodding, tedious and at times, deeply annoying script.  Walter Bishop is at his most annoying and boring.  Peter and Olivia are weak and ineffective. The big reveal takes so long and, really, in the end, so little is revealed, you just want it to be over.  With respect to Walter Bishop's acid trip?  Trust me, there is nothing more boring than someone else's acid trip. Walter's acid trip is no exception. I think Disney should sue them for using a very recognizably disneyesque animated fairy. And then there's the Monte Python animation sequence.Aimless, drawn out plot developments. Everything that usually makes a Fringe episode exciting or interesting is eliminated. It's claustrophobic. Absolutely minimal forward plot movement. Forgettable dialogue. No suspense.  One scene of pointless and unconvincing violence. Utter absence of interesting supportive characters. Rehash upon rehash. No new ideas - zero. Utter lack of wit or humor. And on and on. And the director seems to take delight in sapping whatever life there is in this sorry script with excruciatingly slow pacing.  Everything that can be wrong with a TV episode is wrong with this one. It's enough to make you dread the next episode.  Right now, it looks like the season is going nowhere.  Or the show's creators have no idea what to do with the plot and don't really seem to care."
"I totally loved this show in the first two seasons... then I sloughed through BORING season 3... got better in season 4, and I started dreading the end of the show this season.  The season started out a little boring, but it got better quickly.  I put off watching the last 2 episodes because I was dreading the fact that it was going to be over.  I waited so long that I was able to watch the last 2 episodes back-to-back, fortunately!  The 2nd to last ep. was amazing, and the last one started out that way, too. But - and I won't give anything away, it ended VERY badly.  Too many shows end badly, but generally it's because they didn't know they were going to end.  THIS show knew it was ending, and they could have done a much better job of it for sure.  IMHO, the last episode ruined the show for me.  It was so disappointing that now I don't even care that the show ended, and that is just sad.  It's better for shows to go out on a high note so that people will miss the show, not be happy it's over.  Shoot."
"I can't believe I forced myself to finish the first season's 13 shows.  I think it was the fascination of just how terrible this series is in so many ways that it's amazing and drove me here to write a review.  Where to begin?  How about the cast and acting?  Where in h#@@ (pun intended) did they get these actors from - some community college acting class?  Except for Terry O', the acting was beyond awful.  And so badly cast that it made me laugh out loud several times.  Then there's the writing; wow, I don't recall hearing such mundane lines in a long time.  Actors walk into a room several times and ask, &#34;What are you doing?&#34;  What are you watching?&#34;  Are you kidding me?  There's no other way to evoke curiosity?  The sets were so fake, it was fascinating.  And if you are going to use CGI badly, don't use it at all.  The plot, at times, held promise, but that quickly disintegrated in a series of laughable twists.  Honestly, I got so many laughs from this series, so it  wasn't a complete waste of time."
Ok so I had to update all of my blu ray players just to get the disc to work. It still won't work on my Sony blu ray player. No idea why. I don't want to spend fifty dollars on it at a store to try a different one when I waited over a week for it to arrive after I preordered it a month early. This is not how I saw my bday gift to my husband going. Thanks for making it a lame gift. So upset!
So dark and depressing. Awful because of the rampant promiscuity as well. Your all going to get vd and stds.
"I watched this show, right up until Phil's interview with GQ. How can anyone, ANYONE, claim that African Americans were &#34;happy, happy, happy&#34; under the Jim Crow laws? How can anyone, ANYONE, be so hateful about people who identify as LGBT? I will never watch again. Feel free to hate on this review. Just because some people agree with him doesn't make it right."
"The pilot episode is funny because its audacious and over-the-top redneckery, but shortly thereafter it becomes a droll, uninteresting show about this stupid family of fakes pretending to be beverly hillbilly like backwoodsmen, new to fame and fortune because of a popular duck call, having fun in their hemi trucks and shiny new carharrrrrrt attire.  I would have a real problem with the publicly bigotted statements if it weren't simply a pandering to an audience of morbidly obese neckertown walmartians and a  false flag of 'any-publicity-even-negative-is-publicity-nonetheless' as a dubious means to perpetuate a WELL overplayed merchandising campaign at Walmart that is as stupid as the people who buy into it."
poor little millionaires making even more money on the idiots that care about duck dynasty's daily lives!  reality TV is the worst!
"They are wealthy fakes pretending to be good old boys.  Cops was an excellent reality show because it was not fake!  Now they make fake junk like this and call it reality, but this has nothing to do with reality.  It's amazing how the sheep suck up this BS.  Also, the claim about them being religious is perverted version of religion.  The story goes that God created man in his own image.  Not in any bible does it say &#34;white&#34; men only, so how can racist bigots like these guys be considered religious?  It's completely FAKE garbage!"
Do not believe all the rave reviews.  They're  all from family members and die hard fans who don't want to see these bird killers go.  It's time to close the curtains on this lame show already.
"Don't waste your time on this movie. The first 40 minutes of it is about stupid kids and their crappy life, parties and other B.S. The rest of it (until the titles start rolling) is based on a very bad plot, with unlikable actors, and average special effects made with nowadays available for everybody, programs. The after titles last minute of the movie was without any scare or whatsoever. Don't believe what the trailer or the cover says. It is NOT! twice as scary as the first movie. It is far worse! I was bored through all of it! Stupid, pathetic, shameless movie! That is all I have to say. Nice attempt to make money! Now I would like to get payed for watching this garbage!"
"(Warning, this review contains some spoilers)I thought the first would help the producers realize their mistakes and improve on them. Fat chance.The initial shot has people raving about Grave Encounters and going loco about how good or bad it was and how some were convinced it really was real. One such raving fan goes to an alcohol-steeped party and (eventually) reveals that he's a @#%^#@$ visionary. My thought on that was ""Sure you're a visionary. I don't get your vision, though.""His plan is to provide evidence that Grave Encounters was the true deal. Problem is... his obsession with the ""proof"" leads to problems with his girlfriend, friends, and, really, his whole life situation it seems. Between his own filmmaking (you're given snippets of his film, which is nothing but predictable shot after predictable shot) and finding what he needs, he's really letting himself loose on his psychosis.Just like in the first film, this goes to show you NEED to know how to make your ghost effects realistic. There was one singular shot where a creepy ghost did send chills down my spine. Then the ghost moved. End of the fear and the beginning of my eyes rolling.If there's anything I can say this movie did that did get my interest, it was the use of multiple types of cameras (iPhone, professional camera, B/W silent-era camera, etc.) to tell the story from different types of angles and get a sense of realism.The other was the return of a certain character from the first movie. Out of all the actors in this movie, his was hands-down the most believable. Pure craziness, from the shocking reveal to his last moment.Unfortunately, afterwards, it's all hedonism at its most horrorific. And it quickly got as disinteresting, bland, 1-dimensional, lackluster boring as it had been. Even when a cleaning lady is passing by the ghost hunting team, I'm quite certain the team didn't notice the look she gave them, which tipped off that something was going to happen. Before the elevator doors opened, I (unfortunately again) could predict what would happen. It defied physics, but it couldn't defy predictability? When will filmmakers today learn?Overall, despite the nice maneuver of using multiple cameras to some advantage and one character being believably looney, I only give this 1/5."
"I absolutely loved GRAVE ENCOUNTERS. I would place it high in the ranks of my films that came out the year it was released and include it in my list of top notch horror films of all times. For me it hit every note exactly right. Not so with the follow up film which fails more often than it succeeds, the usual problem with most sequels.If you haven't seen the original it revolves around a ghost hunters' type program that we find is more staged than reality. In that film the terror rises when they discover that the ghost are indeed real and that they prevent the crew from ever leaving unless they're placed in a body bag. It offered some truly scary moments and a general sense of unease that prevailed from start to finish.The reason for its failure can be seen in the majority of the opening sequence which takes up perhaps the first half of the film. Instead of a professional crew we have a student film maker who along with his friends spends most of his time getting drunk and trying to have sex. When he begins to look into the disappearance of the original crew he eventually talks his group into seeking out the abandoned hospital and investigating it on their own. The problem is that the majority of film time here involves them partying and swearing like sailors as opposed to furthering the story along. The whole opening segment feels like wasted film and time and something to just fill out the story instead of add to it.When the group finally gets to the hospital they're confronted by a guard who prevents them from entering. But this is a determined group and they eventually find their way in. When the guard enters to pull them out things begin to happen starting with the guard's death. Frightened and unable to leave, the group searches for a way out just like their predecessors did. It's not until later in the film that they stumble across the sole survivor of the original film, the host of the show, who has been trapped here for years. Can they escape with his help even though he hasn't been able to all this time?That's the sort of stupid question that comes up in this film. The scares that we see are this time around more predictable than the first time even though there are some creepy moments to be seen. But the sense of discovery found the first time around is lacking this time and the whole initial sequences do nothing but make you want to reach for the fast forward button rather than wait until something happens.I don't think I can even give this film an A for effort since it seems like so little effort went into making this a good picture. It feels like someone realized they had a cult hit on their hands and decided to keep the ball rolling rather than take the time to add something to the story. Sure the part with the old host adds something but at the sake of dead air time (no pun intended) prior it isn't worth it. Sorry but I can't recommend this movie to anyone, including fans of the first film."
This movie is really bad.  Not funny in the least.  A total waste of time. So sorry I rented it.
"Extremely poorly written. I found the jokes more disturbing then sad as the movie progressed. This is a very adult film, not something any age kid should be watching. From the hardcore porn playing in the backround, to the full frontal nudity. Somehow watching a old guy getting blown up with all the kids watching was supposed to be funny.I found my self feeling bad for the kids being in a film like this.They take the shock value we see in movies like, wedding crashers oldschool and dodgeball. Then they put it in a movie with a bunch of little kids. Instead of adding in some funny inendo, or word plays, like the other films. They show hardcore porn, nudity, and really disturbing behavior.There is a line between funny, and WTF. They stayed firmly on the WTF side the entire film."
"i never seen this before ordering it and i watched it when i recieved it and it wasnt all that,i wouldnt recommend it at all.its not good"
"Paid $9.99 to rent this primarily based on the two really glowing reviews left on here by people who called this the best movie they'd seen in a while etc.  Beware:  I think those reviewers might be marketing people working for the studio that put this out.I really like psychological thrillers, mysteries, horror, etc.  I like Selma Blair as well.  I had no expectations of what this movie was or what it could be, but I took a chance on it and wish I could get a refund.  It was terrible.  There's no real mystery to this as you should be able to figure out what happens in the first ten minutes.  It's very obvious what's going on.The first 30 minutes or so are somewhat interesting, as this uncomfortable feeling builds at a dinner party that only one side of the table wanted to happen...and then you start to wonder how the other people are going to get out of the bad situation.  I laughed because it reminded me a little of holiday meals with relatives I don't like and who I wish would leave...but they can't take the hint.By the 46 minute mark I just gave up on the movie and realized this was one I'd have to sit through and endure until it was over because I spent the $9.99 on it and I just can't turn it off and not see the rest of it.This is the kind of movie that ends up playing very late at night on a random cable channel and is only watched by people who have nothing else to do and can't get to sleep.  I would never recommend this to anyone...definitely don't waste money on it and don't believe the reviewers who are giving it 5-stars and saying it is the best thing ever.I fell for that scam this time.  I saw two glowing reviews and one bad one and I thought the person who wrote the bad review was wrong...but now I have to side with that person because this movie stunk."
"One of the many, many, far too many spin-offs of the Blair Witch Boondoggle!  This one starts out better and with more good moments of human interest.  But, and this is where the film school crap takes over: just turns into a bloody gorefest with no plot, meaning, conclusion or plot to make it into a cogent whole with a real plausible story-line.  Next, I suppose will be the take-off on teh Todd Sees case which has so many nuances, that it would make a great movie if handled right!"
"Terrible acting, and quality is very low on the camera work. If you have prime it;s free so you can see for yourself."
This movie was soooooo awful and the pitiful attempt to be blair witch was sickening. Maybe come up with something original.
I usually like the paranormal shows but this one was just bad.  The Wraith how bad can an interview be?  The whole story and the acting was very much lacking in everything.  Definitely not worth spending time watching and I want my 1.99 back.  This is the first time I really disliked something bad enough to write a negative review.  Don't waste time...there are much better shows out there.
"Gossip Girl has grown up and with those crucial scandalous high school years behind her, cannot make the translation into adulthood (or what approximates it on this show.)  Salacious has turned to sleaze and the bad girls aren't really clever, just mean.  All of the conniving has worn thin and while earlier seasons seemed like underhanded moral plays in pretty cloths, this episode reeks of ugly."
Boring and dry. characters did not entice me to continue to watch this program. I find that British shows can be really good or boring.
"A guy gets back from 5 years stranded on an island, and he says to his sister, ""you were there the whole time?"" Don't wait until the 7th episode to figure out this is a dumb chick-flick. Crappy acting, cookie-cutter cliches and nonsensical plot."
"All I can say is that this show was extremely boring. It was too much like Dark Angel. When you think of Beauty and the Beast, you think of a beast, not some governmental experiment gone wrong."
"Horrible acting, LAME concept. Utterly disappointed! I barely made it through 3 shows without poking my eyes out! Don't bother watching."
"Same story as many others.  Damsel meets danger, is rescued by dashing monster person, damsel falls madly in love- pining away for years until she finds.  Did not appreciate this in any way. Although I am sure some school age girls might appreciate it."
"Very disappointing episode that totally lacks what made the show funny. The writing was very poor, and the failed attempt to be funny was all put into the plot.  Comedy is always funniest when it's character driven as much of the earlier episodes are. In addition to the poor writing, the episode is dragged down by the dead weight that goes by the name of DeVito.  Compare any episode of Season 1 (which was blessedly DeVito-free) to any subsequent episode you wish and the season 1 episode comes out on top. The cast (minus Dead Weight DeVito) is extremely talented and their creation of season 1 was fresh with a Gen-X sarcasm, and consistently laugh out loud funny. In that first year, Glenn Howerton can make you laugh with a mere look in close up. But with season two came the addition of Dead Weight Devito, whose comedy is tired old-school broad sitcom comedy. It doesn't match the sensibility of the other four actors or their characters and the longer the series went on with DeVito, the more it sunk towards his sitcom level. This episode hits that rock bottom."
I watched the whole season and wished I hadn't. The mom drama is disgusting and judges are idiotic. Robin Antin comparing everything to her Pussycat Dolls franchise was laughable. She mentioned it in almost every critique of a dancer when the kids on the show were already more talented than that group that no one has heard of anymore.
"I was very disappointed to learn this was a History Channel documentary praising the lords of industry and finance.  I should have been more careful to read the product description before I purchased it, but was expecting a good and possibly realistic drama about the period of Reconstruction and Redemption and what the average citizen experienced post Civil War."
"I am unable to rate this program. It looks like a very good program, one worth watching but I did not."
"I watched and enjoyed season 1 for a lot of the same reasons others did.  I expected more of the same this season.  I made it through three episodes and stopped.  It is a non-stop series of scenes depicting humiliation, gratuitous cruelty and violence, outright torture, sadism, bondage and obedience, degrading and violent sexuality, simple ghoulishness, and on and on. I find nothing redeeming in this series. There is nothing in it I would call a plot or a narrative arc or character development.  Any more than there is in your average porno production.  Just a pretext for more ""torture porn.""There is no wit or humor or depth or insight, either.  It is just relentlessly and oppressively cruel.The fact that it has so many positive reviews tells me that it has found a cult following - not that it actually deserves positive reviews.I think the actors in this series are not only wasted. I think they are degrading themselves and damaging their reputations by participating in the project. I will never be able to watch Jessica Lang, James Cromwell, Evan Peters or any of the other actors without unfortunate flashbacks to this series. Unfortunately, I used to enjoy these and other artists connected with the series. I wish I had never purchased the first episode. At least then I wouldn't have these awful associations tainting my memories of these actors."
I got lost somewhere. Did not understand the connection between beginning and ending. I do not want to watch any more episodes.
"I am a HUGE fan of AHS season 1 and it is with sadness I can't say the same about Asylum.  When I realized what the creators were going to do with each season, I thought it was risky but brilliant.  I loved the idea; so I waited with anticipation for Asylum to start...they even have the actor from Babe...well know and uber talented added to the cast this year.  Zachary Quinto and Jessica Lange and Evan Peters back...I was SO stoked...then I watched it.  I tried, tried SO hard to love it like I did season one...but I just can't.  It isn't that there is too much going on...I don't like torture porn.  I find it trite and unnecessary.  So for those reasons I am out.  Here's hoping season 3, if there is one, is more along the lines of true horror instead of just horrific."
I enjoyed the first season of this show but this one about a Catholic run asylum I just couldn't stomach enough to even get past the third show.if next season is anything like this one count out this viewer.
I didn't like it at all.  The same characters are used as in the first season playing different parts.  I didn't find it interesting but more on the bizarre & weird side.  There was no &#34;tie in&#34; into the first season's parts played by the same actors like I had hoped.  The writers are borrowing from aliens to &#34;Snake Pit&#34; to Hitler's reign with no continuity.
Violent and heartless.  No storyline that I can tell except how brutel can people be to each other. Don't buy.
"I liked last years series, spooky and kept it interesting. This year they went wacko with the writing. It is disgusting and downright gross. Glad I didn't purchase the whole season! I love suspense, but not the sadistic torture, it lost the story line & focuses on cutting people up for fun. Really sad that this show has 5 star comments.  I cant watch people abusing, torturing & cutting their limbs off people. It's sick & very disturbing!"
"The UNcensored NC-17 version of Universal Soldier - Day of Reckoning is an above average sci-fi/action movie, nowhere near as good as its predecessor Regeneration, though. However despite the director's promise that the uncensored version will be released for home media this is not the case here. I don't buy INCOMPLETE movies, so I'm not buying Day of Reckoning until they correct this mistake!By the way, don't expect to see too much of Jean-Claude Van Damme or Dolph Lundgren in this one! They're only in it for a few minutes."
I tried to like this movie but couldn't. Too much non-sensical violence and so many stone faces you think they filmed this thing on a really grimy Easter Island. Jean Claude looks desperate as if going through the motions and Dolph looks like he hates being in this mess. Someone needs to tell the makers of this movie arty shots do not make up for a turgid plot.
"Universal Solider 1 set up that the army found a way to reanimate a corpse and control it. So they thought. Things go a bit iffy when two of them begin to regain their memories and recall they have unfinished business with each other. The second was a mega flop, where Luc Devenroe or whoever it is Van Damme plays is pretty much back to normal and helping to stop the worlds worst wrestler ever from taking over the Universal Soldier army. Part 3 was a blur. I just remember thinking it had nothing to do with the original film, it just brought two characters back.Now a 4th installment. Now Luc is the bad guy? Dolph Lungren is back, after being killed how many times now? And they work together? Lungren takes orders from Van Damm? WTF??? A new guy with Van Dam moves is the new good guy? Who wrote this? And have they even seen the original movies?Had this movie NOT been in the Universal Soldier name, it probably would have been passed off as maybe 2 and a half stars... but to take the original hero, and turn him into the villain? It's just dumb. It's like making a sequel to a popular hero movie and for no reason at all, suddenly Martin Riggs is a terrorist, Axel Foley is a drug lord, Rocky has become a Russian fighter, Cameron Poe has become a mafia boss... it just makes no sense."
"How do you mess up this opportunity!?!  Both original stars.  Some great MMA talent.  And you dump them into THIS slow, dull, depressing, confusing story!?!The best way I can describe this movie is that it plays out like some half-formed story idea dunked into the dream of a drugged mental patient.  Just when it seems to make sense and promise something good, it flops and drags and makes no sense.If you can even FINISH this terrible movie, you either fell asleep and woke up at the end or have a will of steel.It does no justice to the original movie, nor the tepid sequels.  The good guy is now evil.  The evil guy is now  . . . good?The action is lukewarm, shot poorly, and uninteresting.Wasted talent.  Wasted time.AVOID."
This movie circa 1950 is poorly done by today's standards.Plot is not believable not at all realistic.Some bigger names in the cast but acting is poor.I do not recommend this movie.
"not a very good film. low budget, poor script, mediocre acting,mediocre action scenes, mediocre all around. I like well made war films. this one doesn't come close."
"I don't understand other reviews, this is a 0 star movie, but I had to put 1.  The acting is bad, what happens in the story is bad (at leaast 1 stupid decision by every character in the movie that make you go ""oh, come on"").This might just be the worst movie I've ever seen."
"I decided to pay $4 because Entertainment Weekly gave this movie an A. But I was sorely disappointed. It's a crap movie. And Amazon's video quality was horrifying. I've watched a few other things on Amazon Prime and had no trouble, but this was a mess, tech-wise."
"Movie consists of 50% showing a face in front of a hand held camera boringly telling some story that would make any UFO, paranormal, zombie, Bigfoot, government conspiracy freak as satisfied as a plate load of bbcue wings in the belly. Another 25% is repeatedly showing old news footage of random, and over the years, dead herd, flock, schooling critters meant to strike fear in all whose education ended in the fifth grade. The final 25% is just some made up stuff."
"The word SLOW, takes on a new meaning with this ...docu pretender video, it moves so slow it seems to be going backwards in time. Imagine an amateur with a video camera taping an amateur unsure of what she is going to say and saying it very slowly and seemingly considering every word for a very long time. Then the footage is not edited at all so when she stops and starts over you want to scream, &#34; just say something... anything ... stop licking your lips and rolling your eyes!!! I would tell you more but I decided to eat my TV at that point rather than watch another second of this really bad crap. Other than that I have no opinion."
"It's totally my fault for not watching the trailer for THE BAY before renting this film, but I had no idea the entire thing would be a collection of poorly filmed video clips, interviews, and shaky-cam shots of people running about and screaming.  That's about it.  There is no plot and there are no characters.OK, there are a few characters.  Kristen Connolly (""Cabin in the Woods"") plays a reporter who is making a documentary about a disastrous plague that infected a small coastal town in Maryland.  It's her voice you hear doing voiceovers, and she's the one pulling all the different film clips together from material confiscated by the government.  Frank Deal plays Mayor John Stockman, who was told about the toxicity in the bay but refused to do anything (he's pretty much a retread of the mayor in JAWS who wouldn't close the beaches because he was worried about the tourist trade).  Then there are a bunch of characters called ""Victim #1,"" ""Fair Man,"" ""Activist,"" ""Middle Aged Supporter,"" and ""Bob.""  I don't remember any of them individually.  But who cares?The plot can be summed up as follows:  The water in the bay is toxic because the mayor allowed chicken processing companies to dump their waste into it, which created mutant parasites, which infected the fish, which infected the people, who are now all developing grotesque blisters and lesions and generally going berserk.  We see a couple of so-called ""research scientists"" doing ridiculous experiments like looking inside a fish's mouth with a flashlight (aha! Parasites in there!).  Doctors speak like high school students.  People run around bleeding and screaming and throwing up.  And Kristen Connolly tries to be all serious as she comments on all this like it's really, really happening.THE BAY is a low budget parody of CONTAGION (which also suffered from too little characterization).  I have no clue why critics gave this film positive reviews - I guess they enjoyed the ""found footage"" technique far more than I did (if I never see a ""found footage"" film again, it will be too soon!).  Just know what you're getting before you put down your money."
I understand the concept but this film was horrible. Don't waste your few dollars....go to Star----- and get a coffee instead !
"I seriously do not understand why people can give this piece of $@%& a positive review, the only reason I can think of is that these people either worked on this film or are sadistic and want you to suffer. This was bad.. terribly bad. It is the kind of movie where people literally walked away from in the theater.>>> SPOILERS &lt;&lt;&lt;This film does not deserve a well thought out review but I will try and give a few examples of why I think of this movie so awful.Like the other reviewers already mentioned, this is a found footage film. However, the manner in which the footage is tied together is so random that you could die from a seizure in the theater.The problem of this film is the collection of situations and actions in those situations that make up this movie as a whole. Literally every scene is worth a serious face palm. The film starts with a random (and way to long) low quality introduction of the setting, followed by a first victim of the parasite, and it goes down from there. There are scientists that find weird unexplainable parasites and jump into the water to take a look. There are two befriended police officers that come across a house with screaming people, one goes into the house with his gun drawn, the other stays in the car with his seat belt on. There is an agency that specializes in outbreaks (viral, bacterial.. whatever) and does not seem to give a damn when they hear about the mysterious issue's in the town. There is a supposedly intelligent couple (dentist & lawyer) that walk into a ghost town filled with dead bodies near the end of the film.. with their few months old baby.. and the guy actually thinks what he sees is funny!? The list goes on and on.. 2 hours of this crapThen there is the science.. like the only other review I could relate with pointed out. The science is made up by a 5 year old. All conclusions that are drawn, numbers that are given, idea's that are thought of.. it is terribly. Just when you hear something that might be vaguely plausible or logical. i.e. the explanation that anomalies could come from pesticides.. nuclear leaks are drawn into the equation to make it sound better or whatever.. Everything about it is pretty pathetic.The overall story is also weak. I mean, maybe there could be made a half-decent film out of the idea behind the movie.. mutated flesh eating parasites, it sounds pretty cool right?.. but in the context of the rest of the film this story only adds to the train-wreck that is called ""The Bay""A part of me died while watching this film, I will never get it back, I'm scarred and I seriously want to kick the creator of this movie in the nuts.. or even better.. I want to go back in time and get raped in stead of watching this film.. I mean it.. getting raped is better!"
"this is one of those movies where you just want to grab the director and ask him if he has any common sense at all...no logic- way over the top- the actions & reactions of the ""infected"" people were totally unrealistic- there are so many holes in the movie that you start getting annoyed half way through. Mixed (very little) fact with fiction- and the fiction part just destroys any fact credibility.how does the reporter manage to survive despite getting the infected blood all over her, drinking from the fair grounds water bubbler and splashing water from the piers fountain all over her face? total BS- she doesn't get the parasite but the doctor treating people does? that's just one of a dozen silly illogical holes in this movie.coulld've been a great horror flick if the director spent a bit more time on the details and story line."
"Turned it off after 20 minutes. I couldn't get past the reporter's incredibly annoying narration. Her voice was just awful. Like? everything? was? a? question? you? guys?  And most irritating of all, she couldn't keep her tongue in her mouth. That's right. It was just hanging out of her mouth ALL THE TIME. Like a big, gross pink slug. Whoever was responsible for casting this crap should seriously consider a career change."
"For this film to be directed by such a good director in the past. This film misses the mark. Another fictional POV film about an infection in the water off of Maine, that infects the town off shore. In my opinion skip this film, because theres nothing there that we havent already seen countless other times."
hate this show... so boring... same thing over and over and over... so scripted... so predictable...no issues with playno issues with purchaseno issues at all!
I've watched all seasons but couldn't finish this one. Brandi's racial remarks and then Lisa's husband's remarks to maid when she asked for just one dress of the many  that Lisa was giving away. All the maid said is she wished she could have one. And he jumped all over her ugh! That did it for me. This show has gone down hill. Nobody gets along anymore. Atleast before there were some fun times. Like I said after the maid thing I was done. Too bad I spent my money on this. That just gives all of them them more money . Like they need anymore than they have already.
"Save the Date really *really* stinks.  It goes nowhere.  It basically sums up the romance genre in one predictably written cliched 80-minute film.  A young woman with low self-esteem moves in with her boyfriend.  She never really does anything that makes us believe she's a perfect match for the man in her life.  Maybe she's depressed or maybe she just has a negative outlook on life.  Who really knows.  It never says which one.  She cares WAY too much about herself as well, like the world should revolve around her ""problems"".She just... does nothing really.  Okay, she hangs out with friends and appears in all the places where guys can hit on her despite how embarrassing the men look when things suddenly go wrong (such as the one musician who jumps off stage and proposes marriage to her resulting in her running out of the concert as quickly as possible due to overwhelming shock and embarrassment).  Somehow even *this* scene blows due to lacking excitement.The tone is way too serious to be a comedy- that's a MAJOR misleading part of the movie description.  Nothing's even remotely funny ever.  The movie never even makes an effort to be hilarious.  All the characters are lifeless and dull with no personality whatsoever and the writing wouldn't make the grade in any other context, let alone a film.  Save the Date reminds me of a time when a film as poorly written as this wouldn't have stood a chance of seeing the light of day in theaters or DVD.  It's amazing amazon doesn't create a 0-star rating feature because Save the Date would easily be placed in the dark hole of 0-star ratings.  I highly recommend avoiding this."
"I just can't, I can't-----I can't stand the bad acting and that Jenny Whatever actress---just horrible, horrible...what is up with her mouth, it was soooo distracting, then it hit me, the actress is slurring her lines! Sooo unrealistic----sorry, but Lifetime was always known for being corny, but some of the old Lifetime Movies were pretty interesting....NOW, they just suck.....don't bother, move on and don't waste 15mins on this drivel....I was actually rooting for the crazy psycho to get this horrible actress with the annoying mouth, the bleached hair and the dead eyes----just can't get pass the 15mins....just can't!"
"Wish I had read reviews before I even tried to watch this.  Gave up after about 15 minutes.  Absolutely nothing to make me want to waste any more of my time.  Seems this &#34;work&#34; is another bit of self promotion by Nancy Grace.  Think she best stick to whatever her fan base is willing to put up with!  She isn't a serious threat to Lee Childs or Michael Connelly, nor even Clint Eastwood and his last few screen bombs!"
I was disappointed in the casting / especially the walk on by Nancy Grace- you got to know whento step aside.  Some one professional should have taken over.  A terrible waste of energy.
"I thought that I would give it a chance, but nope. The whole thing was about covering up the PD bad actions and the strike team is just as bad as the criminals on the street."
"What a waste of time! All these characters are dirty, unethical, and they get away with it.  Don't like the series, actors, or premise of the show."
"In the trailer we see rave reviews from obscure fan sites comparing this film to Toby Hoppers's ground breaking ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" The eternal classic that provided pure terror at a completely subliminal level.There is no real bloodshed or gore in TCM and it remains one of the few horror films on permanent collection within the Museum of Modern Art.Then we see an equally false claim comparing this film to the original cult classic ""Evil Dead"". Sheer brilliance on behalf of Sam Raimi, outrageous production value for it's time and budget - and forever casting Bruce Campbell as one of Horror Fans most beloved actors. Both films scoring a well deserved 99% -98% on rottentomates.Enter ""I didn't come here to die"" this film is more than unworthy in every respect to even stand in the shadows of these motion pictures, let alone be compared to them.Never theatrically released. First time director and writer of the film Bradley Scott Sullivan does a miserable job trying to weave a plot and a compelling story line by stealing specific shots of other, much better and well concieved horror movies - one example being the long shot of the van driving towards the woods - is right out of Chainsaw.Hollow performances by unknowns abound and dreary, sullen predictable dialogue - these are characters we could care less about and perhaps this is the movies most fatal flaw. Because not only is it important that we care about the characters we have to want to root for them - this clunker establishes neither.What those looking to cash in on the genre tend to do over and over is dismiss the intelligence of the audience they're playing to. We're far more both knowledgeable about what makes for good horror and what is more have a keen eye for cliche'. The film might as well have been titled ""Accident Prone In Woods"" I think even gore and splatter fans will find this movie disappointing and anyone with a decent eye, certainly any Dick Smith or Tom Savini fan will find the effects laughable at best.This is the kind of film you can walk into at any point and know immediately what you're seeing and where it's headed. I adore indy films and really do try to take into consideration they are more often than not an effort of love and homage. That said, it's important to overlook flaws you might be tempted to focus on regarding big Hollywoodmachine Horror franchises.But they're exceptions, there are films built on greed that are sub par on virtually every level a movie can be. Films that have made the mistake of dumbing down  for their their audience. ""I didn't come here to die"" is a shinning example of just that."
I quit after 15 minutes. The main reason was the lighting. The night scenes you could hardly see the characters. I also didn't get how they were framing the shots.
I guess it could of been ok... I really don't know because the beginning did not interest me and therefore...I feel asleep on it.
"The acting in this was poor and the quality of the film was poor. It would stop and start several times. This is a movie back from the early 70,S Lots of T&A but you can go to american Pie for that!"
Lasted about 30 min.  Not my type of naked women. I didn't feel it was worth the $3 I spent.
This tv show is very boring and poorly animated. And for a show that is supposed to be an action comedy show there is practically no action. The how to train your dragon series is just very overrated. I cant believe they are making a sequel to the horrible first movie.
"Everyone knew ""Liz and Dick"" was going to be a disaster as soon as it was announced. Two reasons why:1. It was being made by the Lifetime Network, with a TV-movie budget.2. It starred Lindsay Lohan.The pessimism was not unwarranted -- this movie is so bad that I'm surprised Richard Burton hasn't risen from the dead just to throw liquor bottles at the people responsible. I actually hoped that it would be bad in a hilarious, campy way, but instead it's just hideously awkward, cheesy and cheap. As Lohan croaks at one point, ""I'M SO BORED!""The story is narrated by Elizabeth Taylor (Lohan) and Richard Burton (Grant Bowler) from the afterlife. Apparently the heavenly host really want to hear the inside scoop on their relationship. It started during the shooting of ""Cleopatra,"" when Shakespearean actor Burton was unexpectedly cast opposite the scandal-generating superstar Elizabeth Taylor.Well, despite a rocky start, they began a torrid affair. Their romance destroyed both their marriages (her fourth, his first) and caused an even bigger scandal than her previous homewrecking affair. Over the next twelve years, they lived in a whirl of fights, lovemaking, tragedy, alcoholism and gems -- only to divorce, marry and divorce all over again.The story of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton really needs a HBO miniseries, because it's impossible to cram twenty-plus years of high drama into a 90-minute Lifetime movie. And the rushed pace is only one of the movie's problems -- cheap-looking costumes, awful greenscreen, and a choppy disjointed narrative.And yes, the writing is eye-rollingly bad (""You do know I'm shagging him senseless, don't you?""), but not in a funny way. I hoped this would be an over-the-top, campy funny mess, but it was simply dull and fragmented.But the death knell for this movie is Lohan. I have literally seen cats who give better performances than her. Her performance in this movie is more Tommy Wiseau than Elizabeth Taylor -- a doughy, puffy-faced, larygngitic mess that croaks her way through unconvincing fights and crying jags, unable to even convey BOREDOM.And yes, she is even WORSE when she tries to convey some emotional depth (""I am your ocean, but he was your anchor""). For example, Taylor's ""suicide"" -- complete with prancing, posing and Bella-Swan-style ""despairisms"" -- is one of the worst scenes I have seen on television. EVER.It makes me feel sorry for Grant Bowler, who actually seems to be trying REALLY REALLY HARD despite Lohan and a dreadful script dragging him down. Despite the movie's awfulness, he does convey some of the tormented, hard-drinking poet, when he isn't being saddled with dreadful dialogue. And David Hunt gives one of the few good performances as Burton's tragic brother Ifor.I hoped that ""Liz and Dick"" would be a movie that was hilariously, mockably bad... but no, it's just tedious and horribly written, with the worst-cast Elizabeth Taylor EVER."
"Well, the cover of the DVD with such words as Scandal, Child Star, Love Affair, Paparazzi etc, etc.. You'd think the movie would be entertaining, interesting, with a sense of taboo that just makes you want to watch it en grossly just much like the real love Story between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton was. But No, as a viewer I don't get that. I don't get the sense of passionate, scandalous and bizarre love affair. The Only thing I got from watching this Movie is a boring, bland and amateur re-telling of a supposedly legendary love story of two film stars.What else can I say? Lifeless acting from most of the cast. Especially, Lindsay Lohan. Who ever thought she would do a good job at playing Elizabeth Taylor must've had a whimsical sense of humor indeed. Not denying that she's a bad actress watch her act in Mean Girls, The Parent Trap I've gotta give her some credit for acting in these two movies but in this one. Uh-Uh she just did it all wrong! I didn't buy her as Elizabeth Taylor, I didn't buy the fact that she was madly in love to the point of damaging her career. She Just seemed off on screen. Not to mention the slim to none resemblance between her and the real Elizabeth, you'd think she'll put more effort into acting her role to compensate for that fact but no. I was pretty disappointed, the only thing she seemed to do was memorize lines and repeat them on screen with just a tad bit of emotions coming across. Even in her purposed outbursts she just seemed like a walking corpse that the writers weren't even interested in to begin with so they gave her horrendous lines and a very one dimensional character to portray.The Other actors aren't that great either but since they're not the main once they can get away with their zombie walks and poor acting skills. The One Playing Burton was acceptable but that's only because he was surrounded with such lame actors so he stood out as you can say. He tried his best for his defense too bad there was little he could do since the writing itself wasn't that helpful.The Movie itself was tasteless. Most of the time the viewers are told that this and that is happening. For Example, that Richard is cheating on his wife with another married woman which is Elizabeth and are deemed sinful in the eyes of the public but it just seems to come so easy for them afterwards. It's like no one really cares whether they were having an affair or not in such times when things like these were rare. The whole sense of impending danger, the whole sense of scandal is lost in this film.Watching it is like reading an article on the internet about Elizabeth and Richards relationship. That's all I can say. You might as well just read a 5 minute article instead of wasting your time watching this movie cause that's all you're gonna get in the end. The audience don't get to connect with the characters, we don't even get to meet them. We just see Lindsay Lohan presumably yelling, screaming, throwing fits of anger, crying, laughing, smoking, complaining, talking, swimming, kissing and whatever else she's doing on the film. And then the actors are just there. I could care less whatever happens to the characters at the end I don't even want to know. Even if the director decided to twist the story a little bit and have Elizabeth and Richard Commit suicide like Romeo and Juliet instead of divorcing I still wouldn't care.I Guess, I should give credit for the writers and producers for taking such a passionate love affair and making it such a boring, tedious and whiny one.And Lindsay Lohan please next time don't accept a role if you're not gonna act it properly. I'm sure the director didn't intend for you to be a wallflower with nice clothes and make up. You Actually have to act out your role you know.I don't know, if you wanna waste your time then watch this movie other than that skip it completely. I Know I'm sounding a tad too harsh but it's my honest opinion."
"I am truly amazed that I sat through this entire movie. However, you need to realize that I went into it knowing that it would be a train wreck, but it was far worse than I expected. ""Liz and Dick"" is a bloody massacre. For the record, I am actually a member of Team LiLo. As a child star, she showed great potential as a solid B-actress (remember ""The Parent Trap,"" Freaky Friday,"" and of course the iconic ""Mean Girls?""). Then Lindsay Lohan grew up, went to rehab 50 times, got arrested 105 times, and unfortunately she hasn't shown a whole lot of promise since then. I actually feel bad for her because she was so horribly miscast in this role. Lifetime obviously was desperate for viewers, and they cast LiLo as Elizabeth Taylor because they knew people like me would watch. And I did. And LiLo totally bombed.In fairness, the entire movie is an epic disaster (the only saving graces are the costumes, so props to the wardrobe mistress). First, let's talk about Lindsay. Ignore the fact that my cat looks more like Liz Taylor than LiLo does (as I recall, Liz's entire body wasn't covered in freckles). Unfortunately, LiLo put absolutely zero effort into preparing for this role. What you see for two hours is LiLo wearing a bunch of dark wigs, speaking in her regular LiLo voice. There was no attempt to master Liz's signature dialect, or the way she carried herself, or absolutely anything at all. Heck, she didn't even try to ACT most of the time. Everything was completely half-assed. Even when she was playing Angry Drunk Elizabeth and smashing bottles against the wall, her throws were just PITIFUL. It was insulting. The dude playing Richard Burton is only slightly better because he actually tries to act, but just happens to be a really bad actor (decked out in an even worse hairpiece). The sets are awful. The script is languid. And parts of the movie make no sense whatsoever. (Like, they constantly poke fun at Liz for being chubby, but I read that LiLo is so vain that she refused to wear any kind of fat suit for the film, so Richard is poking fun at fat Liz who is wearing skintight leather pants and can't weigh more than 105 pounds. Rewrite, anyone?)Everything. Is. SO. AWFUL. If you go into the film expecting to be entertained by watching really bad Lifetime television, like I was, you may end up pleasantly surprised in that ""Liz and Dick"" is ten times worse than anything you could have possible imagined it to be. My husband likened it to watching a high school theatre production, but I think that analogy is insulting to high school actors everywhere. Bottom line: Dame Elizabeth is rolling in her grave right now. I am glad she didn't live to witness this monstrosity."
This is a cheap bad film with bad acting about a Hollywood icon.  Save your 99 cents. You'd be better off watching an episode of the-its so bad its hard to watch- 'Honey Boo-boo'
"Well, let's give it points for trying, but A Dark Truth, a new Canadian produced echo-thriller unfortunately can't get it's act together. It's self important and semi-pretenses, but it can't be said that it doesn't means well. Few movies address the issue of water rights in South America, and dare I say, even fewer action movies do. So, trying must account for something, but the sad truth is that A Dark Truth is a bust that never manages to succeed in it`s intent, but it's intentions are noble enoughThe nearly always reliable Andy Garcia, recently and bewildering returning to leading man status, stars as Jack Begoison, a former CIA operative turned talk radio host. He lives in Canada, which might explain why his radio show isn't a bunch of crazy rants about the supervise political message of Dr. Seus' the Lorax or that the Dark Knight Rises is an attack on a prominent Republican candidate. Although, one caller does ask about aliens in the white house. All of this has next to nothing to do with the movie, so let's get back to that.From writer/director Damien Lee, who has more than twenty films to his directing  credit, movies such as Abraxas, Guardian of the Universe (starring Jesse Ventura) and Terminal Rush (with ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper), among other movies you haven't seen and other titles you`ll scoff at,. Lee seems to be prolific in the video/DVD world, I hesitate to say efficient, but I don't think I have ever seen a movie he has made before. However, I feel safe in assuming this movie inadequacies are due to his rather dubious skills.A Dark Truth comes across looking very bad. It's not well made, rather dull in it's cinematography and editing. It's writing is more an assembling of clich&eacute;s than an actually story, and some of the performances are rather lifeless. It's the kind of theatrical film that only the first week of January can deliver.It can only be surmised that actors, a talented lot like Garcia, Eva Longoria, Forest Whitaker, Deborah Kara Unger, Kim Coates and Steven Bauer came on board this film because they believed in it's message. Which is more understandable than wanting to say I just made a movie for the director ofAbraxas. Unfortunately, the message is lost in this muddled mess and all that's left is a sad looking and less than entertaining jungle adventure. Whitaker seems asleep most of the time and Coates for the first time makes for a dull villain, it's a shame when Bauer gives the best performance.About the half way point, A Dark Truth, abandons it's original serious minded intent and becomes a rather indolent and generic action flick. The action scenes are badly filmed, too boat. Then it precedes to go on for too long fast tracking itself into a preachy On Deadly Ground style bummer. A Dark Truth may long to be a message film, but it ends up being the kind of movie that Tom Berenger used to make. I think few will see it, and even fewer will take anything useful from it.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com"
Why are things like this on tv?We don't have enough senseless violence in this country? Enough people who get off on others' misery?
"We go to London for this latest creature feature based flick, where the contents of a secret military plane are scattered about the city. Despite the city being locked down some people totally oblivious to this fact enter a storage facility and become trapped (come on you were expecting a movie called ""Storage 24"" to NOT take place in a storage building?). At first things don't seem all bad but soon it becomes clear that there is something inside with them and it's on the prowl, that's really about it folks.The early part with the plane crashing and the aftermath that occured was actually pretty well done. Sadly after the decent opening portions it boils down to a run and hide flick, the people inside try to avoid this creature, which for the budget doesn't look horrible in short shots but the longer ones of it do show how goofy it looks. There's a lot and I mean a lot of ""Don't go in there"" or ""Don't separate"" moments with all involved, but of course for the sake of the movie they all do stupid things that lead to their demise.There's not a lot of scary parts, even the ones that involve the monster, in fact creepiest part was when one of the actors stumbles into a storage unit holding a bunch of creepy looking mannequins . I suppose the dark storage building was supposed to lend some good atmosphere to this typical plot, but there's a lot of uneeded drama and bickering between some of the key characters that bogs portions of the film down.Others have compared how bad ""Storage 24"" is with ""Skyline"", which I can understand but to me ""Skyline"" was much more irritating. ""Storage 24"" is a pretty basic and badly acted monster movie but nothing more, ""Skyline"" seemed like it was aiming for something more and even a possible sequel from how it ended. * out of 4 stars."
I felt like the producers were attempting to remake ALIENS without the big budget or a scary enough creature.  My dogs fell asleep on this one.  They'll usually watch just about anything.  Not tonight! BOOORRRIIIINNNNGGGGG!
"The only thing I can say positive about Storage 24 is that the alien monster is great. It's an old fashion rubber monster man-in-a-suit kind of thing. But in this modern age, such a cheesy effect is bound to turn more people off than to win them over. And this is without a single doubt the best part of this agonizingly bad, cheaply made grade B with a minus British made mix of sci-fi and horror. A barrage of misogyny and stupidity that follows is bound to please only least demanding of paying customers, which I hope there are few.It all starts off with the slight twinkle of promise as an unexplained alien monster is on the loose inside of a storage unit. Also on the loose is a hand full of employees and patrons who are inexplicably trapped inside the storage facility with our guest from another world.So far, so good, but that's all about to change. because in no time at all, Storage 24 becomes a terrible prime time soap with a slimy monster who seems to change size given the requirements of any given scene. Sometimes he's human size, others he seems to tower above them. And this is only the beginning of this movies faults.Storage 24 was written by actors Noel Clarke and Marc Small, along with Davie Fairbanks, it is surprising in it's lack of good roles for just about anybody. The characters are simple one dimensional, obnoxious and unlikable. All the female roles are self-center, treacheras bitches. The men, self-loathing cowards.The acting is just shy of dismal. Not one of the cast members manage to give any substance to their roles, a few of them look like they would rather be home watching telly, which you can`t blame them. Leading lady Antonio Campbell-Hughes is a new kind of low for any actor who is not a professional athlete or musician making there way intro film.Given this material, one could imagine a very funny movie from Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright, but alas, it is not meant  to be. Storage 24 is ungodly stupid, uninspired and worst painfully dull. Little more than a sub par retread of many other similar movies, some better, few not. The one that Storage 24 most resembles is that great summer turkey the Watch, perhaps my least favorite movie of last year. Yes, the kind of movie we all want to see more of. Showing that it isn't just us yanks who are creatively bankrupt.There is an appalling lack of interest here and zero energy to sustain the long 87 minute running time. Director Johannes Roberts, behind the gladly unseen DTD flicks like Hellbender and Forest of the Damned, clearly has no eye for the camera. Shot in a single location, not only does that let you know it's cheap, it just looks it and feels it even more. Roberts has given us an amateur hour and a half here. You wont be able to believe such a movie is still released into American cinemas. Even going in with low expectations,  you will be astonished at how low they would have had to have been.In my original review for Movie Zone, I gave this stinker a half of a star, but amazon wont let me do that. They should allow me an exception, they don't understand the pain I went through sitting through this.read my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com"
"Do not waste your money or time watching this fake ""mystery-documentary"". This show is another in the recent trend of tricking people into buying a program with the enticement that they are going to see a documentary about a subject that is new or at least out of the mainstream but are instead shown 44 minutes of an unqualified host getting on planes, driving in cars, hiking and camping out, sometimes talking to supposed indigenous people and lots of talking to other unqualified ""experts"" about how mainstream (translation: real experts) don't agree with what they say in the script. It's obvious that the host and his gaggle of fake experts don't believe a word of the gibberish they spout. This program's host is one of the poorest actors. None of the hosts of these fraudulent ""mystery-documentaries"" do a very good job of convincing you that they actually believe the nonsense they recite from the script. This program's host is utterly unconvincing, obviously unqualified and unacceptably foul-mouthed. He obviously thinks he's being edgy when he cusses which kills any likability. This series was conceived by a gang of unscrupulous people who wanted to get in on the 'Ancient Aliens' misrepresentation bonanza. And no, it's not ""good fun"". It is not funny that people are making and selling these fabricated ""mystery-documentaries""."
"Not sure what other topic could possibly be turned into a reality show.....This ones pretty ridiculous. I have to admit it becomes entertaining, even with the ridiculously OVER dramatization by the narrator/VoiceOver dude...What annoys me is the fact that the well being of the Amazon is completely disregarded by the greed of gold by way of a lazy, fat Alabama man.100+ year old Trees are bulldozed by the dozen, the ground is excavated and left in shambles and the incredibly eroding, polluting envirmentally polluting cost of mining is never addressed.  I hope the producers of this ridiculous show had to pay millions to the locals who will be left with the clean up of the un repairable mess this fools leave behind in the name of entertainment"
"The bottom subtitles blend in so much with the image on the screen, they are impossible to read. Disappointing. I couldn't watch it. But the art looked great for the five minutes I watched. The subtitles need a solid background to you can read them (and quickly)."
"Talentless and bland, just like Portland itself. Constantly trying to hook onto some form of kitsch or pop-culture to make itself relevant and consistently failing to do so. If you watch this program while actually thinking, you begin to come to the conclusion that the earth is very much overpopulated and the cultivation of the excess should immediately start with C and D list celebs so they do not further detract from humanity as a whole with pablum such as this."
This was not funny at all. It is just an excuse for people to cus for no reason and pretend there is a legitimate reason for it.
"I have in the past really liked Timothy Olyphant (like in Deadwood), and I found earlier seasons of Justified kinda entertaining. Olyphant has the ability to play a straight-arrow hero in a unique and wonderful way. The trouble with Justified is that he has become less and less heroic. He doesn't stand for anything, anymore. He seems just like the low-lifes he pursues, except he's got a badge. Nothing important is at stake - just whether the addicts of Harlan County get their fix. I say leave them alone with their devices, Raylan. Oh, and do we have to put up with a whole new helping of overdone evangelical crap? We've already seen all this in the first season. False preaching can only divert us for so long. I wish they would transplant Raylan Givens to some city where some dastardly plot is afoot that actually matters to somebody. Get him out of the backwoods, please! And make him a bit serious, not just a facetious lout who can't stay out of trouble."
"After watching the first episode I said this. Kinda wish I hadn't paid for the whole season first, but I've always liked Megan Goode as an actress and assumed this would be GREAT. Anyways.....It's not a completely terrible series but it wasn't ""spectacular"" like everyone else is raving, and the writers/producers definitely could have summed it up within 90 mins. This should've been a 90min B-Movie straight to DVD and aired on Cinemax or BET-Starz.Also I was really annoyed how they had her jumping on her cellphone every other minute to report her findings ALL LOUD & IN THE OPEN to her FBI contact. Spying on peoples computers 2 secs after they'd leave the room while AGAIN talking loud telling everything to her FBI contact via cellphone. No one would be dumb enough to do that, ESPECIALLY an undercover cop. They could have tried a little bit better with writing that in.Seriously, I'm 1.7 episodes in and I'm already bored & feeling like this is redundant & going no where. They've already revealed ""Who Dunnit"" & ALL the dirty secrets in episode 1. Like, why should I watch any further? *lol* This is another reason why this series could have ended after the first episode. The audience has been made aware of everything, the rest is just filler & boring content. I see WHY this series wan't renewed, strange that people keep posting ""Why did they cancel this show!?"" Cuz it SUCKED thats why. As a series it's a 1-Star as a B-Movie it's a 3-Star."
I liked the story but actors are at least supposed to be educated and all the cussing was completely unnecessary.
I use the series to help me sleep. The plot and characters are pretty much the same...and on and on....
"It's too bad that the obnoxious personality of Abby and some of the Dance Moms (Kelly and Christy especially) are making this show so difficult to watch.  I love to see the kids dance but the behavior of these Moms are making it difficult for me to continue watching.  I would get rid of Christy and Kelly and leave Nia's Mom and Asia's with a new group of Moms.  What happened in New Orleans was unbelievable, especially because these women are supposedly wealthy enough to have had some education.  Although their grammar is horrendous.  Do they not teach grammar in Pennsylvania.  These mothers, in my opinion, do for Pennsylvania what Jersey Shore and Jerseylicious did for New Jersey."
"Much of this show is out right child abuse as these blood sucking, low life adults ""use"" their children to get fame or money, even if in the process they must be the worst examples of parenthood to those beautiful wonderful kids the have.Years from now you'll see these sweet children with a myriad of issues, trying to figure out what happened to themselves on a show where ""NO"" love or forgiveness or any positive support is given at all.Just taking a child in your arms, even if they foul something up badly, and praising their effort never happens here, and NEVER, EVER happens from that lazy tub of lard Abby, unless it somehow makes ""HER"" look good. The child is all but forgotten amidst all the desperate problems of the parents. I can't come close to watching this horrid psycho drama of tearing down our best gifts in the world until their just like the selfish parents that gave them birth....a total mess.Yeah, that's what kids need at that age is more pressure and more competition to see who's ""worthwhile"" in life. Who's top dog or top top of my ""whittle pyramid."" Makes me sick to my stomach to see how they treat these fantastically talented young girls.NOT ONE parent would put up with a boss like Abby, for two minutes in real life, until charges would be filed, but these moms are ADDICTED to abuse, and all hang on to each other for the ride.Disgusting and un-watachable."
"I loved this show but Abbey is going over the top.  Her behavior is bordering on emotional abuse and bullying of children.  People were outraged over last Tammi on last year's season of Basketball Wives.  Abbey is getting pretty close and she's pulling her antics on CHILDREN.  What kind of example is being set for them??? Is this like Lance Armstrong syndrome, that you do whatever to win???? That they have to be in abusive situations to be on a winning team?  I'll have to pass on this show from now on.  I can't condone children being in this environment."
"If you want to pissed off and more irritated with your day, then by all means watch this show...if you value your sanity, logic and reason...then DO NOT.  I now feel more stupid having watched part of a couple episodes.  I now grieve at the loss of the hour or 2 of my life that I will never get back."
"I watched the first episode and kept waiting for the good guys, i.e. ordinary citizens fighting a world taken over by corporations, to win. It quickly became clear that ordinary people were the BAD GUYS in a world run for and by corporations. I guess if they produce enough of these, impressionable children will think that is a good thing. Adults not so much. They own the media I won't add my hard earned entertainment dollar to support this propaganda."
"So I was really looking forward to this show. I looks like hard sci-fi. Which I love. It's got two actresses whom I like. Lexa Doig (Andromeda) and Jennifer Spence (SGU). X-file's ""smoking man"" is in it. And it is Canadian SYFY (I love Sanctuary & Lost Girl). So this seemed like a shoe in. Ugh! 1)65 years is not enough time for corporations to take over the world and impose a police state. I mean, that's just lame. 2) 65 years is not enough time for us to have all that great tech. Biometrically calibrated suits? Transformer guns? Come'on! 165 years...maybe. But barely 6 centuries?. No, I don't think so.3) How is the Kiera's husband not a terrorist when he totally over react to her being stationed in the execution room. )Even though I know it was old Alex's doing. 4) All the ethnic people are bad. 5) One more, all the ethnic people are bad. 7) Let me say that again. There are only 2 black dudes and 2 asians... all bad. 8) The ""bad guys"" are the anti corporation Liber8 (lame name!) and the ""good guys"" are corporations?! Really? Is this show funded by BP? 9) Alex, the wunderkin, runs a sky net style lab in his shady (Those folks look all kinds of suspect!) parents barn?! I could go on. This show just wasn't my cup of tea. The science is lack luster and while the tech seems cool it is is just not believable. I will give this one more chance only because I love SYFY but it better get good real quick because I simply don't have the emotional stamina to watch a whole show that promises to be awesome science fiction and delivers nothing but badly thought out she-ite. I'm looking at you Lost."
"What must TV execs think of the American populace that this kind of thing keeps getting on the air? What must we think of ourselves to allow it? You could not put together a more forgettable cast if you assembled all the recurring background characters from the entire series run of Law & Order. It is painful to watch this and anyone, writer, actor, set designer, or gaffer involved in it that thinks it or themselves are anything close to humorous needs to rethink their entire life. At the end of the day, though, they should all be grateful that in spite of how spectacularly empty and tasteless this show is, it is still not as bad as ""Whitney""."
NO rating. Never got to see the preview. Tried to watch it but the Amazon system wouldn't make it happen. After a few tries I just gave up and got it elsewhere.
"I mean, seriously.  Pretty sure the even used the exact same lines. G. R. O. S. S. How lazy and terrible."
Just watching ticket writers got boring. My favorite part was the impound lot and when that was gone it lost its humor.
"Why anyone with half a brain find this interesting is beyond me.Is this society so stupid that this is acceptable to take time to watch?Yeah, I guess so ...3rd season..honestly I can't even stand to look at them.I thought I would just ck it out and it's just horrid..I think it's sad that thisis being produced..of course it's tons of money for the producers and that's why.If I could have put a zero rating I would have."
I'm suprised they would make a series like this.  A person would need to be very bored to make it through even one of these.
"why would anyone be interested in these women? Just bad, rude behavior that they seem quite proud of. Just no value at all."
So much to say and I tried to be fair but I turned it off about 1/3 of the way through.
"Okay. This is supposed to be Lovecraftian...right? Well, BARELY. Just because there is an amorphous many eyed monster in it does NOT make it Lovecraftian. I'v been a Lovecraft fan for 40+ years and I'm pretty sure the man from Providence would have declared it ""utter rubbish."" the script is bad, the acting is bad, it isn't funny (although it tries to sell iself as such) and of course it is true that it shouldn't be...but it belaboredly tries to be. This junk bites the big pickle."
"I watched this on one of the many sites on which you can watch movies free. Just google the name of a movie and ""watch online"" and you'll find them. Anyhow we can screw Hollyweird, I'm on board for that, since they screw us every chance they get with their crap movies. Even free, this film wasn't worth watching."
"I never read the book.  I hated this movie. First of all, I could barely understand what the main character was saying most of the time.  Regardless, it wasn't entertaining, just annoying.  I'm guessing that it is ""trying"" to be intellectual, but I just found it to be fragmented, distasteful and uninteresting. This movie jumps around, has a lot of ineffective voice overs and comes across as a poorly made B movie."
"Boring, couldn't get past the first 20 mins, fell asleep and then continued for another 10 mins and quit. It was just a pointless waste of my time"
"We really liked the first two seasons of Dual Survival, watching marathons of it at a time.  The chemistry between Cody and Dave was fun to watch.We couldn't make it through the first episode of Season 3 though because we can't stand Joe's personality.  The scene where he killed the boar is what did him in for us.  He sticks the knife in the boar and does it brutally and then looks around in such a fake way. No respect towards the animal or taking a life, it was all about trying to look like some kind of warrior. He tries way too hard to come off as this macho guy and we couldn't stand him.  I don't know what happened to Dave, but the show isn't the same without him."
I made it though 12 minutes and couldn't take the annoying 'whine' which was supposed to be 'comical' I suppose. Cliche drivel. Nothing clever--a guy in make-up. a man with a bad gay act. commercial spots half-heartedly thrown in randomly. I am not sure who would find this funny--I think middle-school kids have more sense and tact and a more complex sense of humor. The world needs to back off this type of junk and feed off something with intelligence and maturity.
"I tried to get through this multiple times but just can not. As far as I can tell, no plot, just jumps right into tight, dimly light, tunnels, spaces and ""a monster"". Sorry but this is just not enough to keep me interested. Too many other movies that use dark spaces and monster and at least a little plot or characters I can care about.  Perhaps there is a plot that I just have not gotten to yet but how long should one wait until something is explained?? Update 15 Jan 2013: well, watched it all and still not worth a look. ""Plot"" if you call it that came way late and still not worth the time watching. Hope this movie cost like $1000 to make and not more."
"i understand why some would watch, but i just couldn't latch on to any of the people... i just couldn't get &#34;hooked&#34;.."
"What I have seen, it is barely okay. I hope it can only get better. Need to see more. Could be good."
Couldn't even watch the whole episode.  I'd rather see young adults behaving with a higher moral code. Not worth watching.
"Buck wild is (to me) a documentary on what NOT to be....Instead of ""going mudd-n"", and perpetually trying to breed yet one more ""buck wild baby"" these ignorant to the world ""children"" should learn something, and spend their time better...The stereo type that they present to the world about their community, is about the same one that participants on the Jerry Springer show bring to theirs....Obviously I'm missing the point (or simply ""can't stand"" the obvious point) of the whole show, which is nothing less than just the creation of a red-neck-hill billy version of Friends, or another MTV's coming of age slumber party. The first one or two episodes were entertaining, but the repetition on how to start your life off at a dead end is just boring.I'm sure that they (this show) has an audience, but it's not me and I'm suspect that their ""audience"" can't afford cable, Netflix, or amazon prime. They (the intended audience)are to busy out ""canning"" or ""scrapen"" (picking up scrap metal co they can afford more Busch beer) to even watch this show......"
"I watched one episode and that was enough.  I wasn't watching this show to become smarter or to learn anything, just thought I would check it out and maybe be entertained a little.  After watching this show I was saddened that teenagers could be watching this and maybe think that some of this stuff was a good idea.  I know I only saw one episode, but it was the exact opposite of what I would teach any young kid how to live their life.  Once again I know that this show was made for entertainment only, but it lacked in entertainment and wasn't worth watching another episode."
"I watched this documentary ""The Perfect Human Diet"" with great interest.  I feel it did a very credible job of trying to establish what Homo Sapiens have eaten through history.  However, it did not do justice to establish scientifically or answer the question what is ""The Perfect Human Diet""?  It left more questions than answers.  If the goal/intention was to leave that answer up to the audience, then it did a good job.  I would like to ask C.J. Hunt, are you a meat eater? or what are your eating choices?  Unfortunately, I don't think your documentary was very good in promoting an important dialogue as to what is the perfect human diet for homo sapiens to stay healthy."
"This entire documentary felt like an infomercial. Also, imagine a world where a news reporter tells you something other than the news: you lost me at hello.Bottom Line: I'd rather a wet paper bag talk to me. No. Energy. Whatsoever."
"I really hate people who live in pretend time.  Cliff Notes - guy lives not so healthy finally decides to do something about it and somehow got a Greenlight to make this stinker of a finger wagging tome.OK - we're doing things all wrong and he knows how to fix that.  Embarking on a global journey to discover the &#34;perfect&#34; human diet (we all know where that's going) but it's oh so much more than that.  It's designed to fill empty humans with a new lifestyle since all the other lifestyles people like this choose have never worked.OK, so cavemen didn't have Twinkies.The biggest fraud on the planet are folks who claim losing weight is a function of what you eat.But  AND LISTEN CLOSELY FATTIES .....it's not what you eat......it's not even what's eating you........IT'S HOW MUCH YOU MOVE.Diets DO NOT WORK  In fact they make it harder to stay fit.What makes you fit is doing things that make you fit.  Eating Twinkies do not make you fit.  Eating legumes just make you gassy, which is fine if you're 10 or have a 10 year old you want to entertain.  What makes you fit is walking around the block.There, now put the $4.99 you would have paid for this boring waste of me me me me me towards some nice comfy walking shoes and get out and walk.  You don't even have to run.  A mile in the morning and a mile in the evening should keep your waist around 32 if you're a guy.  No need to spend money on the gym unless you enjoy the locker room visuals.  But we have the interwebporn today so no need to waste time in a stinky locker room collecting toe nail fungus."
It was not as good as I hoped.  It really boiled down to ...don't eat processed food.  I fell asleep twice.
"I made it through the first 30 minutes after renting. It was agonizing. So rather then continue to suffer I stopped watching.Usually even a bad movie, if I paid to rent it I finish it. This one I just couldn't, it was like watching a bunch of dumb youtube fails."
"I really can not say how much I couldn't stand this movie. I'm sorry but I have grown weary of writers and directors who think that they can paint themselves as artists by making an incoherent movie with characters no one cares about that flows free form from one scene to the next in an attempt to be different. You're not different you're just bad.The basic premise here is Charles Swan III (portrayed by Charlie Sheen copying his performances from TWO AND A HALF MEN and ANGER MANAGEMENT) stars as a man in love with a woman who leaves him when she discovers he has a drawer filled with Polaroid pictures of past conquests. Why he feels the need to keep these around in such an open area who knows. Distraught at her leaving he attempts to drive after her, wrecks his car and ends up in the hospital.From here the movie goes every which way it can. It moves backward and forward in time, it moves into the surreal world of Charles's mind, it bring in characters just made for cameos and it goes nowhere fast. Some reviews of this film have called it genius and others have called it one of the worst films ever made. I tend to fall in the latter group.I found it difficult just to get through a large portion of this film let alone from beginning to end. I'll be the first to admit I never got there. Something inside of me said that there were better things in this world I could be doing than watching this piece of manure posing as art. Movies like this do little but make me angry when I read about other films that have lingered on shelves for years that sounded good but never got made. Then I realize that someone gave the people behind this movie money to make it and I think why this and not that?The film was written/directed by Roman Coppola who co-wrote THE DARJEELING LIMITED and MOONRISE KINGDOM with director Wes Anderson. I've never been a huge fan of Anderson for many of the reasons this film didn't work, but at least I've been entertained by them in one way or another. This movie feels like it was made by a fanboy of Anderson's who wanted to show he could make just as quirky a film. Instead it falls flat on its face offering a boring film that makes no sense and is difficult to watch let alone enjoy.Don't let the cover fool you. Names like Charlie Sheen, Bill Murray, Patricia Arquette and Jason Schwartzman may be listed in the credits but I could only believe they did this movie as a favor to Coppola. They would have done him a bigger favor by telling him that yes indeed; the king wasn't wearing any clothes."
Last season this show started out phenomenal. This season I'm still trying to figure out what happened. The storyline has gotten so goofy I'm not sure if it's going to survive another season. Bring back the original writers and get the show back on track
"I thought I was ordering something else ,but this is not my thing don't waist your money people. If your into this type of thing so be it. I'm not going to change what I've written on this review, it's going to stay. If you don't like it keep it moving. He or she below tried to check me on what, I should or shouldn't write. You should start trying to check your own essay, before you start insulting someone else's reviews. He or she had plenty mistakes in their essay below in my comment box. I don't plan on hitting the edit button, but maybe you should(THIS IS MY REVIEW). I will write and use whatever text I please. My opinion is my review, and out of 48 people you chose to stop and comment on mines I'm flattered chump. ;)This person goes by the name of Le Strye. He or She is constantly bullying and making harassing comments on this particular post. Anytime you constantly send someone unwanted messages that's considered bullying your way through. This person might even go to the extent of changing their name just to post again and again and again. I have contacted Amazon in regards to this matter. After he or she kept sending insulting messages to this post and another on yesterday. They tried to sending ugly messages to me and go back to edit , but Amazon is investigating and tracking the edited messages that were sent. You can't out smart tech support. I'm assuming this must be the supporter of this film and is trying to bully people into giving this movie 5 stars. Again, it's my review and it want change. I won't entertain foolishness!"
"There are a few brief sequences that work, but mostly this is just very very tired stuff.  No new light is shed on the issue.  The take of ""this is how the issue has affected me personally"" seems contrived.  The issue is better covered elsewhere (not least in realistic fiction like ""The Wire"" and ""The Corner"").  There's no value here."
"I don't usually hate things, but I cannot stand that I spent my candy money on one episode of this show! Lame"
"What a bore.  How many more Blair Witch Project copy-cats are people going to make?  I guess if you like the show where the people &#34;hunt Big Foot&#34;, running around in the woods in the dark with shaky cameras saying &#34;did you hear THAT?&#34; every 2 minutes, you will like this one.  In this one instead of  running around in the dark woods,  they run around in a dark mine with shaky cameras saying &#34;did you hear THAT&#34; every 2 minutes.  Even Art Bell must fall asleep trying to watch this silliness."
"There is so much to say about this television show and I'm not sure I can cover it all, none of which is good. The only good thing about the show is that they managed to cast Kevin Bacon in it and he is usually a guaranteed sign of quality. I take that back, there is something else that is good about the show; the premise of it. The first two episodes of ""The Following"" are promising in the sheer sense that the show COULD have great promise. A serial killer. A back story. A detective with a history and a relationship with the serial killer's wife. A serial killer who can commit crimes from prison due to a cult following of psychos. All of these great ideas are squandered.The reasons why these ideas are squandered is, in my opinion, for one simple reason: ""The Following"" is trying to be ""24"". In an effort to be relentless, non-stop, intense action and thrills, ""The Following"" throws an event at you every five minutes. Therefore, instead of being intelligently fleshed out, it is hastily fleshed out. Every five minutes the show opens itself up for continuous ridicule for stupid teenage criminals, stupid FBI agents who should have known better, criminals who aren't tracked or followed, or just plain illogical assumption story archs. Instead of the creators doing some research and giving us a reason to think that Joe Carroll (the serial killer) is brilliant, we are left to just assume so.Instead of being intelligently thought out, the show relies upon gimmicks; murderers who don't murder but talk, murderers who have no reason to leave someone alive but do because that person isn't supposed to die yet, victims explaining why the murderer didn't kill them, ""He said he didn't kill me because a live hostage would slow you down more than a dead one.""  Oh, he did huh? Well that was nice of him.... thanks for the info. A detective held by three teenage murderers whittling through his ropes with a hidden knife and they don't see it despite all of them standing ten feet away. Then you have a serial killer who just calls the detective pretty much every episode and has a nice chat and tells him how screwed he is.Mainly though, the ""24""ish format to the show asks the creators to explain escapes and FBI blunders every five minutes and after about 10 of those, or two episodes, the gimmick is over. Then when it continues, the show becomes eye-roll boring and has absolutely zero tension. The tension has no intelligence to it. There is zero tact to the show. Where a show like ""CSI"" would take the time to explain some of the reasoning or how things happened or worked, ""The Following"" doesn't have time for that, and when it does, the explanation is ridiculous.Nobody should be giving this show 5-stars in my opinion. NOBODY. This is not a great show. Nowhere close. Is it a terrible show, like my 1-star suggests? I think so. Maybe that is too harsh. Yet when I see a show that has so much promise and lucky people are making MILLIONS OF DOLLARS to entertain us and they give us something that absolutely ANYBODY with basic writing skills could write, you can't be too harsh. When the writers and directors have zero TACT or make no attempt to be intelligent in their tact, but just give you every horror/thriller cliche in the book and expect you to drool and return every week.  No thanks. 1-star baby. That's what you get for your lack of effort."
"LOVE the show, but went elsewhre to watch. even premium  members are charged additional to watch . could watch on another site for FREE and saw no need to stay her and pay to watch.."
The series is beautifully produced and well-acted. But the grisly focus is creepy and offensive. It's just porn in a pretty package.
Lacks character depth and relies too much on shock value. For a series to be successfulit has to have more than this one provides.
"One of the most precious atributes that distinguishes us from any other species is our ability to empathize with our fellow man.I was barely able to get through the first episode of THE FOLLOWING, at which point I decided I would not be able to bear the agony of continuing to watch -- and vicariously experience -- the gut-wrenching terror of one person after another being so realistically tortured, then brutally murdered.Shameless, unpardonable trash, which can only serve as ""creative"" inspiration for the most deviant among us."
"The show managed to be apolitical for the first half dozen installments, but two militia psychos were introduced and the only explanation we get for their murderous and evil vocation is &#34;we are Constitutionalists&#34;. Oh I feel so shunned and associated with psycho-murderers because I know what is in the Constitution and that most of modern government violates it. If you are not going to discuss something seriously then don't bring it up. Just using your show for some not-so-clever name calling is not impressive it is pathetic and indicates an intellectual and honesty deficit."
"YUCK, negative five is more like it. UNBELIEVABLE SERIAL KILLERS WITH PERFECTLY COMBED HAIR... unplausible. BLOOD, BLOOD and more blood for no good reason. Hannibal Lector was a much more classy act."
"The best thing about this new series is the cast. I was drawn to the series by K Bake, J Purfoy and Maggie Grace.  Whoever made this show needs to put them in something good. The concept of the ultra genius serial killer with a following has been done to death.  We have the same nutty professor and flawed but brilliant agent who must catch him.  Buckets of blood but not not fun blood like ""Dexter"".  The end of the first episode is  predictable.  I cannot see spending any time with this show unless I get drunk and pass out.  Plus POE?  Give me a break....if you are a smarty pants professor pick someone less obvious like Proust, or Joyce or Norman Mailer (who would have made a really interesting serial killer).  Please Canadians release the New Primeval!"

The plot is a typical, predictable Archer having to get out of the ""Day After"" consequences of his latest drunken escapades the night(s) before.Plot negatives:-- Ending falls flat. Ron (the old dude Mallory married) is at the opera with Mallory and he's air-conducting to the same song as Archer who is doing his air-conducting in a hot tub while supervising Woodhouse eating a bowl of spider webs. Like much of the episode, it's rehashed material.Best line:-- When Archer says, ""It's not a phaser!"" - Can't have enough Star Trek references.Worst line:-- When Woodhouse says, ""Sometimes I think I should just run away. But who would take me in?"" - Sad. Not amusing at all -- unless you're a sociopath.Ratings scale: 1 to 5Season 1 = 3.9Season 2 = 4.5 (Best Season thus far)Season 3 = 3.5 (Episodes 1-3 = 4.5 Episodes 5, 6, 7 and 9 = 4, The rest = 2.5)Season 4 = 3.0 (Episode 1 = 2.5, Episode 2 = 3.5, Episode 3 = 2.0 [Way too much gore, perversion and absurdity.] Episode 4 = 3.5____________________*Back in the day the pitch by the cable company was ""Look, it's worth paying for because there are NO ads!...well except for the local over-the-air (OTA) stations that we pipe in for free (cable companies paid nothing for OTA at that time). But hey, we can't do anything about that, we're just providing you with the convenience of not having to have an antenna too."" They didn't mention that MOST people were getting cable to fix the problem of having to risk their lives installing antennas only to get notoriously unreliable lousy reception. So, like frogs thrown into a pot of cold water that is slowly heated up will fool them into staying in the pot, people just dealt with the gradually increasing temperature of the water i.e. ads, ads and more ads that were promised not to be there. Then, simulcast sports events came and the cable company said, ""We can't do anything about it, the networks are forcing us to include the ads. Besides, what do you expect us to do when they cut to ads?"" Then they said, ""Inflation! Everyone has to raise prices. You can either pay higher subscription fees or put up with ads on heretofore commercial-free stations."" And the frog stew was ready to be served.So go ahead and submit to be boiled alive. The rest of us are jumping out of the pot. Rivet, rivet."
Please stop the commercials or we will stop buying these. Clearly someone has lost sight of why we buy these videos. If we wanted commercials we would watch regular tv. We pay a premium per episode for a reason. If you take away that reason we stop buying videos. It's not rocket science.
"This cartoon is bad in so many ways.  The dialog is poorly written, the use of that stupid chimp noise drives me crazy, the stories are lazy.  Aunt May's house turns into a death trap.  It's not just insulting to older watchers but to young viewers.  Every week it is pretty much the same.  These guys are powerful and they spend 15 minutes getting beat up and then coming together as a team and winning in the end.  Boring.I need to stop watching this show.  It is a waste of money and time."
This in no way is a horror movie.  I finally got a chance to watch it for free and it stunk worse than a dead road kill on a hot New Mexico day.  Best advice is to stay away from this movie unless you want to watch a man handcuffed for days and when he's released by his best friend he forgives him as if it never took place. I would have been pissed and started kicking some backside. I'm awarding this movie the worst D- rated movie of 2013.
"Don't be fooled by any good reviews....This is definitely the WORST piece of garbage I have ever seen...No explanation, no closure...Just one of those endings that not only gives ZERO explanation of WTF just happened!!!...Not even slight innuendo, I am truly shocked at just how bad this was"
"Oh no, ""Ancient Aliens"" again. The *fifth* season?! How many silly seasons can there possibly be? And all the true believer reviewers again! ""Lots of cool facts"". Geezus. Good people, there are arguably *no* true facts in this series *at all*.True to form, I've only watched one episode, ""The Von Daniken Legacy"". I admit that I hate Erich von D&auml;niken. His ideas or ""question marks"" about aliens visiting Earth in ancient times (in pyramid-like UFOs, to boot) must be *the* worst superstition ever spawned. Homeopathy and reductionist materialism, come back, all is forgiven! D&auml;niken's ""theories"" are so remarkably ridiculous in a kind of inimitable folksy style, with the main protagonist playing the role of fat German bar-owner spewing ""common sense"", that they almost make me weep! The fact that I used to believe in ancient aliens myself only ads insult to the injury. OK, I was only eleven at the time, but hell, I'm a perfectionist.And yes, I need to chill and have a candy bar, I know...OK, I'm back. Has ""Ancient Aliens"" become any better during my coffee break? Well...no. So here goes!I'm not necessarily opposed to rejected knowledge claims (avid readers of my reviews, all two of them, may have noticed a certain soft spot for Bigfoot and...ahem...John Michael Greer), but D&auml;niken's speculations really are annoying and extremely unsophisticated. D&auml;niken, a romantic adventurer of the classical kind, has no formal training in archaeology, anthropology or comparative mythology I'm aware of. Yet, he goes around the world, see mysterious stone structures, declare them ""impossible"" and...voil&aacute;, this proves that aliens built them! The magnificent stone structures at Puma Punku in Bolivia are declared ""impossible"", when a more reasonable hypothesis is that they *aren't* impossible at all - I mean, they are there, aren't they, and they are made out of sandstone, not moon rock. That the local Natives can't build them, and point to the sky as explanation for who did, leads D&auml;niken to conclude that...well, aliens did it. It's all so breathtakingly simple.Another example is Lord Pakal at Palenque in Mexico, debunked at least 10,000+ times, but still going strong. If looked at horizontally and with some creative imagination, the lid of Pakal's tomb looks like a guy manning a space rocket. If looked at vertically, using scholarly knowledge of Mayan mythology and iconography, the magnificent artwork shows Pakal being symbolically sacrificed. But no, D&auml;niken's folksy immediate impression simply must be true, or else no ratings for History Channel...Indeed, it's precisely the populist style, pitting independent researcher against the scientific establishment, which explains part of D&auml;niken's appeal. D&auml;niken is our ""audience substitute"". While everything you read in peer-reviewed journals isn't necessarily true, there *is* a reason why archaeologists need formal training, not just the ability to run around inside megalithic monuments gasping at the sheer ""impossibility"" of it all. There is another salient feature of the ancient astronaut milieu, too, one D&auml;niken is at pains to explicitly deny in this documentary. D&auml;niken says he hasn't formed a new religion. In a purely formal sense, he is right. He is *attacking* religion by a modern form of euhemerism, in which the gods are explained away in ""naturalist"" fashion as space travellers in nuts-and-bolts craft. What D&auml;niken doesn't want to see, but what surely almost everyone else spotted long ago, is that the belief in ancient astronauts is *in effect* a new kind of religion. At the very least, D&auml;niken is offering the masses a potent substitute for religion. The large amount of spiritual types who have climbed onboard the fiery chariot surely shows what we are dealing with. As for D&auml;niken himself, he even claims that the aliens created us and will return one day! Thus, he is specifically tailoring his speculations to an audience used to the *Christian* religion. I don't think Taoists, Shintoists or the Dogon in Mali eagerly awaits ""the return of the gods""...Claude Vorhillon and his Ralians are the most obvious example of how ""ancient aliens"" can be turned into a religion (a religion which claims to be materialist, in fact). In their case, the quasi-Biblical traits are very obvious. Zecheriah Sitchin is another example of a person forming what is really a new religious movement around ideas presumably inspired by D&auml;niken's. And D&auml;niken himself? Isn't he really the exoteric attractor of the new creed, its Aaron so to speak? If you take the bait, I'm sure more ""esoteric"" people are waiting in the wings. I've heard that the Ancient Astronaut Society, which started as a D&auml;nikenite fan club, ended up as a New Age group. Thus, paradoxically the appeal of D&auml;niken's message could be seen as a combination of both populist anti-science and elitist ""hidden knowledge"", both modern irreligion and post-modern religion. An interesting object for a comparative religion study, I'm sure! These people don't understand that *they* are the ones that should be placed under the sociological and psychological microscope...The religious/Meaning aspect is surely the reason why so many people are oblivious to the (easily spotted) contradictions in D&auml;niken's books. How can aliens (that's *aliens*, for heaven's sake!) breed true with humans? If they can, why has no alien DNA been found in our gene pool? (Albert Einstein doesn't count.) Why would aliens need to build stone structures at Puma Punku, if they have super-advanced technology light years ahead of us? Why aren't there any *real* traces of a high technological civilization in India, if the Vedic peoples interacted with aliens? D&auml;niken's supporters point to ""mysteriously"" charred stone walls as evidence for ancient A-bombs, making you wonder why the bombs didn't obliterate the whole town, rather than just charring its walls...Seriously, should I continue?Are there real, unsolved mysteries in the universe? Oh, definitely. You already know which ones: where do we come from, why are we here, where are we going... And why *this* fun house of a planet? I'm willing to contemplate the erroneousness of materialism, the existence of Spirit, even one or two paranormal phenomena (although hopefully not on my favourite Swiss hotel). But literal, flesh-and-blood (or green jelly) aliens scaring the living daylights out of Moses, breeding true with female ape-men, and erecting stone structures of a suspiciously-looking human provenance all around the globe just for their higher amusement (and ours?)...naaaah. It's bad archaeology, bad anthropology, bad comparative religion, and - when push comes to shove - probably even bad spirituality.Erich von D&auml;niken and his fiery chariots is a legacy I would rather loose. One star."
"I can't believe they charged me $2 for this 2 minute ""free sneak peek #2"" ?! Any ""sneak peak"" should be free and this series is already running out of interesting topics."
"As with all episodes in this increasingly silly series, a quick internet search reveals that there is no credibility to the claims of ""crystal skull enthusiasts"". The peddlers of this series do not give their audience much credit. They think we will not check them out. They are wrong.I do check them out and their production does not check out.The only reason to watch this episode is to see how biased and inaccurate these ""Ancient Aliens"" are. When you are done watching this episode you will be left with the ""Ancient Alien Enthusiasts"" conclusions that mystical crystal skulls of ancient origin have been found and are sizzling and popping with paranormal powers and that the mother of them all is the ""Skull of Doom"".Here are the true facts that were easily available and well known to all of the writers, producers and commentators of this program are NEVER presented in this program. These facts were unearthed by a legitimate set of producers, writers and commentators at National Geographic who aired a well-documented legitimate documentary two years before this illegitimate and completely undocumented nonsense was put together by the ""Ancient Alien Enthusiasts"".The National Geographic documentary is called ""The Truth Behind: The Crystal Skulls"" and it completely debunks the nonsense of crystal skulls. Crystal skulls have been conclusively proven not to be ancient. The first crystal skull every produced was manufactured in the latter half of the 19th century. Crystal skulls are not something ancient people had anything to do with. They are irrefutably not of any paranormal origin and they certainly have nothing to do with extraterrestrial beings which of course don't exist except in the imaginations of people with hairdo challenges.Crystal skulls were never created by ancient people for any reason at any time in any part of the world.The purported origin of the most famous crystal skull peddled as the ""Skull of Doom"" and officially known as the Mitchell-Hedges Skull is a 100% pure fabricated hoax. But the little old lady peddling the hoax seemed utterly believable. Even some of the best legitimate scientists were unable to summarily dismiss the little old lady's story.The skull was the icon of Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious [X] series and is shown on the opening screen of each episode. If the little old lady piqued the interest of the totally legitimate scientist Arthur C. Clarke (who did not know the facts of it's fraudulent origins and only presented what was known at the time) there is reason to investigate the story in a serious way.It was difficult to do hard probing when the hoaxer was a very believable cute little old lady named Anna Mitchell-Hedges who seemed so instantly reliable that on first meeting her you'd trust her to babysit your kids without any further references.But she was an absolute fraud! Whether deluded or wickedly deceptive, and in possible collusion with her father, she fabricated a fantastically believable story of how she acquired the crystal skull by seeing a glimmer in the depth of some Mayan ruins in Belize on her 17th birthday (a detail she always included in telling the story which I thought a bit unusual; you'd expect to find her leaving out the birthday detail once in awhile but she never failed to mention it).We now know she never visited the site of the excavation in which she claims to have found the skull. Another clue that something was amiss is that she always mispronounces excavation as ""escavation""in interviews. This always made me wonder about her and her father's actual level of training which we now know was nonexistent. Her father was nothing more than an exotic traveler who had no professional training in any field even remotely related to archaeology.The truth is her father bought the skull at auction and the records of the sale exist to confirm it. The skull was made by a European sculptor who used a European person's skull as the model. Anna Mitchell-Hedges was either delusional or deceptive as was her father. Although her father seems to have held back on perpetuating the hoax, he did include a false reference to the skull as being Mayan in his first autobiography but removes the reference in subsequent editions. And he did not peddle the lie about the skull being an ancient Mayan artifact found in Belize unlike his cunning/delusional daughter did her whole life.My personal opinion based on Anna Mitchell-Hedges obsession with stating that she found the crystal skull on her birthday is that her father gave the skull to her as a birthday present. And he did not just give it to her but planted it in some genuine ruins that Anna Mitchell-Hedges had to actually dig through and so she got to feel the thrill of finding an ancient artifact which she also mentions each and every time she tells the story.The ""ruins"" were known by Anna Mitchell-Hedges not to be in Belize and the skull was known not to be a genuine ancient origin. But Anna Mitchell-Hedges wanted the story to be true and so she embellished it and elaborated a bit more each time she told it. Every other so-called mystic crystal skull has an equally faulty story behind its origin and paranormal properties.None of the above facts are presented in this episode and remember: all of the above facts were readily and easily available to anyone with an internet connection at the time they produced this utterly valueless episode of ""Ancient Alien Whatever"".What a waste of time this lowest quality program has become."
"I detest streaming videos. Where is the DVD set for the 2013 Dallas season 2? I want the hard copy. Not some virtual version controlled by a 3rd Party. Consumers need to stand their ground to ensure we continue to have the option of DVD's for our movies & TV episode seasons.Fortunately, I did tape every episode on VHS as a precaution just in case they pulled a dirty trick like this. Season one was immediately available on DVD at the end of the broadcast season. But season 2 is nowhere to be seen. No evidence they plan to offer DVD's at all for season 2.I don't use DVR's because those are worse. As an example, the network was able to have the cable & sat providers delete a controversial episode of Jesse Ventura's conspiracy theory from every DVR it had been recorded on. These deletions surgically occurred across multiple providers who claimed it was a software upgrade glitch which deleted this one particular episode on the same week, about 2 months after it was aired, from the DVR's of every customer which had recorded via DVR.  Fortunately, mine was on VHS where they couldn't get to it. There were hundreds of viewers complaining in the online forums how that episode was deleted on all of their DVR's despite using different providers. You can probably still find these complaints online.This is just one example of the drawbacks of soft copies like streaming video, DVR & instant episodes. Even if the DVR was disconnected, a command can be inserted to delete an episode the next time the unit is accessed.  At any future point, these can be remotely deleted with simple commands. Many years ago, I was on the original design team for these DVR & interactive set top boxes for the cable & sat companies. The capabilities for these devices are far more invasive than anyone can imagine. Why do you think they give away these DVR boxes. I specifically purchased plain set top boxes from direct TV which do not have DVR's. Also, by owning the equipment, they cannot arbitrarily upgrade or change anything.This info will likely mean nothing to you until it is too late; after one of your recorded episodes has been deleted without warning & blamed on some glitch. All it takes is the fear of a lawsuit for a network to order the discreet elimination of some episode without warning.Also, avoid Ultraviolet DVD's which install spyware on your computer & can delete other movies & videos on your computer which is determined not to meet certain standards. You should be able to find comments on this website which pertain to the drawbacks of Ultraviolet.Fighting to insist on DVD versions for movies & TV just may be the last vestige of control remaining between the public & absolute control of providers. Once you lose those freedoms to choose; they wont come back.Welcome to the ""1984"" version of a controlled society."
"As most people find themselves rooting for the underdog, a couple who are Russian spies in the U.S.  I can't root, nor watch this, I'm in conflict over the fact that I'm an American.  I'm caught between rooting for the FBI guy to catch the couple and the couple.  Wouldn't recommend any American to watch it."
"The show starts out with a scene of consensual sex (oral sex). Later, the woman who was performing the oral sex is shown in a flashback.. being raped. I didn't even make it through the first episode. I am concerned about so many people tolerating so much these days. Fairly graphic sex and violence in shows like this can lead to an increase in appetite for more intensely graphic sex and violence.  I realize most people don't care at all what they watch, or give any thought to what they watch, and will just sit there and absorb anything. It's too bad. I think it is wise for all of us to be careful what we put in our minds.  I don't think the average person will watch a show like this, then go out and rape someone. But, I think watching such things does have a negative effect on us in some way."
"Just a bad show overall. I tried to like it, but a lot about the show was just off. VERY off. I could suspend belief and understand that the family was deep undercover. However, once you look deeper, you will see how poorly constructed the plot is. It's a color-by-numbers ripoff of the Breaking Bad and Shield formula, except it's not about meth or crooked cops. These so-called undercover spies operate like the mafia. All of it is ridiculously transparent, plus guess what, the FBI agent on the lookout for guys like them lives next door!!!I find it hard to believe anyone could possibly enjoy this show!"
"We will NOT watch just any piece of garbage they come up with to put on TV! I always preview anything for my family to watch to make sure there is no &#34;surprises&#34;. This &#34;surprise&#34; was right there at the very beginning of the show!that is as far as I got. If you want. good, decent, quality viewing....do not watch this.If you enjoy trash and garbage..this is for you."
I HAD NO  IDEA HOW OVER THE TOP with sex and violnce this series would be . i will not watch again
I am a God fearing woman and sex scenes are not what I want to watch so I changed the show immediately.
I DON'T CARE TO WATCH PEOPLE HAVING SEX OR KILLING EACH OTHER.  MIGHT BE AN INTERESTING SHOW WITHOUT ALL THAT.  I WATCHED THE FIRST EPISODE AND WASN'T IMPRESSED MUCH. DECIDED TO GIVE IT ONE MORE CHANCE SO I STARTED TO WATCH THE SECOND EPISODE AND SHUT IT OFF AT THE BEGINNING.  LIKE I SAID: TOO MUCH SEX AND VIOLENCE.  NOT ENTERTAINING AT ALL!
"I got so bored that i turned the thing off about 1/4 of the way through.  Sorry, not for me"
I lived in this era and it is particularly hard to watch such a bad portrayal of the events and the times.
"This show qualifies as a brainless cult garbage tv series . Wooden acting , cartoonish looking cover and makeup , the writers wouldn't know a good script if they saw one , and this is just directionless , pointless and stupid show ."
"This movie was really rather predictable. Even the ending, I had a sense of the last minutes of the film, in the first 10 minutes.Really interesting idea for a movie, but it was not executed very well. It is a little like SAW films, but less entertaining, and with a plot that is totally transparent.The acting was pretty poor, the characters where never developed, you never even find out the reason each character is there except the main one. It is almost a half finished film in that regard. It is very short, I can not help but wonder if they chopped off an hour or so of the film.While the camera work is not low budget. Everything else about the film is. A lot of opportunities for any kind of special effects are skipped with the camera cutting away, then the results seen.At the time of me writing this, the movie had 5 stars. Though the movie is not exactly 1 star, it is more like 2, I can not justify giving it two stars. Because someone might actually think it is worth renting. IT IS NOT.At best this is a Sci-fi channel movie. It is as bad as a B-Movie but with none of the charm, or quirks that really make those types of films enjoyable.Please do not rent this movie. But if you do, be prepared to write a review, so others do not make the same mistake. If proving me wrong is worth $6.99 by all means go for it. But there are much better ways to spend your money. This is not worth 6.99 to own let alone rent."
"I would rather eat toe jam football from the south end of a northbound rhino, or smell the breath of a stank, non brushed whino, and that would all be just fine'o, rather than ever watch this movie again!!!! Not even close to Hostel, or Saw quality....save your money folks!!!!"
it was an unknown to known movie to be known of i did not understand the opinion of the flick and i want to give it a one star for the grouping...
"The film begins with a young man wandering down a large, Mexican thoroughfare with a stricken expression on his face. A massive carnival -- fireworks, puppets, costumes, crowded frivolity -- billows around him as he stops and asks, over and over, where he can get a boat. Everyone points him down the street a ways. He wanders in that direction for a bit before stopping to ask yet another person. Over and over. Finally he finds a man in a bar who agrees to rent him his personal boat that he uses for work. The man goes back to his motel room (and pregnant wife) pleased. The next day, he finds the man at the dock, and without making any kind of real arrangements -- no paperwork, no discussion about where he's going, no ID, just a wad of cash handed over -- the couple takes the boat and sails off into some seriously bombastic opening credits, the kind that think volume is a good substitute for craft.I'm not sure what the point of this very drawn-out, very misleading intro was meant to be, but it neatly summarizes a lot of what's wrong with this film. It has a broken-ankle pacing, too much information is left out and what isn't is both repetitive and misleading, and never is there a real sense of who these people are, what they want to do, and what's going on around them. It gets worse when they land on an island that appears to be populated only by children of sinister intent.I'll grant you, the bones of the story aren't too shabby. In abler hands -- with stronger dialogue, more believable characters, and kids that can actually act -- the film could've been quite a thrill. It's just that the movie has nothing more going for it than its central concept, which is really just a kernel of what it should be. None of the concepts or ideas that surround it are explored. No real lessons are learned. Even when people are (ostensibly) running for their lives, it feels like nothing is at stake. Perhaps that's because the editing is so choppy, or the soundtrack is so inconsistent and in-your-face, or the characters are so featureless, or the attempts at gore and shock are mostly just intrusive and laughable. In any event, the end result is just dull."
"It is sad, but I couldn't watch it with my kids, because of the language and some of the videos with nudity.  I really think it should be rated PG13"
Was very disappointed. We were looking for a series we could watch w our teens. Had too much offensive material to continue.
this just didn't excite me.  poor language skills.  characters weren't exciting.  I didn't even make it through the first episode
My son started to watch it and told me he skipped some parts. I just shut it off. Could have been so much better without some of the shots.
"I guess the most disappointing aspect that I really found despicable and I watched most of the series - was the obvious hatred of Christians written in by series writers.  All male Christians in the series were portrayed as sniveling cowards that cried like &#34;little girls&#34; throughout the series. In addition, there was an obvious flaunting of sexual perversion against the priest that, although a sniveling coward is kept like a pet by Ragnah.  He and his wife mock the priest by inviting him in their bed, something Vikings of that time would never have done.  Just some more Hollywood perversion portrayed as historical fact by anti-Christian bigots."
"Since it was a FREE show I clicked and watched. I really tried to get into this show, being a fan of this genre and all, but nope it sucked. I will not be buying Season 2. Same ole' plot Hollywood tends to lace EVERY piece of crap movie/series they create with. They can write a show about Neanderthals (cavemen) and it would be the same crap (oh wait, they did!).....I can name at least 15 movies that are EXACTLY the same as this ole' mess. Besides that, the show was very violent & bloody. I understand that Vikings were filthy disgusting uncivilized feral savages, but d@mn! I felt some kind of way, about seeing a room full of defenseless cowering &#34;Priests&#34; being butchered while crying & begging for their lives (anyone who enjoyed that, and judge me for not, is nothing but a sick sadist) Then the horrific scene at that Viking temple (good lawd!) Seriously, the &#34;fake blood&#34; expense must have accounted for a 3rd of the budget. I found nothing likable about ANY of the characters on this show.... I smh at how these Hollywood writers (as always) try to make the villains look favorable (but then this is part of the &#34;agenda&#34; to further desensitize people to violence & sexual situations). That Ragnarock (whatever his name was) and his crew were nothing but a bunch of savage serial killers & rapist. I also REALLY didn't enjoy looking at dirty sweaty greasy gross lice infested people who looked like they smelled like cattle. Whom all slept in the same beds & had sex in the same room where their children were sleeping. I keep seeing reviews comparing this show to &#34;Game of Thrones&#34;. G.O.T is messy & bloody with similar plots, but between the two, G.O.T is 5-Stars compared to this one.For all of you that feel the need to defend Viking culture & the like. If HALF of what I've read about Viking culture is true, there is absolutely NOTHING to be proud of being a descendant of these people. They were horrible violent feral savages both male & female.P.S. I couldn't careless about those of you that have nothing better to do than criticize peoples 1-Star reviews. So !@&# you in advance. Good night."
"My title says it all.  Perhaps I just didn't have the patience to get further into the story but, after the heroine (wife of the main Viking prince) dispatches two rape-intent clods so neatly, I knew I was in no mood for fantasy.  Maybe episode two would have been better but I didn't care enough to sample it."
"Although hopes are raised by some parts of the opening episode, rather like the opening of Gladiator, the episode and the series rapidly discards its potential for excellence and becomes a humdrum piece of nonsense.  Reminiscent of Nicholas &#34;one expression&#34; Cage, the lead actor does little except adopt his Blue Steel face and look knowingly heroic and invincible through the rest of the series of implausible confrontations, illogical  plot sequences and anachronistic feminist episodes.  They may have got the haircuts right but the larger representation of the Viking style and culture is laughably misunderstood and misrepresented by standard plot mechanisms that could be transported to any age,such as the lone hero/Roman/detective/office worker who stands up to the one-dimensional evil boss/lord/king/Caesar, while supported by the strong woman and the loyal side kick, proving others wrong at every turn and always being right in his single-minded and, again. one dimensional righteousness.  Abnormally disappointing."
I love cooking competition shows.  But this one gets on my nerves with the (really bad) &#34;jokes&#34; and with the Chairman's antics....really didn't like it.  Obviously a lot of folks disagree with me as it is now in its 8th season.  Just wasn't my taste.
"This shows takes about 4 breaks and at each return totally recaps the entire previous segments.  Not just with talking but showing all the houses they've already seen, over and over and over again.  After each break we hear about the couple, why they are looking for a new house, what are their needs, why they liked and disliked the previous house.  The result is that you don't spend much time seeing the actual houses.  This was a great idea for a show, part travel show.  But I couldn't stand all the recaps."
"How can they rename a movie and then say it is being released before in theaters!  That is really a rip off.  That is so insulting, this movie was made in 2009 and is not being released in theaters. We are being played for money!  They should be more honest with us the renters and viewers. I am seriouisly offended, because I have spent a lot of money on Amazon rentals and purchases and trusted them."
We watched only one episode but found this to be too dark and depressing for us.  A bit uncomfortable with the relationship between mom Bates and her son Norman.  Not recommended.
Yuck... were do I start. Nothing made me want to watch the ten episodes over. The scences of mother and son sleeping in the same bed are really creepy. Poor guy.
"my daughter got this show without asking..i dont even care to see it..It looks like hype to me. I didnt see any  bevies of smokin hotties (like on the cover) at the Navy Exchange, but rather what they refer to as small herds of dependapotamus's roaming the aisles blocking traffic with their extremely wide pondunkadunks...just sayin... ;-)"
"Zero stars if I could. Actually, NEGATIVE FIVE stars if I could.Wow. I can't believe how bad this film was. It actually became excruciating about halfway through. I had to force myself to keep watching it, so that I could write a review. This film should be taken down immediately, and all copies, draft materials, and anything else related to it should be destroyed. It cannot be salvaged. You'd be better off starting from scratch, than trying to save this film. This is one of the most detestable, deplorable, despicable movies I have ever seen that has tried to tout itself as a ""family film"". Good grief it was bad. How bad was it? The most morally admirable character was the VILLAIN, ""The Flamingo"", and he's obviously not that morally upright. I would say that this film was written by a disbarred lawyer, but even disbarred lawyers are familiar with the basics of ethics and morality. The writers of this film seem to have no understanding, nor familiarity with ethics.Perhaps the greatest reason that superheroes are a classical storytelling device is the fact that they offer the opportunity to draw clear delineations between what is right, and what is wrong. Superheroes often face moral dilemmas, but what makes them superheroes is the fact that they make the right choices, no matter how hard it is to do what's right. Otherwise, they're superVILLAINS. Superpowers, super abilities, and super tech do not make superheroes. CHOICES make superheroes.Now let's examine the choices that this ""superhero"" family makes.Although the father recognizes that he needs to ""protect his family from a murderous mainframe"", when faced with the financial repercussions of possibly losing his house, he caves stating ""fine, just don't blow up my house"". So, finances trump family? Got it.Furthermore, the father loses any reluctance about the arrangement with the ""murderous mainframe"" once it becomes obvious to him that he can use the Grim Avenger tech to make his personal life better by using it for chores.After seriously scorching his neighbor's house using a laser to trim hedges, rather than try to repair the damage, or make reparations, or even confess to it, he runs and hides like the deadbeats who hit someone's parked car in the parking lot and leave without taking responsibility.The wife agrees to go to (in her own words) ""a dinner date"" at one of the most expensive restaurants in town alone with her gorgeous playboy coworker. All of the professional, married women that I know don't eat meals with nor travel with male coworkers alone, but only in a group.When it becomes apparent to the father that ""The Flamingo"" is rampaging across the city in order to force a showdown, the father chooses to address largely invented family emergencies instead, at the cost to countless other families.To spy on his wife on her dinner date with Richard, the father implants a Grim Global Positioning Tracker in Richard, even though he's at first horrified by the danger of implanting it in someone's spinal cord (but, hey, it's okay if you don't like the guy, right?) because he's ""protecting his family"". Evidently, trust for your spouse isn't requisite in protecting your family. (And later he ironically berates the computer for invading his daughter's privacy by checking Facebook.)The father, rather than allow Richard to drive away with his wife, destroys Richard's Corvette.The son, upon acquiring one of Grim Avenger's power gauntlets, and after destroying a neighbor's treehouse, rather than make reparations, or a confession, cuts and runs (perhaps taking a cue from his father's lack of moral compass).The son uses the power gauntlet to bully a bully (becoming the evil that he had resented and detested).The father constantly shirks his end of the bargain, doing everything that he can to avoid training and crime fighting.The father uses the ""Hypno Spray"" to brainwash the most popular boy at his daughter's school in order to completely reform him and force him to be his daughter's boyfriend, then congratulates himself with ""THAT's how to parent!""The father uses the x-ray goggles to cheat at the scratch-off lottery, by finding winning tickets.The son and daughter abandon her tasered, unconscious boyfriend on their porch, because they're busy fighting over who gets the power gauntlet.The father uses the Grim Avenger super car just to get to his wife's dinner in the city, then uses the Grim Avenger persona to save her presentation by offering the persona for marketing purposes. (Then berates his children for using the super car to cheat ""whenever things get hard"", but never realizes how hypocritical that is.)The father allows his children to use the super car to get to school, so that he can continue to do marketing as the Grim Avenger for his wife. (Then is surprised when they abuse it to skip school and become more popular.) This also potentially endangers his family by exposing his secret identity, but the show never addresses this. It also eventually leads to ""The Flamingo"" gaining control of the super car, but fortunately for the city all he cares about is revenge, otherwise the city would have been screwed, no thanks to our ""heroes"".The daughter uses the automated super car to cheat and pass her driver's exam.The son speculates about selling Grim Avenger tech on eBay for money.The son uses tattling about his sister's using the super car to pick up friends so that he can get out of trouble for skipping school.The father puts his children in danger by pursing criminals with them just to show them how important of a responsibility it is (even though it's the first time that he's bothered to do any crime fighting).In answering his last chance questions, the father makes it clear in his answers that his family comes first, no matter the cost to society and the city. The movie deems that to be a virtue. What happens to the superhero (or superspy) families that were willing to put their families on the line for others? That viewed the well-being of society as higher than their own well-being? Since when is selfishness a virtue? Disregard for others? Unwillingness to sacrifice?The family abandons a helpless, tied-up Richard in the same warehouse that had previously exploded and killed the prior Grim Avenger.The movie tries to have a huge moment at the end in the final fight where the father ""realizes"" a bunch of things like ""heroes don't need masks"", but he doesn't actually realize anything meaningful. He comes off as a groundlessly cocky jerk, not someone who has been on a revelatory journey. It's trite, with all of the moral goodness of twinkies.The movie ends with the family continuing to try to find ways to pimp out the Grim Avenger persona for marketing money. (Then the father laughably asserts at the end of the film that ""This city needs us"" even though the opposite has been shown throughout the entire film.)So how's ""The Flamingo"" the most morally upright? He goes out of his way to make sure that his actions don't cause physical harm, almost to a laughable degree. On the other hand, the ""superhero"" family runs him over with a car, uses the ""Hypno Spray"" on him to brainwash him so that he can become their personal lawn care help rather than turning him in to authorities, and when the ""Hypno Spray"" wears off, they have a deadly robot ready to threaten him with physical harm if he doesn't trim their hedges. Nice. I'm so glad that a family with such a high regard for human life, and no propensity for abusing power has been granted so much power. (Please note the sarcasm. Please?)Much of this would have been fine if there had been morals to any of these experiences where the family learned that what they had done was wrong, and that there are more important things in life than themselves. This isn't the case at all. It's the opposite. Everything works out despite them not learning any lessons, and merely reinforces that they can cavalierly do whatever they want at the expense of any others. Most of the immoral and unethical things that this family does end up having ZERO negative consequences for the family (although, the same cannot be said for the innocent public who is saddled with this supervillain family).The problem with this film concept is that the family is detestable. The computer is right: they don't deserve access to the Grim Avenger's tech. They abuse it, and constantly put others in danger as a result. Their most dominant trait is family selfishness (they aren't necessarily selfish individually, but their family as a group acts selfishly towards the rest of the world). They act as if their family and the happiness of the family justify any other type of action, no matter the repercussions for the rest of the world. If this family has to choose between either doing the right thing OR being happy, this family inevitably chooses to be selfishly happy. This family is closer to a family of supervillains, then a family of superheroes. Like supervillains, they use their powers for family gain rather than for the betterment of society.This show is detestable for its lack of ethics, and tone deafness, and is likely unsalvageable. Relegate the whole concept to the trash heap, or be honest, and make a show glamorizing a supervillain family."
Did bot finish watching this it was a boring cartoon. Amazon made a mistake this one.  Should habe had real people and real breast.
"I have always been intrigued by the Amityville killings and the hauntings (i.e. ""Horror""). I have found the film itself to be one of the better made horror films in its genre due to its supposed true story. I even red the Jay Ansen book and found that just as scary. Even if in the back of my mind, my beliefs through the years have turned a little cynical with the validity of this tale, my child-brain still believes in a fascinated way. So I continue to explore some new information.This new entry into the world of the Amityville Drama is about Daniel Lutz, step-son of George and son Kathy Lutz. Throughout the film, Daniel emphasizes his hate towards George. He is filled with anger at almost every step and seems to never let go of this, despite his therapeutic efforts to either resolve the issue or at least get to the truth of it.This documentary does neither to explore the truth or his own personal anger, but rather carries the torch that George and Kathy had started out in 1979 about the hauntings of the house. His descriptions of the happenings in the house are virtually a verbatim of either the book or the movie. If anyone knows anything about Hollywood ""true stories"" they almost never follow the reality in favor of embellishment for the entertainment value, as well never follow the narrative of a book as some things are unfit for movie adaptations for purposes of translating. So what we are left with is an angry guy who decides to take his own cut of the Amityville Horror in the wake of his parents death.The documentary filmmaker, Lauren Dido (?), does not seem to uncover anything. Nor does she ask the right questions. But just incites Daniel half of the time. It is almost as if this is just another scam, in the same way George, Kathy and Jay put together the book and later the movie. This telling, however, is much less successful. I think for those who just need to find out what is in this documentary will want to watch it despite any review will have to decide for themselves about what is in this. Even though I fall into that category, I personally found it dull, boring and insulting."
"Daniel Lutz is probably the most annoying person I have ever seen in a documentary. He comes off as obnoxious and immature.  To make matters worse it seemed like a vanity piece for him and because of that the rest of the movie felt and probably was a sham.  It was just a way for him to make a quick buck and get some attention.  The shots of him playing guitar were totally unnecessary and I really could not find one likeable thing about this man.  I have never seen a documentary where the main subject has not one redeeming quality.  Well, this was a first for me because by the end I still couldn&#8217;t see anything about Mr. Lutz that made me want to root for him.  In fact it was quite the opposite.  I hope this was his 15 minutes and we never have to hear or see from him again.It was very hard to sit through and I didn&#8217;t believe one word he said.  He actually reminded me of a prison inmate that would say anything to get parole."
"Perhaps it's because I'm a Fire Fly and Star Trek junkie, but this series was not impressive to me at all. I got tired of the constant close ups of the girl's ludicrous eyes. Whatever plotline the series was supposed to have never advanced an inch. I felt like I was swimming in mud with each episode I watched."
"The premise sounded good, and the story line for the premiere was also very good, but I find the needless nudity that was in the premier and then again in the second episode made me decide I didn't want to watch this series after all.  It and coarse language are always a sign of a weak script.  When the writing is good, these elements are unneeded.  I was very disappointed."
Story line sounded good but fifteen minutes into the first episode the show &#34;lost the plot&#34; and became just another soap opera with sex taking up way too much time.
"This show lacks originality, the movement of the storyline is weak, the characters are not engaging, and the special effects would be ok for cutscenes in a 90s videogame.  It feels like a typical tv series that doesn't stand out in anyway.  I apologize for suggesting that a 7 year old couldn't write a better show, I know plenty that could."
It was drivel so I quit watching. Really if there was a point to it all I would have hung on. It was a &#34;wanna be&#34; cross between the show Revolution and Falling Skies. But not nearly as good.
"I just dished out a $1.99 for this GARBAGE.This show is full of bad acting ,bad make up and a bad story line.Unfortunately this seems to have become the norm among TV.I have never been so bored in my life , even on fast forward this thing goes nowhere.I bought it because it got 4 stars - just who is rating this crap?People over 12 should have a bit more sense.And please - Where is the Science in Sci-Fi?It was a waste of major time and little money, but I sure am NOT watching any more of this crap.SyFy had a lot of decent shows in the past that got cancelled , I can just hope this one doesn't make it past the few episodes they have."
terrible - how do people even get money to film this PC garbage? why must i drone on about how bad this is just make the minimum word requirement?
"I just watched the my first episode of Kitchen Impossible and Robert actually made the place worse.  If I was the owner, I would have sued him for putting the final nail in this dated restaurant's coffin.  The decor looked cheap and very unprofessional.  There is no way you can do what he attempts to do in 48 hours and in this case he proved that right.  Having said that the owner of the restaurant gets what he deserves if he trusted this guy in the first place.At least when Gordon Ramsey takes on a restaurant he gives them a professional remodel not a cheap job that will probably fall apart in less than a month.  It's just totally reckless the way they slapped this place together.  My bet is that most of it is destroyed by now.He was right about one thing.  The chairs looked disgusting.  I would not hire these two so called decorators to do the men's room in the subway."
"I have special interest in real state and this show provide me a  good points to get to know the value of properties in North America , and also ideas to improve my own property."
"Just an awful, AWFUL boring disappointment of a movie.  I was expecting a film expert(s) insights on what the movie meant, on-screen interviews and a real dissection of what the movie meant and the hidden meanings of things and what went in to it by people who really know what they are talking about. Instead I got scenes from other Kubrick films, played against random voiceovers of people who sound like they were nerds sitting in their barcaloungers in their parents' basement talking about how much the movie meant to them.  A huge, HUGE letdown pile of nonsense.  Real disappointment."
"As the camera slowly moves in on Danny brushing his teeth, there, on the left side of the wall is a sticker of Dopey from Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Later, after Danny is revealed by Toby some of the incidents that will occur at the Overlook Hotel, it would appear that the sticker is no longer there. The ""theorist"", by way of narration, explains that Danny is ""no longer a dope"". Yup, this theory and more abound in ROOM 237, a supposedly insightful, highly subjective, examination of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.I was not really sure what to expect. Will I hear about symbolism? Hidden gestures by Kubrick to reveal the larger truth of the film? An explanation of the film itself and what some of the more mysterious moments meant? You will not be treated to any of these things that one might assume at face value. In fact, nothing that is ""revealed"" has anything to do with the movie. Apparently all of the theories relate to some outside dilemma that Kubrick (presumably) was grappling with and felt the need to embed these ideas in this film. Why that is the case no one answered.If anyone has seen the documentary Kubrick's Odyssey, they will well learn that Kubrick faked the moon landing for Nasa using the same effects as in 2001, and that, for keeping this a secret, he revealed clues laid out throughout the movie in this film. In ROOM 237, the same author retells much of that theory in this film so it might be redundant.Other theories regard its a film about the Holocaust, the genocide of the American Indians, or the mythological Minotaur. Or you just need to watch the film forward and backward simultaneously. All of these theories might be interesting on their own with no regard to content or context. Together they are just a mash of ideas with no thread in place. One even wonders if The Shining is a basis for their conclusions or if its just their own fanatical ideas being projected onto a very psychological playing field.It becomes clear that these 5 people who admire Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, know how to inspect the film and its intricate details, but do not seem to know how to watch a film. Or at least interpret properly the language of cinema. What they explain gives the view no insights into the film itself, nor of Stanley Kubrick. Beginning with the obvious, that Jack Nicholson's character slowly goes mad from isolation might be a good place to start to draw the viewer in their thinking. Instead we are slapped with obscure objects in the background that is faintly paid attention to by most casual viewers.Because of this, I cant help but feel that all these interpretations are complete non-sense and have no place in a serious discussion of the film. The film is almost a joke and I wonder if the director is exploiting these people who seriously believe in their theories? It would be sad that Kubrick's film was used to make such a joke by the director. If he believes anything these theorists propose, then the director needs to revisit a book on symbology. I can't recommend this film, but I suspect ardent Kubrick fans will want to see it and understandably so. If that is the case, then it is not a terrible viewing. Have a beer, friends and some good laughs."
"...is how someone actually put up money for this cavalcade of half-baked theories?Clearly someone had too much time on their hands. Why not help to fight hunger or illiteracy?I stayed with this until the deconstruction of the &#34;secret hard-on&#34; scene. Maybe the producers have enough time on their hands to make it, but I certainly don't have the time to sit through it. Life is too short. Really dumb."
"They may only eat plants, but these guys have a thirst for blood. It is like the hunger games for children."
I was intrigued by the dramatization of the series at the movie theatre but this TV episode is just awful. I have had enough. Nothing further need be said!
What type of sick mind can think up this type of serial killer garbage...probably the type who should be locked up
"Hannibal is bad, unless you like to see body pars being prepared for food and classical music playing in the background. Very boring, should be canceled very soon. Networks would do better with Zombie projects like the Walking Dead, Please no more CSI network programs."
"I suffered through 3 episodes of this show with an acid-filled stomach, and then it became too much for me to bear. I do watch other crime-solving shows, but there was something just insidiously....evil about this one. I understand on an intellectual level that the premise of the show is clever, but it wasn't enough to overcome the disturbing feeling that stayed with me for hours after I watched an episode. I cannot POSSIBLY be the only ex-viewer who felt that way. Films and TV shows are getting more and more disgusting and extreme, to the point where I wonder if Hollywood will make actual ""snuff"" films sometime in the not-too-distant future, in order to maintain the sick thrill for the viewer. This is one show that will have to go on without me."
"Okay, this is very well written and acted but the character of Hannibal is so evil and depraved that I never want to watch another episode."
Hey america this is the dumbing down you demand. This show is complete trash. Just glorifies murder and cannibalism. Its not clever or unique and it is repulsive you will love it.
"Breaks the first rule of good story telling, namely telling.  Explains everything, showing noting.  Cutesy isn't necessary for kids.  Cutesy is what adults create for kids because adults think kids are cute.  Kids don't think of themselves as cutesy.  They appreciate silly humor and things they can identify with.  Stop explaining everything, just show it.  Kids will get it."
"Please do not equate science to bombs...this is very bad timing, I must say having a relative severely injured by a bomb in Boston."
"Silly attempt at some veiled social statement. Diversity 101 on Steroids?  Exceptionally cheesy and without merit. A junkyard kitchen? Girls do Science poster movie?  It is great to give kids a break from reality, but when it becomes so deluded by the politically correctness and social massage that it is delusional, then kids lose. A pidgeon with a rocketpack? Okay --what did Nancy say?  JUST SAY NO!"
"First, I liked the premise of a little black girl and boy brother sister team solving problems.  I view shows before my children.  It seems the show was written by someone who does not know children.  I was offended that you would have the gall to have two black children solving a math problem and have it end on a watermelon floor.  You cant have a show without a male that is doing something positive.  Really???!!! a young black male child named sam on a watermelon floor.  Just say sambo and get it over.  sam could not speak up for him self, he lost his rabbit, he never acomplished pushing a button and his sister solved the problem.  you also have the white male bully.  Nice premise. racist delivery.Pilot [HD]"
"Because I don't let my kids watch too much TV (or me for that matter), I make sure the kid shows are either something that I'd like to watch with them (""Phineas and Ferb"") or something that is of educational value (""Super Why"").""Positively Ozitively"" does not meet that criteria. If this show were to be watched in my household it either has to have smart humor for both adults and children, OR it has to teach something other than a ""life lesson"" - it needs to teach reading, math, science, or science.I was looking forward to this show when I first heard about it, but I am afraid I'm going to have to pass."
"Standing on the shoulders of the Wizard of Oz is not enough to make this show interesting. There's plenty of better/new ideas that warrant an entire show, like Tumbleaf."
"I will only let my daughter watch shows that I can stand to sit through. Creative Galaxy is not one of them. It's so dumbed down, as are most things for kids. It felt like it was geared towards the mentally retarded. I was looking for a segment that was visually complete, but I don't think there was one. Everything looked half done and a mishmash of ideas. It was just plain ugly. I'll just stick to Pocoyo."
"Even though I don't usually enjoy animated series, I thought I'd give this a viewing.  The show was silly, the characters a bit too stereotypical, and the animation wasn't the best.  But I think the main probelm was I am not the right demographic, too old probably.  this will probably appeal to a younger audience."
I did not like this at all. I don't really like the modern adult cartoon comedies and this is just as bad or worse than the rest.
"This was just painful to watch.  I am reminded of the repetitious stereotypical-based skits that make up the majority of the bile-generating torture that is Saturday Night Live; however, SNL has the occasional performance that makes all of the suffering worth while.  This show has no saving grace."
"I couldn't even bring myself to begin to start to even consider thinking about maybe watching this show. I seriously have no idea what the other reviewers saw that made them want to watch this but everyone is entitled to their own opinion I suppose. I hope to never see this preview, show, picture of the show or hear the dumpy white character talk like she is from the ghetto every again or I may turn into a serial killer and murder all the cartoon characters in the world. Really Amazon, this is what you think people will watch??????? Jump over to Netflix and check out House of Cards."
"Didn't really like this one. Granted, there were a few cute moments, but they were overwhelmed by the constant gabbing of the lead protagonists. I just got really annoyed with the ghetto accents. The animation is nothing impressive either. Mostly crude drawings; something you'd find more on adult swim I think. There were too many pop culture references and not enough supernatural aspects to the show. Nothing about this really impressed me and probably wouldn't watch this again."
I can't imagine anybody would think this has ANY redeeming qualities.  Not smart.  Not funny. Not clever.  Not entertaining.  Not gonna get made!
"When the white chick sprayed the giant spider and said &#34;Spida, please&#34;, I was done. Cliche, annoying, you name it."
"Amazon, please stop trying to make TV shows.  You are bad at it, and will lose tons of money.  This show has ugly actors, ugly production values, and they sing.  I skipped the opening song, turned it off after they broke out into another one.  Bad Amazon, bad."
"Bebe Neuwirth is a wonderful actress, and I applaud Amazon for snatching her up, but this insipid show is terribly written and awkward to watch, and by God the actors playing the interns are either terrible or being given terrible material.  Hold on to Bebe, but fire this show."
"The songs are horrible. The premise is that we are cool if we figure out that it is a parody of HuffPo. The writing does not make me happy. I love Bebe Neuwirth as an actor, but I just must stop this waste of money. All of the actors seem funny and capable and they sing well. The talented writers need to find something they love and believe in so it will not ring so hollow. Great quality in execution; the script should have been negated as not being funny."
Terrible show and I don't know why they added the music. Music is like adding something bad to something worse.
"There are so many other better shows that are coming out right now, please don't waste your funding on this. This represents everything that is wrong with all the terrible shows on TV right now. If we could stop wasting our time on terrible shows like this, and start focusing more time on better shows like Those Who Can't or Onion News Empire, then we would have better TV. I vote no thank you for this one."
"The songs are forced and not that good. Then to make up for it, the characters are too over the top.I would not watch this show if it was the pilot they chose to produce."
"From the moment the first terrible song began (off key), the treacle began.  Couldn't finish it.  If you're the type of person who would watch this regularly, my God prevent us from ever hanging out..."
This was a waste of time. Not only was the premise tiresome but also the musical bits. None of the characters was interesting. This is not a show I'd want to see as a series. Awful!
"could not finish it, it's a musical, felt like glee, and I hate glee (yeah I know it's popular).I find myself not caring about any character in this show at all."
"Aside from the stoner asian who is epically funny (""Donuts"" LMAO!!), (and maybe the Rachel from Glee knock off, who is cute), this show and the cast is TERRIBLE. So sorry Bebe, but what were you thinking with that voice? There's no way you could sustain that for an entire season...she must know this is not going anywhere, LOL.Had to really struggle to get through the entire show, was turned off right from the beginning and only stuck in there because the asian girl showed up just as I was about to click it off.Good bye, do not make more episodes. Winnowing week should take them all!"
"I guess if you're a Glee fan, maybe this type of show works for you but I only lasted 2 minutes into the intro when I wanted to change the channel. I guess I haven't enjoyed a show with singing since Ally McBeal. Sorry, I'll have to pass."
"There was nothing about this one that I liked. The characters are obnoxious, the singing is terrible, and the plot makes no sense."
"Bad songs.  We've seen this before.I like the idea of the interns at a magazine, but it'd be much better as a comedy and lose all the songs."
Missed opportunity to be really good. I always like to learn something about the inside of an industry when I watch something like this. Nothing presented itself. The concept was good but the delivery was pretty yoki.
"Not the worst show I have seen on Amazon pilots list, but clearly not the best.  I had no idea Babe N. was still alive - as an actor that is - yowsa!  Show was boring and unfunny."
"It's like there was an ad put on Craigslist calling for a glee clone, but not set in high school.  The thinking process after receiving response on must've been, 'The internet's a popular thing and this show will be on the internet.  Why not make it take place at an internet-based company?'.  It's racist, and it's supposed to take place in New York City.  The non-Caucasian characters are given less songs.  It's predictable and the songs aren't great."
"Cross between Glee x Ugly Betty, yeah, I don't think so.  I believe in diversity, but you can't always appease to everyone."
Is this an updated version of Ugly Betty??  It sure has the look of that show.  I dislike all the characters.  I would never watch this show again.  This is 25 minutes I will never ever...get back!
Now I know why I had never heard of this maybe the dumbest story line ah is there even a story line? And shame on great actors doing this third rate show
"This was honestly the WORST pilot of them all. I watched it twice because the first time I zoned out, but yeah it sucked the second time around too. The pilot is lame: the characters ALL annoying, the concept weak, and the singing a big FAT joke! It's GLEE meets Friends set in the work place, but fingernails across a blackboard irritating on every level, without any enduring qualities. What an utter waste of Bebe Neuwirth's amazing talents. There's no potential here, smh."
This wanna-be glee in the workplace is not worth your time. Very disappointed. Expected more from BeBe. Terrible stereo-types. An insult to music lover's ears.
This mash up does not work. It's office meets smash. Ass in all thats wrong and not funny on Office meets all the bad things that happen on smash. I turned it off half way thru.
"As soon as the show started, I knew it wasn't going to go well.  The musical arrangements in the musical numbers lacks all originality and the lyrics aren't funny or interesting.  It seems that they decided rhyming was enough to make the songs work, but they aren't very good songs and I am not even sure they were trying to make them funny.  The rest of the writing is pretty similar -- while it's not atrocious, there's just no substance and nothing really works.  The premise is decent and the actors all seem capable, but I don't see how this show could work as a series; it's just not funny.  There might be a funny show somewhere in this premise, but the pilot doesn't even show enough promise to warrant a reworking of this material."
"A Glee influenced satire of The Huffington Post...can it honestly get any worse from here? Musical numbers aside, the young actors just are not very good. Remotely, the only saving grace is the actress parodying Ariana Huffington, Bebe Neuwirth (who has done much better work than this!)Sorry, but this is a series I do NOT want to see -- nothing original about it!"
I'd normally write in detail why this was bad but given that I could only watch half the episode I just can't tell you how bad this was indeed.Watched every other pilot too.Find something better Bebe. You deserve it.
"i was out by the second ""song""this is a joke...""every where i look i see a chimpmunk on a waterski"".....ugh"
"This was the only pilot I couldn't finish. It was bad on several accounts. Here's a short list -1. It's a musical. I love good musicals, but I hate bad ones. This is a bad one. The songs aren't catchy and they don't add anything to the story. We don't need another ""Glee.""2. The idea is boring. A show revolving around an internship could be promising. But when the internship only involves searching the web, it's not doing anything for me. It's SO dull.3. The characters fall into cliche stereotypes and I just don't end up giving a damn about any of them.Nothing about this catches my attention. I'm passing on this one."
I made it through almost half of the opening song (probably about a minute and a half).  I should have turned it off after the first 30 seconds.This must be some kind of goof right?
I didn't like it. I'm not a fan of musicals. This would be a good show without all of the singing. Just not my cup of tea.
"Well what else is there to say about a show that starts with ""warning: show contains musical numbers"".  I would never watch this show, I couldn't make it through even one episode.  I found myself horrified and disgusted.  Musicals are for Broadway, not TV."
"The balls on the creators of this show are as big as I've seen since... I dunno, Viva Laughlin, or Glee maybe. When I say this show is a musical, though, I don't mean like those two, where you have the characters singing whatever song from the last 40 years that works in this particular situation, but a wholly original creation (with all of the good and bad things that entails). You don't end up having stupid things like a character singing a slow, ""moving"" cover of Girls Just Want to Have Fun (ask the Glee fans about that), or... well anything that happened in Viva Laughlin, because the songs are written to what the characters are thinking, so you have the inner monologue moments that come with having a musical; the characters emotions truly come out in the songs. Needless to say, if you have a show that relies on newly written songs that much, it would help if they didn't suck, which is the unfortunate hole that Browsers has fallen into. Even Bebe Neuwerth, the original Morticia Addams on Broadway, among many others, couldn't save the song she was given, which gleefully finds a whole bunch of things to rhyme with *Word I Cannot Say in Amazon Reviews*, while failing on a level as a song, and really not doing a good job of telling us about the character. It's a shame she's not used more, as she's channeling Ariana Huffington by way of Portia DeRossi's character in Better Off Ted (look at that costume), but leaning in to neither of them. The other four leads are some variation on a stock comic character, the Rachel Berry, the Stoned, Weird, Net-Friendly Asian, The Awkward Dork, and The Organized, Righteous Black Man. They each get a song (save the latter), each song is uniquely bad in it's own way. Mercifully, they're all much shorter.The plot points are all very familiar, the characters are all very familiar, and the show does nothing with them because it takes time to tell in a few minutes what it could tell in 30 seconds, and the normal saving grace of the musical, catchy, emotion-rending songs, are not there. It's a fascinating failure, and it's definitely Amazon swinging for the fences, but it's a pretty spectacular whiff."
"Preview [HD] I did not enjoy this rather silly comedy/musical. It did not hold my attention and I would not watch it if it were offered on Amazon Prime.  The actors spontaneously breaking out in song did nothing for me.  There are musicals out there that are worth the price and time to watch....but Browsers was not one of them.  I have never cared for Glee either, so I guess its just not my cup of tea when it comes to comedy/musicals in general."
I could only hack ten seconds of this show. It actually made me very nervous and anxious. Singing on the streets of busy NY...Not a good combination...
"This wasn't my cup of tea.  I'm not into musicals, and I can't stand the real Arianna Huffington, let alone a fictional one."
"Clearly not for me since I am not a Gleek or a fan of musicals in general. I fail to see the necessity of of breaking out in song that doesn't enhance the overall storyline, and cannot imagine a show of this calibre having the staying power to survive a season."
"My wife and I turned Browsers off just 10 minutes into the show.  We couldn't watch another minute.  Bad songs, bad dialogue, bad characters."
"I was embarrassed for the actors in this. The writers must have spent about 15 minutes on the concept and script, the songwriters maybe 5 minutes on trite, stupid, and clumsily trying to-, but failing to be clever lyrics with equally banal tunes. Unsure at first whether this was a comedy or a satire of a comedy (which is what?) or a satire of musical comedy in general, I gave it ten more minutes and then just shook my head and stopped watching. Not a single thing original about this show. It misses the mark on all levels."
"Writers and composers - musicals are HARD TO WRITE. A song cannot simply be words that rhyme and happen to have notes attached...they need, like any other story, depth, layers, actual people not just caricatures, and something we can relate to, then they need to have good music to help tell that story. When you have a seasoned Broadway and TV actress like Bebe Neuwirth unable to make it work, you're missing something. This is really painful."
"This was so incredibly annoying that I couldn't stand to keep watching. The singing was mediocre (I'm being nice), the lyrics were lame, and it was boring."
"From the get go, Browsers actually 'warns' it's viewers that it is a musical show.  If your goal is to immediately turn off 60% of your potential audience, then this is a great plan.  BeBe Neuwirth (Frasier's Wife) is the star associated with this Amazon Original.  Her accent isn't appealing.  I should note that i'm not a fan of music based shows, and this one, based upon interns at a news website, is not impressive.  Expect songs about internet meme's that won't have any meaning in a year.  Such as the horrible song ""When I Tweet"".  The Dance sequence at the end is just lame during a song that could be funny, but falls flat on an empty premise of a show."
There are a couple of tv shows with music successfully included in a drama and/or comedy show.  It always seemed to me they go downhill when the singing stops.  This pilot goes downhill from the opening song and either stays there or goes further down.  The songs and singing were mediocre.  The acting and writing was amateurish.  I am embarrassed for Bebe Neurwirth.  She deserves better but should also have known better than to allow herself to be dragged into this muck.  Perhaps out of work older actors have to take jobs beneath their skill level just like a lot of other workers in this economy. Sad.
"Are they really singing? Really? Maybe that's just the opening or something, maybe that's the last of the singing. Nope! Singing again, aannnd, I'm done with this show."
"There are just so many things that are wrong about this show.  I was expecting 30 Rock funny and sarcastic, not cute musical.  I couldn't believe they were serious with the music.  I thought, ""O.K. any minute they'll break and let us in on the music joke.""  But sadly they didn't.  Good voices but this was a mish mash of wrongness."
"Let's make a show like Glee but in an office setting. Instant gold. Right? No.I've got nothing against musicals, but I never liked Glee, and this obvious copycat doesn't do it for me either."
"I'm sorry. I so wanted to like this show since Bebe Neuwirth is starring! But I could not make it past the first scene when she broke out into song. For reference, I don't watch ""Glee"" or ""Smash"" either so this just may not be my thing."
"I did not even make it to the end of this POS.  The gym teacher dude should have been Thomas Lennon.  The one with the beard is tolerable.  Tattoo man needs to go; rather the whole character.  As a teacher, I hate the name of the show.  Do not make any more of this show."
"What public school in America has only young white male teachers and principal -- except for a token elderly female who apparently has narcolepsy and dementia????  There are two attractive young white females (the cafeteria lady and the librarian) as sex-interests.  The pilot included racist, sexist, homophobic, and age-related allusions; what the ratings call STRONG LANGUAGE, and a lot of sex talk.  But the awful part is that it was not funny...barely got a chuckle or two.  This show probably won't appeal to a diverse audience, and certainly not to anyone with taste."
"I watched this and thought it would be funny, but most of the recycled jokes and lack of any truly funny moments made it boring."
"This piece of garbage is totally offensive, not funny in the least, and I couldn't bear to finish it. It epitomizes everything stupid, sad, and dull. I cannot fathom how someone got paid to make a pilot of this, and how it made it to the final set. WORST EVER!"
"There are no likeable characters.The tattooed guy is totally not believable,and what the hell:In the dialog where they are talking about reading books, the tattooed guy is insulting getting an education, while being mockingly called Henry Rollins WHO IS SUPER EDUCATED.Sloppy bad writing, unfunny, boring.don't do it."
"This is the type of comedy I don't really enjoy, over the top silly and a bit mean spirited.  I couldn't finish the pilot, and won't watch more if it goes to series."
This has to be one of the worst pilots I have ever seen.  At no point was the dialogue remotely funny.
You can't be serious. This was awful. Turned off after 5 minutes. Geared to an adolescent humor level. Nuffield said.
Could not follow such a stupid theme.  Doubt it will get much further than this pilot.  Not funny at all.
"I felt the jokes crossed the line and made fun of certain populations.  The script also played into stereotypes, which will not benefit society."
"There is nothing good about this show!!! It's offensive, dumb, not funny and unwatchable!!! I would never watch this if you ordered it!!!!"
"Looking at the reviews I'm definitely counter to most poeple watching this show, but I found absolutely nothing redeeming about the show.  The actors were poor, the direction pointless and I didn't laugh even a single time.  When did pure stupidity become funny?This is one of those shows that you watch and regret because you are now almost 23 minutes dumber than when you started and you will never get that time back."
"Who are the target audience here?!  It is offensive, and not funny at all.  Could not continue for more than 10 minutes.  Tried to give it a chance but the show never got better.  Had bad teachers but this is just outright awful.  It gives teachers such an underserved bad rep and for what. Sorry but I don't get it nor see any comedy value in this."
The title says it all.  I stopped watching this only 10 minutes in.  Immature is a step up for these teachers.  Totally unbelievable and not very funny. Not interested in seeing anymore.
Offensive just for the sake of being offensive. Which I would understand them doing if the show was actually funny. But it wasn't. It was just sad. These teachers represent everything wrong with society. It is not entertaining to watch them swear like a bunch of 5th graders who think they're grown up.
I can't stand comedy that is stupid for the sake of stupid.  Dumb and Dumber and it's ilk make me vomit.  2 minutes into this show I could taste the bile and that's as far as I got.
"These are some smart, talented actors doing what they can with bad writing. Bathroom humor is not funny, it's lazy and a huge turnoff. Yuck."
"Really I couldn't.  From the very beginning the characters were not funny and were unoriginal. Also, I don't understand the need for graphic language in a comedy show.  I didn't make the show better."
"I found this show so unappealing I couldn't stand to waste my time on the whole thing--in an effort to be fair I skipped ahead to various points, but it only got worse.  Potty humor for grownups is funny? Life would have to be REALLY boring to make this interesting to me--and fortunately life isn't."
"The most amateur production quality of all of the &#34;Amazon Originals&#34; that I tried out.  I love the concept, and the title, but the show was very obviously poor, very quickly."
"Not sure why, but I didn't find this very funny or entertaining at all.  I guess the jokes weren't very clever, the plot was unoriginal, and the characters were unrealistic."
THE Writer who wrote this should go back to the bathroom and finish what he was doing. This show doesn't`deserve to be called bad.If I could spell atrocious that would be more appropriate.
"yes agree with everybody well done Terrible Picture Perfect Horror yes is a terrible horrible horror movie...cheap low budget movie, no head or feet nothing.. this guy try to speaks like Marlon Brando but is terrible terrible, terrible FX, terrible places, terrible actors, terrible dialogue..worst than SCI FI.....one of the worst movies I ever seen in my entire life...terrible terrible..."
I did not care for this movie at all. Thought it would have been much better. Subject line of this movie didn't make sense at all. Sorry I paid $6.99 to watch it.
"Pretentious. This movie tries so hard to be intense, brooding & deep but fails to deliver. No wonder it went straight to DVD. It would have bombed in general release.  Such a disappointment. Don't waste your time or money on this snooze fest."
"One beautiful shot after another...Paris, Mont Saint Michel,....plus moody music and a French woman's voice whispering &#34;poetic&#34; words.  Many, many shots of the woman spinning, prancing and dancing, with arms outstretched in all of the above sites.  We get it....she's a Free Spirit....She's French....she's adorable....she's romantic.  After a long stretch of this we see the same woman back with her stolid polar-opposite, square-jawed, decent, Oklahoma guy, a man of few words.  And he doesn't spin.  The woman's daughter, though, also frolics and spins with her arms out.  She's adorable, too, and has an adorable name, Tatiana, in case you missed the fact that she is adorable.  This goes on for quite a while.  The French woman tries to spin and dance for the guy in their house, using a scarf, but he is beginning to lose interest. She does manage to frolic and giggle when he puts the hose on her but that is short lived.  If only she could do something else...like cook or make conversation or read a book?  Her repertoire of tricks is limited to being adorable, spinning and sometimes biting....very feline and French I guess?Meanwhile Javier Bardem is a Spanish priest who is having a crisis of faith.  He is the most interesting character, so far and I had hopes that he might interject something of substance into this thin romance.  But even his presence didn't do it for me.  I was relieved when the French woman went home and the Affleck guy met a local girl.  She looked amazingly like the French one...same sweetheart face, petite body and long hair....only hers was blond.  And, thank God, she didn't spin around!  I had hopes for that duo but when she started giving her version of the same hard-luck story that the French woman delivered, I had enough.  I'll never know what happened to any of them and I'll never care."
"Only watched this because a visitor was interested in it.  Bullies at the utmost.  While they can be gentle at times only because they have you handcuffs, these people are not model citizens."
"Yay! Another show glorifying pure white trash! I'm talking about Beth, not the people they take into custody. My wife watches this crap. Shame on her."
I'm done with VH1 and these trashy classless shows. This did not make any sense at all and most of the scenes did not seem real at all. It seemed as though they were acting this time.
"it is 2013, can we have something that looks halfway decent? I turned it off within 5 minutes, not funny, didn't like the voices. Amazon you did the right thing and let us tell you these shows are terrible before sinking anymore money into them.  I usually do not like claymation, or stop-motion shows and this was no different.  In cartoon type shows, how good it looks is just as important as any character or script.  It is the first impression one has of the show and needs to be visual striking to keep peoples attention."
"Maybe this show could've had a home on Cartoon Network or wherever stoners go to watch stupid things like this, but I don't think it's worth it to pursue this show, when there are much better shows in this lineup. Please don't pick this up for series, I'd rather not have to lose faith in humanity again."
"I could only watch a few minutes of this, it was painful. It doesn't work on any level. It's clearly aimed at 9 year olds except that it contains content that's inappropriate for 4th graders. If they're intent was to do a show for children then they should clean it up so that children will be allowed to see it."
This animated sci-fi pilot waan't all that interesting to me.  I like sci-fi but only occasionally watch animated series.  I don't think I am the right demographic for this show.  This would likely appeal to young adult males.  So I don't think I'd watch any more of this.
"I really didn't like this at all. The concept was alright, and the animation was very nice, but the jokes and characters didn't hold up at all. Not interested in this as a series."
"Mind you I love Scifi, the 3 stooges, and buddy films but this came off very flat.  The verbiage and the gags did not gel together in any LOL way.  There is alot of room for improvement, but the way it is written and the voices acted, I will not invest anymore time into viewing, nor would I recommend Amazon investing $ into this story line."
Terrible show. Way to much cussing which doesn't make the movie any better. Do not watch your wasting your money.
"I was really excited for this one.  I love stop motion animation. I love high-concept comedies. I loved the opening explanation of the two different animation styles in this pilot, but I didn't like anything about this actual show.  I'm not surprised the writers are actors from Big Bang Theory; the show has a similar feel, but I hate that show.  It feels like they are trying so hard to make funny jokes, but very,very little is funny and some of it isn't even really jokes.  I'd have a hard time sitting through another episode of this."
This pilot was an animated sci-fi comedy that I struggled with watching to its conclusion.  Part of the issue was the fact that the animation was not completed but getting past that the story was thin and the characters were just not all that endearing. In a future world an egotist makes decisions in trying to eradicate rebels and is inept in his leadership.  The rebels are led by an equally inept individual.  In between are two mismatched characters who accidentally volunteer to go to a suspected rebel held planet for a reconnaissance.  There they run into a girl rebel who thinks they are also rebels (?). Of course one of these two bumblers falls for the girl immediately and then it becomes blah blah blah.  There is an attempt for subtle humor that is neither funny nor subtle.  Not something that I would want revisit.
"I usually don't mind &#34;comic-like&#34; shows, but this one was not good.  I disliked the story line/writing and it was challenging to watch the entire episode."
This show about the minions is ok but could be better I think the show would be better if it was In Animation Cartoon Animation
"The comic laziness of this episode was only paralleled  by the similarly slow advancement of the show's frames per second.  The humor was lost, lost in space as it were.  This show was just plain dull.  Just really, really incredibly dull.  The characters were dry and uninteresting, worse than a bad British sitcom.  It seemed like the creators thought that parading Star Wars tropes in front of the viewer in a comedic setting would be good enough to get us to throw money at them.  It was too forceful, overemphasized.  Like the totalitarian state that is the empire.Two thumbs down."
I found this show a little annoying with the cursing. It might be ok but I didn't feel like watching the rest of the pilot because of the language used. It was a little over used. I don't mind a few curse words but for they used it too much.
Not funny. How many puking gags can you put in one episode??? I'm guessing the target audience for this series is 9 year old kids. They *might* think it's funny. Most of these pilot episodes seem to be targeted for the under 25 crows. Older people watch TV on the web too. Please develop something for grown ups!
"All I could think of watching this is how Space Janitors (geek and sundry) was so much better, and that I didn't need a second star wars spoof in my life."
"I love sci-fi, I love comedy, and I love animation.  Combine all 3 and I'm there.  The voice acting was awesome and the comedic timing was solid.What I don't enjoy is the evil corporation trope and freedom fighter quoting Mao and actually supporting Communism.  I get it, I'm old and hating Communism is SO last century.  But, Communism is evil and it's not funny. It's especially not funny when thinly veiled as comedy and satire."
"I only made it to the 4:30 mark on this one.  Any longer and it might have done permanent brain damage.  The fat guy showed his butt ... hardy freakin' har!  There's graffiti on the spaceships ... oh, stop ... my side hurts from the hilarity.  Too dumb for adults, too filthy for the kiddies.  That leaves you with no audience dumb wits!"
"Don't like the animation style, the humor is cliche as can be, and in great abundance already on TV.  What does this add?"
"Which is to say, if you've got a lame sense of humor and don't like to watch actual good comedy, then Dark Minions is where it's at for you."
"It stunk , now that is my opinion .  I""m sure that some people who don't care about the dirty language in a cartoon would find this some what appealing .  Dark Minions is not for the heavenly hearts."
"Didn't care for the claymation aspect.  Too much unnecessary swearing, it's as if it were added just to appeal to an immature viewing audience.  Characters not interesting - bordering on annoying."
"Pitiful, juvenile attempt at satire of cable news.  There are REAL cable news networks that are funnier and more entertaining...writing is very poor and acting is worse."
"So many possibilities.  But this wasn't it.  Every single bit of this pilot was OVERTHETOP.  There were no sentences spoken - there were ""incredibly clever lines"" delivered at manic speed.  When every situation is over-played for its own well deserved hilarity (in the minds of the persons who wrote the bit), it stops being funny and becomes tedious.  That and the level of sophistication was teetering between high school and middle school.  For instance?  There is no such thing as a nano-millimeter, so the character who had one eye smaller than the other by that amount - lost the intended impact -- presumably aimed at the marketing of appearance of news anchors.  If you assume your audience is too stupid to notice, you've done your audience a disservice.  I'm more inclined to think the writers were too sloppy to check.  The whole show was like that, too 'too' to care. What a waste of all those talented actors.If possible, I won't give this thing a single star, it would only give them a false sense of accomplishment.Nope it's not possible, I had to choose at least one star.  Fine, one star for having the chutzpah to put this pilot out there."
"This was horrible right from the get go. I love the Onion news, but this just doesn't translate the same.Good luck next time."
"This show is just bad! It doesn't even make sense! I would probably never watch it again as its tacky, rude And annoying! Tried to give it a real chance and just couldn't get through the whole thing in only lasted 15 mins before I had to turn it off!!"
I dislike jokes that slander Christianity.  Showing a picture of Jesus on the cross and telling someone to get a closeup of the bulge.  If you did anything like that to any other belief system you would be characterized as a bigot and you might even be fired for it.  Not so if your bigotry is aimed at Christianity.  There is an American Pastor imprisoned in Iran who has been sentenced to 8 years in that prison because he tried to bring a message of love instead of hate to that country.  They are torturing him for that.  He will probably die in that prison at the hands of his torturers.  There are reports that he is bleeding internally from constant beatings but the Iranians wont get him a doctor.  So whoever wrote this crap that is supposed to be funny is a Christian bigot. I'm sure your very proud of yourself.
"This show is only funny if you are satisfied with witless, trite humor.  I watched it because, with such a good rating, it was bound to be entertaining.  I consider it a waste of my time.  The writers really went for the low hanging fruit.  Truly a letdown.  If this is the caliber of humor we might expect from this show, I hope Amazon won't pursue it."
"The writing was full of puns that were intended to be funny, but it just came off as corny--very unpleasant to watch. I tried to force myself to watch an entire episode, but I couldn't make it beyond about 15 minutes. I realized that it hadn't gotten better by then so chances are that it wasn't going to happen by the end."
There was nothing 'biting' or 'sharp' about this. It was so boring I hit the back arrow so I could write this review before I forgot I'd watched the thing.
"This show is horrible.  I love satire, but the writers here seem to think that satire is the same as intentionally offensive.  I would say the jokes are bad, but I don't see them as jokes.  You also can't call it childish because of the graphic language, which does nothing to make the show better.  Bad acting, bad writing, bad behavior, bad show."
"Couldn't get past the big twine ball kill. Really? I love satire, but I like it to be subtle and intelligent. I like it to fulfill the purpose of legitimate comment upon the ironies of life. This was just dumb and uninteresting--a few good one-liners, but they weren't enough to sustain life among the flotsam of over-the-top stupidity."
"The people who produced this had an opportunity to make an intelligent, adult satire/comedy. If this is the best they can do it's time they all made a career change. This is stuff class clowns come up with in high school.  I'm surprised this junk made it this far."
"Poorly written, terribly acted. Only Jon Daly's character is remotely amusing but the cringe-worthy &#34;nerd&#34; dialogue written by someone who clearly gets all their nerd info from the internet in 2010 and Big Bang Theory reruns completely overshadows that one bright spot. Terrible."
"I just didn't think it was very funny. The writing wasn't bad, just some of the acting left something to be desired."
"I like the concept but the show is filled with totally unlikable characters. The humor is all based on uncomfortably weird characters... there can definitely be quirky, likable characters in a show but these aren't them. I understand this is supposed to be a comedy for ""mature"" audiences but there are plenty of mature individuals who get tired of F-bomb laced dialogue."
"This show is insulting to anyone who knows more than 5 words about computer science and pop culture. I wanted to like it, the premise was interesting, the characters were tolerable, but the writing was bludgeoning. The stuff they say is so poorly written I couldn't get further than half way through the second episode. It's so glaringly obvious that the writers have no freaking idea what lingo people in the industry use or care to do 30 seconds of research to check. I lost it and gave up on the show when one of the 'tech savvy' girl characters wants to start taking bets and while holding a piece of yellow coin shaped plastic says 'I got a BitCoin on Bollywood'. BitCoins are not actual coins, for anyone wondering, and if you spend more than 3 hours on the internet you would know that. This show is somehow more of an insult to nerd culture than Big Bang Theory."
"Suckage, and deserving of no more commentary.  If you have no life, this might interest you a little bit. But even then, not so much."
"but I just couldn't. I tried but the winey predictable characters didn't supply me with anything new. Been here, done this before. Get better story lines & maybe I'll come back."
"Why was this given 5 stars? It's not funny, it may be smart but so what. Not worth it but I am guessing it will get picked for some odd reason!"
"Since the first few episodes were offered free on streaming media, I wanted to sample this new show.  In summary,I thought the plot was boring and stupid.  I did not even finish the first episode."
If I could I would have given it zero stars. It was painful to watch - I saw no clever dialogue.
"I am too old and too un-cool to understand anything these techno-boobs were mumbling about in their hyper-tech-babble.They were all drinking Monster, double espressos or using Methamphetamines in some form and then yammering about everything in THEIR world (which is not my world hence NO frame of reference was found). I didn't give a tinker's dam about any of them or their insipid, vapid, banal and jujune lives."
"What a steaming pile of puerile pandering, I haven't seen a show this bad in years; between the childish writing and mediocre acting I'm amazed that this made it into production at all."
I was bored throw this whole show. I watched the first episode and found myself constantly getting up and wandering around out of boredom with the show.
"that workers show on Comedy Central, the Rain in Philadelphia show, all stuff that I watched once and would rather throw my TV out the window than watch again.  This is the same exact show with a different title."
"It's rare for me to turn off a program before it concludes, but I couldn't make it through the very disappointing pilot. The premise is clever, but the execution is definitely not targeted to my demographic. I want to believe that no self-respecting audience would watch a bunch of supposedly clever adults drop F-bombs in every other sentence."
"A show about the lives of not at all likeable people making an app (who cares?), speaking in internet shorthand, to other equally unappealing characters, all in a manor that is trying to prove how &#34;now&#34; and &#34;college educated&#34; it is.  Truly cool people don't try to be cool, they just are.  Truly good shows don't try to prove anything to you, they just tell their stories, and this show is just trying soooo hard.  No thanks."
"I don't think so. Kind of a wreckless show that portrays programmers as a bunch of aspie, half-wits whose success is all a gamble based on some dude backing the project. Nope. Not realistic at all. Truly successful projects mentioned in the show didn't need a huge amount of capital to get off the ground. I think its a sloppy concept."
"Huge disappointment.  A good pilot has a difficult but straightforward job; establish the characters, let us know what their goals are, set a weekly plot in motion.  Alpha House does none of this to any satisfactory degree.  I still don't know why on earth these guys need to live together.  John Goodman completely fails to register with his one note cornpone drawl.  And he looks bored.  He's better than this.What passes for satire is pitiful and obvious; this is sub-Entourage writing and execution (maybe that's what they are going for?).  Just awful.  I confess I actually watched this TWICE; I was so confused about how it could be so bad when it sounded so promising that I wondered if I missed something.  I didn't.  This is a lesson on how not to do a TV pilot.ONE good joke: dish of flag pins."
"I couldn't finish.  The premise made me believe it would be right up my alley, but this show wasn't even mildly amusing.  If you're looking for a similarly minded comedy that's actually watchable, HBO's ""Veep"" would be my recommendation.It will take a miracle to get me to watch another ""Amazon Original."""
I so wanted this to be good. This was not crazy enough to be satire and well just stupid. I love to look at Mark Consuelos. John Goodman is a dear.But this was an insult to latinos and southern white men. the lowest common denominator would have been funnier . I want the 30 minutes back. The clip at the end deserved a chuckle but even Corbet could not make this show deserve a laugh out loud. It could be so much better sharper more intelligent but it just is not.  It is obvious in it's  attempts of humor stereotypical and well watch a jon stewart or even Glen Beck another time for some laughs not this farse. Sorry Garry Trudeau you did not hit the nail close to the head.
"The best part of this was Bill Murray's cameo. Too bad he's not actually in the show, he might have saved it from being a predictable snoozer.Sorry John Goodman, you were only funny as Dan Connor. Where is that accent supposed to be from?The black guy is funny. And the little bald guy kinda is, except the gay thing is tired. I don't like Live With Kelly's soap opera husband in this.Pass."
"When I heard about this concept of voting on pilots, I immediately sent an email out to all of my friends. Today I finally got around to watching alpha house, wow I could not believe how poorly written it is. Felt like a first draft not a fleshed out script. Had hoped for something more advanced and creative from this team. Amazon was correct on its approach. I hope that its equally as smart in how to invest its money. Alpha House ""ain't it."" Grade F"
Great actors but script was weak as well as direction. Too cheesy and flat....Slow pace....Too much filler...Good camera work...Do not recommend
"Trite. Unfunny. Predictable. Unintelligent. Partisan.This is a show that had a lot of promise. You begin with Bill Murray in the opening sequence. You have John Goodman. Some other decent actors. The premise is comical right off the bat-- a handful of politicians sharing a house in Washington.But the writing is so awful, I can't imagine watching another moment of this program. Maybe I'm jaded, as someone who works in politics, but the scenarios and dialogue just weren't believable (think ""All the President's Men"" or ""The Ides of March"" or even the original ""The Manchurian Candidate""), nor were they quite farcical enough to be recognizable as some sort of absurdist lampoon (think ""Airplane"" or ""Naked Gun"" or even ""Thank You For Smoking""). This show is an attempted political comedy that takes itself and its ideological/partisan mission way too seriously. Political humor can be great, but, whether it's on the right or left, it usually falls flat when it's a vehicle for driving an underlying partisan agenda first and foremost. Good political comedy should be equal-opportunity offensive to both sides, or rather, to the system itself.SNL's Weekend Update, The Daily Show, and its successors are at their funniest and most relevant when they first lay bare the truth about the butt of their joke fairly and in context, giving the subject of ridicule a chance to legitimately make his or her case, and THEN and only then mock the stupidity/bigotry/misguidedness relentlessly. Alpha House doesn't give Republican viewpoints a fair hearing, nor does it add anything new to the world of political satire/parody. It just rehashes a bunch of junk that wasn't funny the first hundred times it was done, and more importantly, it's a chance to score partisan points primarily, and a vehicle for comedy only secondarily.That's what this felt like, at least, watching the pilot. A vehicle for Garry Trudeau's hyper-cynical, humorless, out-of-touch, leftist political agenda.Step one- Start by creating one-dimensional characters from the lamest and most overdone Republican stereotypes imaginable.Step two- Throw in some of the left's contemporary pet political issues. Social issues and global warming.Step three- Create weak ""straw man"" arguments from the Republican characters to discredit the conservative side of these issues.Step four- Now try to make that mess funny.Get Garry Trudeau out of this project, and with the cast and concept, it's probably a big hit. The next House of Cards, perhaps. Right now, though, no way does this catch on. Nor should it. Which is too bad, because John Goodman in particular does a fine job in his role, despite abysmal writing."
"This show is insipid, humorless, ridiculous and a total failure. Do not waste your time. Repeat..DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME"
"As a long time Amazon customer I had high hopes for these Originals. I am severely disappointed to find them full of profane language and sophomoric behavior. After 3 minutes of Alpah House I stopped. I don't care how clever the concept is or how well known the actors. If this level of ""humor"" is any reflection on the working culture at Amazon.com I will really have to reconsider doing business with you. I have not watched any more, since they all start with the same ""mature audience"" warning. Come on! The content of these productions, if Alpha House is anything to go by, is anything BUT ""mature"". I do not object to occasional strong language in appropriate context, or as a character device, but this is way over the line. What makes you think this is funny?"
"Bill Murray was the only thing funny in this..and he's not even going to be on the show.. John Goodman hasn't done anything worth watching since his turn in the Big Lebowski (15 years ago). The last thing I want to watch is a biased GOP comedy.. I think it's supposed to be a parody, though I can't really tell, it's not funny.. There's nothing funny about a bunch of ignorant self centered racist homophobes.. Turns my stomach,  because most of these people belong in jail, not glorified in a sitcom..if you can call it that.. If I wanna watch conservative shows, I'll tune into FX for their jab one liners..Oh wait, that's right, I don't... and I won't be watching this show either.."
"We couldn't even get through episode one. The writing is dreadful: he should stick with comic strips. The characters are amazingly non-funny, and the worst part is that they are all excellent actors. What a waste of time."
"This could be on HBO, why because HBO is an upon supporter to the democrat party. This is nothing more than a non stop hit piece on republicans and a cursory review of the reviews for this show will reveal who this show caters to."
"If you hate the gop & any thoughts that are not left of center..this is your show. Don't we get enough of that on abc, nbc and cbs? Disappointing Amazon. Love you guys...this is beneath you."
Overall good cast. the writing is third rate. vulgar language in place of wit. the idea is a good one............change the writing staff.
"Yeah, I said it.  Alpha House teases us with a very quick appearance of Bill Murray which gives hope for this series, but it doesn't look like we will see him much due to his character's predicament.  There are too many characters that are too witty, too immature, too drunk, too irresponsible, too over-the-top in every respect.  Who writes this stuff?"
"Well, it's no 'House of Cards'---I think it's great amazon.com is branching out, but this show is soooo boring and unattractive...and full of old ugly men and stereotypes....Hello--'Doomberry' crawl out of your ivory towers, the American people have known for sometime that there is no two party system it's all one big oligarchy corporatist statist new world order. But sooo glad to be reminded of the paradigm; Republi-cate BAD, Demo-ican GOOD, soooo original---Thanks 'Doomberry', I forgot for a moment we are suppose to have a two party system, and most importantly that there was a difference-wow soooooo enlightening.....not. I'd rather watch the Dr RonPaul Channel or 'BreakingBad' or 'GoT' for the nineth time then this dated crap.  Anyway, Keep trying amazon, I think overall you have a better selection than Netflix; can't wait til GoT season 4 is available."
"Gary Trudeau has taken every leftist cliche to form the characters and dialogue in this pilot.  Unfunny, unimaginative, sophomoric---a lot like his career over the past decade or so."
"Yes, it has a cameo in the beginning and John Goodman, but that's only good for 5 minutes.  A comedy in politics isn't exciting.  They try to liven it up with swearing (nothing wrong with that, but seems it's there just to make you feel it's not network tv) and attempts at wtf moments."
Just Hollywood 's way of caricaturing the way that think other people think. It becomes clear they think all Republicans are hypocrites and Idiots. But not the people they pick to be in the White House.
Poorly written. Yet another show about political dolts in DC? No thanks. How about some sort of setup so we understand that congresspeople actually live together while their families stay back in their home states?
"Too much unnecessary bad language - overacting ,bad casting  story line far fetched - just did not connect - sad I had higher expectations"
"The story content is enough to be sickened if we are to believe this is Washington D. C. Expecting to see a story about the inside of our capital, it was totally to be shut off I the middle of it. Enuf is enuf."
Stupid story line and stupid dialing what the heck would get this to the public? How desperate to fill air space!
"Couldn't even make it half way through the pilot.  Didn't laugh once.  Matter of fact, didn't feel anything for this show.  It's as boring as staring at a wall.  The main characters are unlikeable and the dialogue sounds forced.Not sure who's approving the shows for Amazon but the two that I have watched so far (Alpha House and The After) have both been terrible."
"This show is terrible. Half of the nation votes Republican yet, Amazon comes out with a show that plays to the liberal talking points - just like all other Hollywood(Hollyweird) political shows do. This particular episode was over the top in this regard where the conservative character says things that are not really conservative. They are things that liberals think are conservative or things that liberals wish conservatives believed in. I like the show's characters, but I hate the politics of this show. If this keeps up, I am dropping the show from my watch list. My advice to Amazon: create a liberal-bashing show which would be a hit since there is NOTHING like that out there in the mainstream entertainment media. Or they could create a show that bashes both parties equally - that would also still be new and appeal to both political viewpoints."
"This show seemed like it had a lot of potential, but really fell short of my expectations. I thought Garry Tradeau might be able to put together a good story, but clearly his limits are confined to comic strips. The best part about the pilot was the Bill Murray cameo. Unfortunately, it doesn't sound like he will be a recurring character. The humor really fell flat, and seemed forced at times. Knowing Tradeau's comic strip, I was expecting him to take partisan shots at the GOP. It is really unoriginal, and an expected par for the course. It would have been interesting for him to think outside the box of his own political views, but that would require a much sharper mind. Also, Senators do not live like that in DC. Representatives will often times sleep in their offices in DC, but I have certainly never heard of a Senator rooming with three others. There is a serious lack of beltway and political knowledge on display in this show. Maybe ""Veep"" has set the bar too high for political comedies. I am a DC resident and political junkie, which is partly why I had hoped this would be a new show to watch. Nice try. Next."
If you want to watch a good show about the political scene in Wasington D.C. watch house of cards. This show is just a rip off House of cards on Netfix.  I'll keep watching house of cards this show was not worth watching
"Not worthy of Trudeau. Not his medium, apparently. Worse than juvenile, but that's the best I could say about it. Crude, idiotic, total waste of time and mind."
"The actors are trying too hard to be funny and they are not.  The only funny part was Colbert at the end.  I do enjoy liberal bashing, but these may not be the right actors to handle it."
"No class, utter waste of time."
"I really wanted to like this but even with John Goodman and Bill Murray you ruined it. There was no balance and it was so slanted and bigoted against anyone with conservative or a republican viewpoint that I couldn't finish watching it.  The writing is indicative of a person who has a personal hatred of anyone on the right. If the underlying story had told the truth and there had been anything truly funny, it could have been good."
Don't waste your time.  It is not funny.  All the jokes are political.  The script is clearly written about one political party by the other.
Did not enjoy this one. We just finished West Wing and thought this would be just as enjoyable but couldn't stand to watch more than three episodes.
"Update: I have to laugh at the people who found this review ""not helpful."" They think everyone has to agree with them.  Still don't want Hollywood imposing their political views on everyone.If this show took on both political parties I might have watched more than 15 minutes of it. I don't want politics in the shows I watch."
"It tries to be funny, but is just irritating in its overuse of profanity and cliche. I would have expected better from this writer."
"A series about 4 US Senators living together like 50 something frat boys.  Sloppy, spoiled, bored and boring.  Trashy, trite dialog which would run half as long if the writers had to exclude the &#34;F&#34; word.  I found the characters totally unlikeable and found nothing humorous in this &#34;comedy.&#34;  We couldn't even make it through the entire episode and stopped it after 15 minutes."
"not very funny, characters and situations seem implausible. If it bears any true relationship to today's elected officals, we are indeed in trouble."
"Garry Trudeau has to feel pretty good about himself.  Republicans and Tea Partiers are portrayed as hypocritical fools and shills.  This will play well with half the country and not the other half.  Sadly for me, I'm in that other half and have better things to do than get sucker-punched by my entertainment."
"It may be true how some of our representatives act in Washington; however, I don't think that it needs to be thrown in our face.  I honestly believe there are many of our representatives that attempt to do a good day's work without all the bad language and disgusting habits.  If this is Hollywood's way of depicting Washington, I want nothing of it.  These writers need to go back to their muses and begin again, i.e. Mr. Smith goes to Washington.  Don't give our bad side a voice."
Maybe it's just me but it seems these type of shows are mirror images of each other. Alpha House just isn't that funny.
"I didn't finish watching this episode. I barely started watching it, and it was just the second episode I was trying to watch. Something distracted me from it."
I am sure that I would have enjoyed this series but did not get through the first episode before switching off due to the awful language.  Surely these men could be expected to have a larger vocabulary.  All in all I was very disappointed and would not recommend anyone to watch the series.
"No doubt somebody somewhere finds it funny to watch adolescents disguised as adults cuss and whine about... well, sex, mostly. I'm not one of them. The actors are my age. Most people my age don't find this stuff amusing. Well, not the ones I hang out with, anyway. Certainly not the ones who are concerned with matters that ought to be of concern to elected representatives."
"I don't get why they can't make these Amazon shows better.  Every single one I've watched has been full of swearing... I'm no prude and don't mind swearing too much, but there is no room for that in these shows.  And yet, each time (and this time is no exception) in the first two minutes, there are too many swear words to count. It completely ruined what ought to have been a good show.  Thumbs down, and NO MORE Amazon shows for me."
Very &#34;frat house&#34;. Could be &#34;Animal House&#34; for the middle aged. Didn't really like it. Not for every audience for sure.
"John Goodman sold out to the right wing nuts for this series.  How could they expect anyone other than the Republican, extreme right to tune in to a weekly series?  They might as well have had Rush Limbaugh in the cast.  Put this on FOX TV.  Why try to politicize a series which is so obviously one-sided.  Bring back West Wing and trash this one."
I found that it was a very depressing story with no real message or meaning. Hated it. Will not even try to watch any other movies by this director.
"Not reviews or word of mouth,( got me interested in this show), just 'Hey, why not?&#34;20 minutes of 'EEEuuuuu!'. Not funny, not much of anything, except recycled and poorly conceived garbage.Amy Schumer is not funny: she 'dumpster dives' for ideas, and only comes up with worn down fragments of other much better comedians routines, and not even the best of them.Unoriginal trash spouted by a person with a drive for fame infinitely greater than her talent, creativity, or intelligence.  Avoid like the plague!"
not my cup of tea.....nothing really more to say about it ..some will like it some wont..l just try and then delete if you dont like it
Trust me 30 seconds is more than this is worth.Don't bother watching this.it's garbage and filthy and a sad commentary on our society
"Just to raw and dirty for me.  Maybe it's a young person thing but I would rather go have my teeth clean than watch another episode, one was more than enough. At some point in your life you find that septic tank humor fails to shock or make you laugh."
"You would think with all the big names that we would have and acting, directing, story writing tour de force. Wrong!! Disappointed to say it was the same old spirit storyline with just a few corny same old ghost special effects. Acting was as robotic as the effects were corny. After two weeks there is little to remember and in two more weeks nothing will be remembered. Sad day for Fanning (or good if you like money)."
"Had Val Kilmer NOT been  in ths movie! I would have given it four stars...Quite some time ago, Val Kilmer was a moderately talented actor. What he lacked in talent, he made up for with being moderately handsome and appealing. But this movie clearly demonstrates how very long ago that was.  Looking bloated and disturbingly older than his actual years, Kilmer sleepwalks through every scene. This is even more evident in the scenes  he shares with the gifted actor Bruce Dern.  Dern is still able to add depth and conviction to his role. Dern is everything Kilmer will never hope to be...The supporting cast is exceptional -especially Elle Fanning.This movie also has some visually stunning scenes. The use of color is incredible.With so many good things going for it, I still cannot recommend this movie - because of how disturbingly BAD Val kilmer is."
"I am writing this review while watching the movie, so I guess it says a lot about it. With the people involved in making this movie, this is such a disappointment.The style was directly copied from the director of Sin City & 300. , but the story line and the actors don't manage to carry out such a tricky atmosphere. I am not even sure there is any story line per se, which probably does not help. The actors don't seem convinced either, which probably explains why they are not convincing.If it comes for free, give it a try and fast forward if necessary. I regret paying for this rental."
Is this really all that Coppola can do anymore?  This is hardly a story and it wastes Elle Fanning completely.  Something about a writer and the ghost of Poe and a haunting.  You can barely follow it and it is dull as well.
"This series has no action and mostly consists of the characters being immature retards. This show is not funny, the animation is terrible, The writing is horrible and the showitself is just horrible. I would not recommend you waste your money on this horrible tv show."
"stream quality was poor and pixelated.  Show paused and froze many times, also requiring me to make a hard restart of my system just to get system working again.  Not sure why, but for now we are staying away from some of these, as much as we like them but they are freezing my Wii completely making it unresponsive."
"Update. Nope, I tried again to view an entire episode further into the season and just couldn't do it. As the show title states: she's an addict and she needs help. Addiction of any kind is not healthy for family life.This is not a ""How To"" series designed to instruct anything other than time-consuming and money-sucking an addiction is. Well, I guess it could be useful, if you don't think of it as a show about house projects proper.This show, along with the many other shows from the diynetwork are contrived and set-up. Sadly, that network started with good intentions, but fell victim wanting to produce commercially viable fodder rather than to truly provide actual helpful information.  It's contrived; staged, drama, awkward.To start, the show is only 23 minutes long and there are recaps of recaps of recaps before AND after the edited/removed commercial breaks which cuts down on actual ""show"". The editing is incredibly erratic. In the first episode, there's an inspection of work that hasn't been discussed yet, let alone shown in progress until you watch the second episode and then it's glossed over. It's unrealistic timewise. She states specific times, but according to the weather and the state of the landscaping it sure ain't the three weeks she's whining about.  I'm guessing she got this gig because she's petite and blonde.As a single mom, who is a real estate agent as well as house flipper who *supposedly* does the majority of the work on the houses AND is the subject of a TV series, I wonder how she finds time to parent her child.It pains me to write this because I am such a huge freak fan of DIY shows and was doing the Snoopy Happy Dance delighted to FINALLY see one of these shows on AmazonPrime (not even Netflix shows them)!  I was all settled down to have my marathon DIY fest and then reality set in as I watched the first episode.  I then gagged through the second episode and part of the third one give it a fair shake, but just couldn't go any further.Please Amazon, bring us some USEFUL DIY shows (NOT from diynetwork - those shows are produced only for ratings, NOT for imparting real, honest and useful information.  We want to see shows like:  This Old House, Ask This Old House, Hometime, - basically anything from PBS!!!Thank you."
"This was bundled in (at no charge) with the newest season premiere of Burn Notice so I watched about 20 minutes of it before throwing in the towel.Bored out of my mind; acting is from hunger (if one can even call it acting); story is totally unbelievable and flat, and the writing is about the same: dreadful.With so much quality programming available, there is no way I would spend time finishing the pilot or watching any episodes in the future.Saddest thing is the creator, Jeff Eastin, is right on with White Collar (which I love).  Graceland just doesn't do a thing for me (except for the cute guys), but even an old lonely gay man like me needs more than young cute guys to be a loyal fan of a program!"
"I saw a preview of this and decided to FIOS it for my mom, step father and I.  It started out so good.  But as it went in, it got worse and worse.  First, the characters play so many different people, that it is hard to follow what it the hell person they are playing.  Second, not just the characters they play, but there are way to many people going back and forth in this show.  I have not a clue as to who anyone is.  Next, they have been dragging the same thing on and on and on.  Unless these people are the stupidest people, they would know who the bad guy really was.  Another problem is that I can never understand what two of the actors are saying.  They mumble.  I am always like, what the he k did they say?  My mom and I do not really like it.  We watch because my step father likes it.  I found out it has been renewed for a second season.  Now I will have to watch more of this show.  I hope the next season gets better.  As I said, it started out really good."
total disappointment . we were hard core fans and we can't figure out what happened with the writing. the turned Fiona and Madelin into whiny simply tear annoying women.  those were my favorite characters before.
"If you want to watch a lameflick ?? Here you go !!! Aftershock is a disaster movie that tries to be like hostel that tries to be touristas. This movie absolutely rediculous !!! Poor acting , horrible plot , incoherent story line . I'm even appalled by how lame  Eli Roths character was in this movie and how he was part in the writing of this ultimate piece of garbage . He needs to focus on making ... Clown ... Now that looks great and creepy. Better luck next time Eli ."
I put this movie on to see all the beautiful scenery and all I got was a chance to see more people talking about nothing. If I had wanted to hear people talking about nothing I could have tuned to most sitcoms that come on these days.
Apparently everyone involved with making of this film also rated it.  Very sad and transparent effort. Waste of my time.
really bad mash up of every bad genre stereotype and cliche put in a bland story that has no spark whatsoever.
"This sorry excuse for a movie is pure amateur hour. Bad writing, inept acting, silly special effects and it makes no sense at all - but who cares? Apparent they just slapped some scenes together and called it a day. Don't waste your time."
"One bad boring movie...with the regular scare tatics ...but with some uniteresting boring acting, boring script and a wasteof your quality time...you have been warned.....don't waste your time on inferior products..."
The movie overall was disappointing. Just the way that it was portrayed then how it played out was not at all good. It was ok.
"No spoiler alert only because this movie makes absolutely no sense & what's worse, the acting (not actors) or their dialogue is hidious.  I'm in to the movie about 20 minutes and I'm regretting my selection and considering ending the (my) torture but no, I continue to watch hoping against all hope that it will improve but it doesn't.  In fact, it continues the descent into what I've only seen a handful of times in my life - oh the agony, the utter and complete pain.  Let this review be your WARNING: Go to your next selection - don't waste your time here.  The story sucks, the acting sucks worse and the ghosts are absurd, horrible.  Please whoever you are please don't ever try to make a movie again."
"Well, that was twenty minutes of my life I'll never get back. I do thank the other reviewers that watched to the end. You gave me enough information that I KNEW I could dump out at twenty minutes and not feel bad. That was terrible and this was free for Amazon Prime customers.The acting is awful. The script? Terrible.  There are no scares here. There is no story and there is nothing to keep you interested.  Read the long reviews and believe.  This is terrible.  Heck, it's not even worth watching for FREE."
"This is unbelievably bad - even if you get it free, it is not worth wasting your time. I don't need to go into specifics, I think that's been covered in previous reviews. I can't believe something this awful was even made."
"This is the latest offering of another remake of Japanese horror films, a genre that was short-lived because of its repetitive scenarios (young women haunted, pursued and assaulted by malefic entities) that led audiences to anticipate and predict the stories. This movie, released in 3D (why?) is a bad remake of the Japanese film by the same title, directed by Ataru Oikawa from a script by himself, Takamasa Sato and Kei Oishi, which was adapted from the latter's novel ""Ju-On"". The Japanese version, far superior to this rendition, is itself heavily influenced by (if not plagiarized from) ""Dark Waters"", ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"".""Apartment 1303 3D"" is directed and produced by Michael Taverna, who also wrote the script, that has such memorable lines as """"Ugh, this apartment's freaking me out!"" and ""Apartments don't kill people. People kill people.""The story happens in modern day Detroit, where a naive young woman (Janet) rents an affordable apartment with a dazzling panoramic view, in an old building. Janet (Julianne Michelle) is trying to assert her independence from her domineering, abusive alcoholic mother (Rebecca DeMornay) and moves out of the family home, which she also shared with older sister Lara (Misha Barton).Weird people inhabit the building and the apartment is haunted by an angry ghost that eventually murders Janet, faking a suicide. Lara and her married cop boyfriend Mark (Cory Sevier), investigate the circumstances of Janet's death. No spoilers here.The story is hackneyed, lacks escalating suspense and is packed with inconsistencies; many questions are left unanswered, leading the viewer not to care about any of the two-dimensional characters populating this fog. The direction is inept, the staging unimaginative and the acting is mostly clumsy. The special effects are incomplete and the few chills rely mainly on ambiguous frenzied violence and sound blasts.The ill conceived nod to Hitchcock's `Psycho' of a malevolent mother entity and a grisly shower scene; along with the strange inhabitants, ghostly apparitions, summoning voices, creepy noises and an ominous soundtrack cannot save this vapid, dull, droning concoction of clich&eacute;s. It would have fared better with a funnier dialogue, as a parody or clever spoof, lampooning bad horror movies.Fans of real-estate thriller/chillers should look-up ""The Shining"", ""The Tenant"", ""The Fourth Floor"", ""1408"" or ""The Conjuring"" and give this turkey a wide berth."
"Good actors, poor acting. It was just kind of dumb. Never figured out why certain people did what they did, why the ghost was angry... just not very good."
"absolutely pointless. filled with images and events you've seen before, many times. not an original idea in sight. can't stand actors who emote by yelling."
This show seemed like something that would be right up my alley....it just falls flat in my opinion. I've already removed from my watchlist.
"Once I read a commentary saying that any movie with Mickey Rourke in it wasa guaranteed bad movie.  Then he dropped out of sight for years, and thenre-emerged with &#34;The Wrestler&#34;, a good movie.  Then this came out and I thoughtI'd give it a try.  The &#34;good guy&#34; in this film is played by Kellan Lutz (a youngerbeefcake actor) supposedly a Marine still grieving for the death of his olderbrother who he followed into the service.  Somehow he ends up in Java Indonesia,trying to help a local detective (played by a well-known Indonesian actor namedArio Baku) to figure out the abduction of a princess and then, to save his familywho are kidnapped by the ridiculous bad-guy played by Rourke.Of all the problems with the movie the bad-guy character is the most problematic.What the heck accent is that supposed to be?  How come he can kill local peoplecasually when he has no visible bodyguards around him?  And generally, do peoplereally run around the streets there firing automatic weapons and nobody else stopspartying?Do yourself a favor--skip this one."
"Spoiler alert - Kellen Lutz is acting. Well, trying to act. You can tell because he has dyed his hair black. This is a signal to us to take him seriously.  You know a movie is bad when all you can really remember is how dreadfully bad a ""flat black shoe polish"" dye job was. Lutz is so bad, so painfully bad, you feel sorry for the guy.Another very disturbing component of this movie is Micky Roarke.Mickey Roarke continues to coast along on past glory. His ""cat woman"" plastic surgery is so disturbingly unnatural that you can never fully concentrate on his character. I kept wondering if he was still alive, or just a very badly made wax figure.Don't waste your time on this movie. If the actors and production crew didn't take it seriously, then neither should you."
This cooking show is cattle call style like the &#34;idol&#34; type shows.  So tired of weird people and weird ingredients.  Once again I appreciate the cooks on pbs (bless you Julia wherever you are) who actually taught us something about food and cooking.
"Someone told us about this show.  Right away it seemed fake to me.  The fake beard on the main scientist, the perfectly manicured women scientists, the stupid reenactments, I was not believing it for one second, my husband on the other hand was very much fooled by it until they showed the ""actual footage"" of the mermaid on the beach growling at the boys.  Hello people, that is computer animation if I ever saw it.  I am amazed by some of the reviews on here with people thinking that was real at all.  The acting was not very good at all and the casting was even worst.  I hate that I paid $4 for this thing, do not waste your money and read the reviews before you put your money down."
I was hoping for a scientific treatment of the theory but this is completely fake and a waste of money: http://www.snopes.com/photos/supernatural/mermaids.asp
"For longtime fans of American Pickers, this season was a real let-down: ridiculously short, boring, uninspired. As the song said, is this all there is?"
Hammers every suspect as if they're guilty. Does he ever go back and apologize to all of the people he insulted who were innocent?Perfect example of cops and why we all hate them.
"Really, really annoyed that after watching 4 seasons the finale ends with a cliffhanger never to be resolved.  The whole season had been building up to this ending and then it was unresolved.  Very frustrating and disheartening."
"A great disappointment, the characters were uninteresting and the shows basically cheap duplications of the original show Primeval which ran on BBC. I cannot in good conscious recommend this show to any one, mercifully it's run was short."
"This movie is not well done, completely predictable and totally fails to make the viewer care what will happen next."
what the hell is wrong with film mkaersan adventure film should not be mindlessand just insaneas this plot isand get some big strong guys not tiny midget with no muscles for fighting jeeeeesh
"OK, so I am interested enough to buy this series, season 3, and today expecting to the latest episode in my email, I get this behind the scenes ""crap"" ... that is, not a real episode, and Amazon charged me $2 for it on top of that.  All the other behind the scenes stuff has been totally free ... not that I watch it ... I really do not care for that stuff.So, is this an Amazon mistake or what ... there seem to be a lot more mistakes lately.DAMMIT Amazon ... I just got another Behind the Scenes video with another charge ... where is the damn episode for this week.Start paying your interns or something or get rid of the incompetent management, please.UPDATE - created an Amazon Customer Service Request and asked to be refunded for what can only be a mistake here."
Don't ever get a season pass from Amazon unless you want to get ripped off. I chose the season pass option to get the episodes as soon as they came out then at the end of the season they charge me for behind the scenes 2 minute clips! Customers should only be charge for real episodes. Never again will I get a season pass!
"If this could be any more boring it would be a blank screen. I feel asleep, twice trying to watch the first episode. Same old formula that has been used in TV SCI-FI since the 1970s. The acting is very shallow, the story makes little sense and the whole thing moves so slow I prayed it would end.Funny concepts like aliens not being able to detect the humans in small groups who are just a block away from the landing site in a makeshift fortress is too absurd for me. How bout aliens can't detect you if you didn't wash your feet because the cheesy odor blocks your natural human scent.The writer, Rodat, was really reaching. The whole show is TV's Latest Epic Fail."
This is cool as a side story but boba fett isn't nearly as awsome in this as he is in the movie. The battle with the radio active penguin from mars was pretty sweet though.
"Seriously? Isn't one show about stupid, spoiled, rich women enough? We have to keep spinning this off in different cities, and for multiple seasons? I tried watching 5 minutes of this dreck and have come to the conclusion that I hate Teresa Giudice with a passion (even more so than I hate all the other women on all the shows) Why do these shows keep getting multiplied and renewed? Isn't ONE group of spoiled, stupid housewives enough?"
I really liked Keeping up with the Kardashians about 6 seasons ago.  The plot is never changing and it's always such super high drama for a bunch of rich people.  This season is disappointing and not worth the money.
"These people MUST be legally retarded! Kim, being pregnant and too stupid to realize it's healthy for her and the baby if she gains weight. WHO would NEED to be told that? And then, to see her waddle around in those sky high heels and wonder why her feet are so swollen. She is an IDIOT!!!! She went on Jay Leno and said how the baby hardly ever cries. Well, if the baby is as STUPID as her mother, she probably hadn't figured out HOW! I also don't understand Kim's fascination with the UGLIEST black men she can find. I know there are attractive black men, but, wow... she just can't manage to find them! Bruce Jenner must've left all his sense on the Olympic playing field back in the 70s, that'd be the only way he'd be able to stand this stable of chattering morons!!!"
"I'm really lost on how anyone rated this more than 1 star! I really wanted to like this movie but every decision these two ""survivers"" made was illogical given the situation they were in.I sat here watching these two guys brushing their teeth for 3 minutes- then I asked myself ""wtf am I watching and why?""zombies that are so slow and weak that these two feel trapped in a car for days? he actually walked a zombie into the house to scare his friend- yet they are still trapped in a car for days? why didn't the zombies go after the guy who crawled through the sunroof and leave the car alone?the whole world is gone and these two guys only want to eat canned tuna, hit rocks into the ocean, toss a baseball and fish?a billion pairs of headphones that can be found at any store on the block and they fight over the one pair they have?every house for their taking and they live in the woods? every gun to be had and they chose a 6 shot revolver? they could take any big 4x4 truck or motor home they wanted and they chose a tiny volvo wagon? they could've traveled by atv or motorcycle but walk instead? they could've lived on a yacht 50' off shore where it was safe- but they still lived in the woods? and why were they spared the virus?neither thought of maybe finding a female to procreate with to carry on the human race? they talk about eating dogs and living off tuna but then walk by a field full of cows?neither wanted to even build a solid safe house so they could relax without fear? plus the most boring, drawn out (pull my hair out and scream) ending in the history of movies, ever! posters are commenting on the ""reality"" of the movie.... NOTHING IS REALISTIC!!!The entire premise and plot was about surviving, yet neither did anything that any rational person would've done to survive! there was no climax (except for when he was masturbating to a female zombie in the car!) gawd- this movie was so bad!this movie is just so so so DUMB!I'm sorry- but it just really felt like the director tried too hard to not make this a typical zombie film and failed."
It was constantly buffering and took forever to load.  So disappointing.  You have a lot of good HBO shows available now but there are so many issues with the buffering.
"complete waste of time at least for me, absolutely no high drama here!!! after 5 minutes I had to turn to something else!!!"
"I hated the first one, which was one of the most boring and derivative horror movies I have ever seen.  I decided to give this one a chance but it managed to be even worse.The first segment where the guy had a bionic eye was so lame, the zombie people and the makeup for them was a total joke.  This reminded me of movies that people made in high school for class projects using ketchup for blood.I almost always love horror anthology movies but this makes Creepshow 3 look like a masterpiece.Please don't make any more VHS movies.Biggest waste of money ever.  I would rather have paid ten dollars to have someone punch me in the face.  I would rather have someone stab me than watch this movie again."
"Nine Things about the Movie &#8220;V/H/S/2&#8221; [USA, Indonesia, 2013]1. In 2012, &#8220;V/H/S&#8221; was released. It was an anthology horror film, about some people that break into someone&#8217;s house in the middle of the night. They find a room of VHS tapes, and one person stays behind to watch the tapes, which turn out to be &#8220;found footage&#8221; horror films. There was about 10 minutes of interesting material in the whole movie.2. Here&#8217;s V/H/S/2&#8221;. It is an anthology horror film, about some people that break into someone&#8217;s house in the middle of the night. They find a room of VHS tapes, and one person stays behind to watch the tapes, which turn out to be &#8220;found footage&#8221; horror films. There is about 5 minutes of interesting material in the whole movie..3. The first story is about a guy that gets a video camera for an eyeball, which lets him see dead people that move his video game controller and teapot. He meets a girl that got an electric ear, which lets her hear dead people, including her fat uncle. She has to take her clothes off to get him to leave. Together, they meet other dead people, who are mean.4. The second story is about a zombie attack. Now, you might think that a zombie attack, told from the point of view of a camera on a zombie, would be interesting. But you would be wrong.5. The third story is about a cult that waits until a documentary crew arrives before they go on a murderous rampage and give birth to a demon. The story makes absolutely no sense, but it&#8217;s the best story of the whole movie just because it has the most gore.6. The fourth story is about a group of teenagers that like to have sex and masturbate. But their fun is ruined when aliens invade their house and start killing them. This time, we know the whole terrible story because a camera was attached to the family dog.7. This movie underscores the problem with &#8220;found footage&#8221; horror films. Everybody needs to be filming everything at all times. People need to have cameras in their eyes, on their bikes, on their helmets, in their clothes, in their house, in their car, and on their dog. And they need to all be filming 24/7. And once everybody is dead, someone has to find all the footage and edit it together into a story.8. If you think the &#8220;Paranormal Activity&#8221; films are documentaries, this movie might scare you. Otherwise you will laugh at the cheap effects, the cheap scares, and the cheap acting. Characters will think of the stupidest thing to do, and then do it. Not to mention the fact that each story barely has a plot, anyway.9. This movie proves that &#8220;found footage&#8221; horror films have not only jumped the shark, they&#8217;re not even in the water anymore."
Watched it coz Anna Kendrick is on it. It was a complete waste of time. 1+ hours of my life I can't get back.
"Watched it a couple of weeks ago and it's so forgettable I can't remember anything memorable other than it was a mishmash of scenes, cliched dialogue and stereotyped acting that seemed sourced from an hallucinogenic teen cartoon mag."
"Ah well , an unoriginal fantasy series about a female heroine having to save the world , does that ever get old . No stories , no writing and no point to it ."
An interesting idea that will probably be poorly executed.  I just can't stand the same ole made-for-TV unrealistic human dialog and behavior.  The writing is low-grade amaturish mixed with corporate ineptness.
"Started out with promise, but I'll never see the end.  I had to stop watching after the episode when a truck runs into the water tower and destroys the water tower.  I can't believe Speilberg and King would put out an end product like this.  Did King really write this drivel?It really is awful.  The storyline is terribly stunted, predictable, and full of amazing ""coincidences.""  The number of townspeople seems to swell on an as-needed basis.  It really is awful.Such a disappointment."
"I can't watch anymore, the acting is soooo bad that I'm wishing for the demise of the characters....I haven't read the book, but from those you had they are totally disgusting with the total change in the story.....regardless, if you read it or not, it's soooo boring and lame and speaking of lame seeing that stupid pudgy blonde politically correct Mom with the Muppet glasses pretending to be a doctor is so distracting it's hilarious---she looks like Benny Hill in drag.....I hope the whole cast suffocates in that Dome...."
"The first few episodes were ok, the story lines were interesting enough, and it wasn't overly sensational. However, the series has degenerated into adrenaline-junkie fodder, and with no intellectual layers to the story line, there is nothing here but chaos. It feels more like a video game than a television show."
"Show started strong but then network saw its ratings were strong and decided to milk it for another season,  going off on tangents with minor characters, and the show just became stagnant and boring."
"The town of Chester's Mill is sealed off from the rest of the world by an invisible dome. The inhabitants - and various visitors - have to manage dwindling supplies and social disorder whilst trying to figure out how to escape.We live in a golden age of television, with TV shows pushing further in crafting excellent narratives and creating compelling characters out of even the most mundane of situations. Rising budgets and production values mean that TV shows now often look like movies, sometimes with big movie stars opting for the less-lucrative but more creatively and artistically rewarding opportunities to slowly explore and develop characters over hours and maybe years. It's a great time to be a TV fan.Under the Dome therefore stands as a stark warning that we should not be complacent or overconfident that this is a state that will last forever. Under the Dome is a horrible show, so terrible that on a fundamental level all involved with it must know how bad it is, and therefore can only have made it deliberately as a warning to others to stay on the ball and avoid this show's pitfalls.Under the Dome is based on Stephen King's quite excruciatingly awful novel of the same name, but in a move that is actually impressive, is awful for completely different reasons. The primary weaknesses of King's novel - the ludicrous implausibility at how quickly everything disintegrates and its unhealthy obsession with raping Twilight fans (seriously Stephen, we know you're a Harry Potter fan but that's just juvenile) - are fortunately missing from the TV show. Brian K. Vaughan - the man credited with saving Lost from a dip in form during its early third season - has great credentials and is a good enough writer to know what to change from the book (i.e. almost everything apart from the dome itself and a few character names) to make it work on TV. But pretty much none of it does work.The biggest problem is the total lack of decent, compelling characters. Our main lead appears to be Dale 'Barbie' Barbara, but he is a rather unsympathetic killer and thug. Actor Mike Vogel initially gives it his all, but after a couple of episodes seems to realise that the inexplicable lurches in his character's motivations aren't going away and decides to sleep-walk through the rest of the series. Rachelle Lefevre also gamely engages with her character of Julia before realising she doesn't have a character, just a cliche (unconventional journalist from out of town with totally amazing hair), and likewise phones it in. The young kids are more enthusiastic and get some credit for being the only people in town actually bothered about what the dome is and where it came from, but their lack of experience and some poor direction results in them lurching from painfully over-acting to massively underselling big moments.There are some good points in the cast. Natalie Martinez's character of Linda has some bizarre character turns and is rather gullible at times, but she at least just about manages to sell the idea of a character cracking up from the stress of the situation (whether that was the aim or not). Dean Norris also brings some much-needed charisma to the antagonistic role of 'Big Jim' Rennie, even if some of his quite astonishing lines are delivered through teeth hugely gritted as he tries to forget he went from filming Breaking Bad to this mess (a drop in quality only comparable to Natalie Portman appearing in Black Swan and then Your Highness). However, the good work of others is undone by Alexander Koch as Junior. His utter lack of acting talent and the way he seems to have only three stand-by expressions he moves between, sometimes randomly, is almost hypnotic. It's certainly the worst performance by a regular in a TV series that I've seen in many, many years.The writing is also awful. Brian K. Vaughan has some seriously good work to his name, but he seems unable to employ it here. Dialogue is expositionary, unconvincing and wooden in the extreme. You can predict how entire scenes will go - sometimes down to lines - from their opening moments. The show also starts back-pedalling from its premise - a bunch of people trapped together in a dome - immediately by periodically bringing in new characters and unconvincingly explaining they've been in hiding since the dome came down. When the writing doesn't even have the courage to deal with the basic premise of the show, there's a huge problem.Under the Dome's first season (*) is almost irredeemably bad. The writing is almost completely bad, the acting is mostly bad, very little about it (from character motivations to the supply situation to the utter lack of contact with the outside world after the third or fourth episode) makes any kind of sense and the whole thing feels like a big, dead, inert weight. A few flashes of competence from a couple of the actors are the only thing that makes watching it even remotely bearable. Still, it's a vast improvement on the novel."
"The first couple of episodes were just okay. The most interesting part was when Junior locked the girl from the diner in his storm cellar. I was rooting for her to escape. But I had to turn episode 7 off when two females started kissing. To me, this is just a glorified attempt to get more ratings. The premise of the show was already good. The addition of this other stuff was unnecessary. They should focus on better acting and less sensationalism. Anyway, it wasn't enough to keep me watching. So, I'm done."
"The second episode told me I had wasted my time watching the first episode.  For fiction, to watch all these shows with no idea of how or why there is this dome and the implications was too much for me to continue watching.  These kind of shows are a cheap version of science fiction in which they can use some set of some farm somewhere without any special effects or imagination of any kind.  A cheap version of a good sci-fi movie."
"Do they even know what a miniseries is?I can tell you, it doesn't have Seasons. This should have ended with episode 13. On that, (and pretty much the bad acting, nonsensical actions of the characters and horrendous dialogue)  I give this show a 1."
"This series feels overly contrived.  The characters' aren't believable.  They're all cartoonish, and have that &#34;tv&#34; level of attractiveness.  Like every &#34;average town&#34; in tv-land=a Los Angeles casting agency full of cutsey, dimpled Abercrombie & Fitch models.  The whole dome itself just isn't that interesting.  A similar concept was explored and adapted into a film in Stephen King's The Mist.  Being a film, the CGI is much better, and the cinematography was much more thrilling.  Maybe if Under the Dome was a miniseries, and on a network like HBO, it could have been something great."
"I like SciFi, a lot. It promotes forward thinking IMO.This series started out with a cool idea, of ""what if"".With Stephen King as the writer, and Steven Spielberg as the director, WOW, I was excited.Ouch. Ouch.  Arggh! This show is SO bad.If Steven Spielberg is REALLY directing this- he should be arrested, and then sent home with a monitoring device. Or, he should see his doctor to find out what is wrong with him.*No, I'm no wannabe writer- I'm a ticked off viewer!How the heck do these two entertainment giants, let such a BAD show air, with their names?There, will no longer be any... Oh, if Spielberg is directing ""I've got to see it"" in our family. Or, ""If Stephen King wrote it"", I should order it.  NOPE.For US. This is a TOTAL Sell-out from both of you. You should be ashamed that your names are on this GARBAGE.I feel sorry for the actors as well. Poor things, having to try to make this garbage watchable.Shame on both of you.Ok. I'm done."
"the only decent and believable characters are the good looking secretive guy and the teenage boy trying to figure out what is going on. the idea is interesting, but i don't think they have executed the show very well. i stopped watching after a few episodes."
"I'm a sucker for sci fi shows--this one is no different.Under the Dumb started out mildly interesting, borrowing the incredible momentum and star power of Breaking Bad's Dean Norris.  But the poor writing and 2 dimensional character of Big Jim (who should be called ironically slim jim on the basis that his character is homogenously distasteful and lacking of character) is disappointing.  This is not due to Norris's shortcomings, because he was simply incredible in Breaking Bad.  It's that Dome has a stupid story arc the writers lost somewhere in the filing cabinent...and to compensate, they drag their feet by creating a bunch of non-likable characters that undergo unimportant tribulations that do not contribute to moving the story along.  You kind of wish the series would be 2 episodes long and they'd all suffocate to death.This show is slower than Walking Dead for events to actually happen.  It makes you wait even longer than LOST. Are they expecting 12 seasons this time?The drama and interpersonal relationships are seriously flawed.  We don't care about the red head and her problematic husband, or 'barbie' (he's a doll, get it?  Ew).  We don't care about big jim (he's evil.  got it.).  Or his son (he's evil, but maybe..just maybe he could be good.  Got it--Boredom).  We don't care about the son's dramatic magical girlfriend.  Or the droll magical daughter of the two lesbians.  Or her nerdy teen leader brother.  Or anyone.  They are all terrible characters without any depth whatsoever.  The show focuses on them, and tries to make the dome as a metaphor for creating a microcosm in which these characters have to figure things out.  Only they go nowhere fast and they have no depth.I watch this show at 1.5x speed using VLC while reading reddit.  I can actually keep up with it.  Which means it's not a smart show and it probably entrains people into drooling stupidly for an hour (I have the chest puddle to prove it).  It's a show that is so slow it makes Walking Dead look exciting.  It makes you think the sheriff is talking way too fast to understand.  ""Nah downt cheeew goooh tew fer, nah boweh""As far as story, it's as potentially enticing as Failing Skies, but equally disappointing in the actual end-result.  As some have said on forums,  it's not supposed to be 1/10 as good as 1980s V with Beastmasters Marc Singer!If these were our only choices, and there weren't great HBO shows to balance them out, I would think this is the beginning of the end of the human race in a slow decline into idocracy."
"OK. I don't get it. I really gave this a shot but, after watching the very first episode I have officially given up on this one. The premise of an invisible dome covering a town is OK but cutting a cow in half was ridiculous. As soon as that happened I knew it was over. It's not that any of the things  that happened in the show couldn't happen but it's just that everything was so cheezy. I give up on this one. The special effects don't cut it and the acting is ""so-so"". I'm digging under the dome and escaping."
"However, it is being picked up for a second season, which means that the people will still be under the dome.We watched Lost for a season or two until it became apparent that the story line had no real resolution and it reverted, in effect, to a soap opera.Many of us like a story to be told and the d&eacute;nouement to be reached within a season or less, including the various subplots that serve as a hook to hold viewers.Added 20 September 2013: Now that the 13th episode is over, we find that our suspicions are confirmed. We feel that we were tricked into watching what we thought was a miniseries complete in itself. Instead, we see that Under the Dome is just another techno-soap opera with no real resolution in sight. The plot was dragged out and the characters distorted to allow for continuing season(s). We will NOT be watching the future season or seasons."
"I wanted this show to be a favorite soooo much!  After the second episode i felt incredibly let down!  I did stomach the entire first season, but just because i was clinging for hope!  I did not read the book till after watching it, and neither one lived up to my expectations!  The show lacked a single intelligent person the ENTIRE time!  If they wanted to undermine the intelligence of the viewers, mission accomplished!  I was completely offended by how they portrayed the people of the Midwest, i do not recommend this show."
"I can understand the necessity of some divergence from the book and characters, and I even understand the rationale for some of the specific changes they made, but there's a serious disconnect between the two. That's OK, because the book was even worse. But even though a lot happens in each episode, yet it seems like little forward motion in the story. It drags. And worst of all, the acting is truly awful in nearly all cases. Many good series with good writing, good stories, good actors get cancelled. They're going to renew this for a second season? Only because it has Stephen King's name on it. Don't waste the precious hours of your life on this."
"The first episode of this series was great.  Incredible effects.  Neat puzzle to solve.  As it progressed, I just wanted to see the show end.  Extending it into a second season is ridiculous."
I had been following mini series on cbs and it said to watch finale go to amazon. so o rented the last episode thinking it was the end because it was suppose to be a 1 season show and it turned out i already saw it not knowing cbs was carrying it over to next season so i paid for something i already saw. But I like the show.
"I love sci-fi, but the storyline here is unimaginative, feels hokey, the characters feel shallow & made for tv.  There's nothing enjoyable about this show after the initial dome scenes."
"Probably going to happen in the future right? Hey we don't like some country gassing people, cover the regime with a dome. Watch them eat each other like rats in a box."
"Didn't really give it a fair shot, but seemed predictable."
"I think this show is only for people wholike extreme fiction.  The show seemsto be well done, just not my style."
"While not strictly a SK fan, I have read some good stories of his. As usual, TV/movie adaptations tend to stray from the original story line. I have not read the SK book Under the Dome, but most reviews I have read indicate that in this case, the only similarity to the book is the names of the characters. Having said that, all I can add is that this seems to be a poorly written script combined with even poorer acting.  Forget about the ""effects"". If the writing and acting were good, they could carry the show on their own, but in this case, not even fantastic effects could save the show. Like I said, Not For Me.  For those of you prepared to suffer it out just because it's ""free"" under Prime, great, enjoy."
"Every once is a blue-moon someone makes an excellent movie or tv version of a Stephen King novel. This is not one of those times. Like most King translations, Under the Dome is extremely poor, and a tremendous letdown compared to the original material. The primary flaw with Under the Dome is the unbelievably poor acting. Only two actors are doing an acceptable job (Big Jim and his son), and neither of them are main characters. There are other problems as well, but that one alone is enough to make this series a definite ""pass"" to anyone who places value on decent acting."
"Under the Dome [0558 - 07-18-2014]Summary:A small town is suddenly and inexplicitly sealed off from the rest of the world by a transparent dome. No communication can pass through the dome.Content & Packaging:4 disks - 13 episodes - standard DVD packaging. Several special features and few deleted scenes.Positive Comments: I bought this set used. I hope I can sell it to someone else - quickly.The Cast:With rare exception the ensemble cast for this show - Wiki lists 30 speaking roles - is uniformly bland and undistinguished. The most memorable character - a drug addled old preacher was killed off around episode 4. Dean Norris as &#34;Big Jim&#34; Rennie looks exhausted by the silly plots and dialogue he must contend with.Negative Comments: (where do I begin) Some of the worst plotted TV shows I have ever seen. For example a &#34;real cute guy&#34; working as debt collector for a bookie kills his client in a brawl. Quickly his digs a grave and buries the body just as the dome comes down with him inside. His victim's wife - she is real cute too - is frantic concerning her missing husband. Fast-forward a few episodes and the murderer is shacking up with the wife like nothing ever happened a couple of days ago - no remorse, no &#34;is this kinda weird' type conversations - I could go on and on. The few deleted scenes are at the end of disk 2, 3 & 4 but no reference is provided to the episode. Unbelievable this show will have a season 2.Recommendations:If you like shows about cute, precocious teens dressed in the latest fashions - falling in and out of love - going into trances and speaking nonsense when they touch fingertips - and can decipher the domes mysteries - then you will like this show."
"I am looking for the perfect show t watch..Under the Dome was not it!!!!! Lost me in the first 2 episodes. I loved Sons of Anarchy, Justified and Breaking Bad.....need another series like them!!!!"
"This miniiseries has been hyped for months, and when it finally gets here, it is mostly soap opera,  a few gross amputations and a cow split in half.... Not particularly scary or anything.  King's IT was far more tense."
"The characters except for the adolescents are largely unlikable , the pace. Is glacial And the mcguffin is not too interesting. The villain is so transparent I wouldn't believe him at all except he seems to be acting like a typical member of Congress- so Big Jim at least is something"
"This started out on a good note with the premise of a small town engulfed in a transparent dome, but it soon fades into oblivion with its cliche' riddled writing and so...so acting. Is King so hard up for money that he signs off on anything they throw at him when it comes to making his books into a TV series? Can anyone remember the last King TV series that was good? Many are comparing this to Lost, but I can't comment on that since after watching a few episodes of Lost and its ""dog chasing its tail"" stories I had enough. Each weeks story on UTD kept getting more and more ridiculous with Big Jim and Barbie's over the top antics and the dumb as dirt blind leading the blind sheriff and town folk. People really get paid to write this kind of drivel and still others get paid to produce it? This is garbage TV at its worst. I know that I'm in the minority here, but come on people do you really think that this is that good?Rating 0 to 5 stars.Story = 4 For the premise and 2 for the actual stories.Direction = 2 The director is not getting good performances out of the cast.Acting = 1 to 3 The acting ranges from bad to average.Intrest Level = 1 to 2 The bad acting combined with the lack of creative writing makes me yawn.Violence = 3+ There are some good fight scenes and gun play.Sex = Yes, but its network TV, so nothing very hot here.Foul Language = Yes, but its network TV, so you will hear much worse walking in the mall.Entertainment Value = 1 This series only took three episodes before it started to tank."
"The absolute worst part of the series is the character ""Junior"" which is made even worse by poor acting.  I have watched five episodes and wonder when people will start to understand the food and gas are going to run out.  Most characters seem to have gone on with their lives and find the dome a minor inconvenience after after the first episode. I  have seen the black actress in two series, does she think she is the new Yul Bryner?  Poor writing (not King's fault), incredibly poor acting, and implausible plot.  Could someone tell me why the outside  government makes no attempt to have a real conversation with the people inside, maybe help them understand something about the dome? Why can't they use writing to communicate, the dome appears to be transparent. If you were chained up in a bomb shelter for days would you forgive the perpetrator in 10 seconds?"
"like many other people here, I read the book & loved it!but this show... it's like a multi-car pileup of a car wreck on the highway - you don't WANT to see it as you inch slowly by, but you just... can't... turn... away...yes, it's THAT BAD!& yes, I watched the whole season just waiting to see any glimmer of the book peeking throughabout all that made it were the names of some of the characters & the fact that there was an unexplained ""dome"" dropped on the town in which they liveit's like someone told someone else about this awesome book they read & then that person went & did hard drugs for a decade or two & with their last two brain cells decided to write a tv show ""based on"" said bookugh& there's going to be more of it, I hearsigh... when will they ever just take one of his books & do it right??!an extended format ""mini"" series is PERFECT for his novels - long enough to fit in most, if not all, of the characters & nuances, but not endless like a regular tv series where it just goes on & on & ruins the premiseso sad :("
"Under the Dome is chock full of shallow, unbelievable, stereotypical characters. Heavy handed writing. Cliched groan worthy dialogue. MADE FOR TV is practically written all over it.What do we have here? It's hard to impart just how bad this is without watching it, so here are a few choice moments.Nice college kid turns psychopath in one instant. No build up. No character development. Just a switch going off. I don't think so.Beautiful married woman invites iffy looking stranger home. I do not think so.Kids are dropping and having ""seizures"". Dramatic and utterly fake.Teenager runs to sheriff and says sheriff sheriff, help. Now we're back to the 1950s. Kids don't talk like that. His sister works in a diner. Yawn. Parents trapped elsewhere. ""We're on our own"". Oh no!! Um, you're like 15 and 17 or so. Deal with it.Female deputy who looks almost exactly like the deputy from Eureka. At first I thought: why is Erica Cerra typecasting herself? But no, it's not her. The problem? I don't know, it's just odd.It's not the 80's any more. We've had the Sopranos, Fringe, Game of Thrones and recently House of Cards from Netflix, to name but a few well known shows. We've seen depth and amazing production values, high quality cinematography, Shakespearean level acting. We've seen deep, complex, multilayered shows.And then we see this. What is this? Why is this? Why make something so dull? What for?"
"The show sounded thrilling; however, after watching it, the show seems lackluster.  The show is not thrilling and it lacks any suspense. It tries to have an air of mystery about it but it just doesn't come off very interesting.  Perhaps it is the wooden acting by the three main characters or perhaps it is the directing.  It seemed the mystery came second to a high school love triangle.  I just didn't care for the characters, the relationships and the lack of suspense the ""mystery"" portions of the show contained."
"Uninspired directing looms darkly over this AWFUL script that is already inundated with negative, cruel humor. From bland, uninteresting shot choices to meager performances with moderate intentions, Coffee Town is one of the worst movies I have seen in some time. I thought it would have promise because (although I expected some negativity and cynicism from them) it was a joint effort from CollegeHumor and the guys from Always Sunny... but just doesn't have any heart or comeuppanceto win back a little empathy for the characters, and so it just falls completely flat and unfunny."
"Nope nope nope. Boring, predictable, poor acting, silly dialogue, try's to be cute bite doesn't make it so just annoying"
This movie is one of the worst i have ever seen. But Im  not sure what i expected from the title. I was wondering how people got away with selling drugs. All this was is a diary of a few drug addicts and dealers.
"This film is extremely one-sided. It promotes the views and opinions of drug dealers, other criminals, and wannabe criminals. It is intentionally misleading, and often what they claim is an outright lie. There is plenty of valid and verifiable evidence that demonstrates exactly how drug use is crippling our society at all levels. Yes, there is some corruption in law enforcement. But the typical law enforcement officer is honest, and earnestly abides by the laws her/she is sworn to uphold. People who become cops because they like excitement, or power, or just want to feel like a bad ass, rarely last long on the job. They are easy to identify and in most cases are quickly weeded out of the force. This film tries to turn reality upside down by portraying the police as evil scumbags, and portraying violent, cutthroat drug dealers as victims instead of the lowlife criminals that they really are."
"This is torturous to watch. I couldn't stand listening to the dreadful, smug and pompous speakers, let alone look at their faces. It is painful, like the university lecture course with a cadre of self important twits droning on about things that are of no importance to a significant topic. Save yourself the pain and skip this documentary."
"This film begins with platitudes about opening your mind and questioning authority. Once your mind is pried open a bit, it begins to drop in quotations by neo-Marxist philosophers, Howard Zinn, pictures of leftist protest signs. It is peppered with random false statements like 'banking is based on fraud', 'genetics is destroying farmers'.This movie bothers me because it is propaganda. It's not about opening your mind, it's about reprogramming your mind. They keep telling you that you're a credulous, brainwashed sheep, and obviously they really believe that of you.The best criticism of our current economic situation that I've seen is Robert Reich's &#34;Inequality for All&#34;. I think he really gets at the root of the problem, and does not offer as solution a system that is even worse than what we have."
"I can't believe Elijah lent himself to this trash.  If acting is looking wide-eyed during the entire movie then all the ""actors"" did their job."
"The 1980 original is a classic and it still gives me chills when I see it.. Joe Spinell gave the character so much dimension and creepy insane authenticity. This new version is not only bad, it's boring and hard to believe Elijah's character being able to slash a piece of paper, let alone have the strength murder anyone.. He's as scary as a stack of pancakes... I mean, really, someone as weak and scrawny as Woods is going to murder a screaming woman in the middle of a parking lot, in the middle of a city with all those tall buildings around, and you're going to tell me NO ONE is going to see it?? Please... So all of this hype surrounding this remake and it just amounts to yet another clich&eacute; slasher mess trying to pretend to be a remake or indie art, when in fact, it could never stand on it's own two feet.. without Woods or the audacity to try and consider itself a remake... But to be fair, the first 3 minutes were good, but from then on, horrible.."
"Child molester's are not great with kids! They traumatize children for life with their psychotic justification for abuse, religious or otherwise. Who is the freak that wrote this episode?"
Why in the world was this show produced? It's horrible. I couldn't force myself to finish. Ugh. Such a complete waste of time.
"I only watched part way though the first episode and had to turn it off.  Showing a celebrity throw up is not my idea of entertainment,"
I could not even get through the first 15 minutes of the first episode.  Would you hang out sober in a bar for yuks? Ask any bar tender...
"Browsing through the Amazon catalog of streaming movies and saw this one and its ratings, so I took a peek at one of the episodes (can't remember now which one) and within just a few minutes of watching and fast forwarding I knew this particular video wasn't for me.  I have nothing really bad to say about it, actors, story, etc., just wasn't something that held my interest."
"Just drunk guys, who don't know anything at all about history, ranting about &#34;history&#34; while they're inebriated. Silly and not even funny."
Hoping for laughs and learning - not my style of humor and learning too little for time invested. Some younger may like it.
"If this is the only way to get somebody to learn history, we have a social problem of epic proportions.  Bad bad message.  I watched a few shows and was appalled.  There are a million documentaries with better content, and the delivery isn't coming from someone who is slurring, puking, or curled up on the floor.  How low can you go."
"I only watched one show, I wasn't entertained, puking into a trash can, get a life. . . it sucks"
Intellectually and entertainingly void of any value. Kind of like a high school home movie that went viral.  Drunks gone wild.
"I thought this would be a series about the impact of alcohol on history.  Instead,  it's drunks attempting to relate their versions of historical events. If there was nothing else to watch I'd turn off the TV before I'd watch this program."
"Disgusting, revolting, socially unacceptable, morally reprehensible.America at a new low.This is the worst kind of presentation. It is demeaning, insulting, insensitive, moronic, vile and absolutely valueless. In the first five minutes we get apparently really drunk people on-camera trying to be entertaining - not - and then just to show the true veracity of the premise, one of the actors throws up on screen and they SHOW it.I hope everyone involved in this disgusting piece of tripe has a life full of karmic consequences for this bizarre and terrible, terrible idea.Amazon - remove this foul piece of pap before it turns away more customers - what were they thinking when they did this - oh yeah, they were drunk...yeah that's what I want to deal with, drunken mediocrity, vomit, misinformation, and the insane idea that anything in this is &#34;funny&#34; - it is not, it is an insult to decency.."
not interested.
I didn't watch this it lost my interest the first few minutes of it.
Bad. Did not watch past first ten minutes.
"cant give zero stars so settle for one, it just sucked, couldnt even finish this F movie. definately time wasted"
10 mins = nothing20 mins = nothing30 mins = yawn... what time is it?40 mins = nothing45 mins = oh- wait a minute... is something happening!?!47 mins = nope  :(55 mins = left the movie running while taking a bathroom break.65 mins = mind actually started drifting off thinking about my morning commute to work.75 mins = I give up.skip it- you won't regret it!
I was very disappointed with the show and the plot. I am sorry I purchased it. Learned my lesson about buying a full season and not knowing what the show is about.
"The movie was very boring, not enough good in it to watch.  Definitely different from all the other Tyler Perry movies that is for certain.  Would not watch it again or even recommend it to anyone."
"I really hated this movie. All of the mopey sadness of a bad Tyler Perry movie. What's more significant is that my family, which is generally enthralled with all Tyler Perry productions, didn't like it either. Skip it"
The title is the only thing tempting about this boring movie. Don't waste your money. I was so disappointed ugh.
"So basically this entire film is a combination of the found footage genre and pseudo documentary with reality tv style confessionals narrating it.  There really is no story, or characters.  There's just exposition and scientific explanation of what is happening.  Basically astronauts go to one of jupiter's moons and get killed by a space squid living in the ice.  That's really it.  The entire movie takes place in a couple rooms representing the inside of the space ship.  The space is just black green screen.  You don't even see Jupiter in the film.  The film is just horribly boring.  It isn't worth the time it takes to watch it."
Utterly devoid of entertainment value. Makes you long for the old end-of-day test pattern.
"By now, it should be safe to assume that the majority of us have either seen or at least heard about the new space thriller, Gravity.  Arguably one of the best films of 2013, it's safe to assume that (in the not so distant future) there will be a steady flow of space dramas coming our way in a cheap attempt to cash in on the massive success of Gravity.  Naturally, it's no coincidence that the independent space drama, Europa Report, was released on home video just days after the release of the Bullock/Clooney blockbuster.Directed by Sebasti&aacute;n Cordero (Rage, Chronicles), Europa Report stars Embeth Davidtz as Dr. Unger, the head of a corporation that privately funds an outer space mission, Europa One, to investigate potential life on one of the moons of Jupiter.  In a documentary-style format and using various camera footage shot aboard the space shuttle, Unger tells the story of six astronauts that successfully land on one of Jupiter's moon and attempt to research the surface, which is made partially of ice - a sign that the moon may inhabit life forms.  Anamaria Marinca, Karolina Wydra, Michael Nyqvist, Daniel Wu, Sharlto Copley, & Christian Camargo also star in supporting roles.Since Europa Report was conveniently released (on home video) on the coattails of Gravity, it warrants a quick comparison to the buzz-worthy blockbuster.  If we use the opinion of James Cameron, who called Gravity ""the best space film ever done,"" Europa Report could easily be called the worst space film ever done.  Much like the great unknown of outer space, these types of films obviously thrive on the simple premise that anything that could wrong will go wrong.  Feel free to look for an outer space flick in which everything is all hunky-dory for its entirety - and in the event that such a film did exist, it would most likely be the equivalent of watching paint dry.  In any event, while Gravity thrived largely due to beautiful visuals, above average thrills, A-list actors, and an easily understandable plot, Europa Report nearly fails in comparison in each and every category.It's painfully evident that Europa Report lacks a clear and comprehensible direction in regards to who the characters are and what their particular purpose is over the course of this film.  Obviously, Daniel Wu portrays the captain, but at no point does he ever appear to be in command of anything.  These actors and actresses are completely devoid of emotion, dimension, and for lack of a better word - interest.  If the point of this film was to be a documentary-style flick in which viewers were not supposed to care about the characters within it, then it was a smashing success.  But, as far as the entertainment value of the character development, this film is absent of potential.  These characters, portrayed by completely unrecognizable actors and actresses, simply go through the motions of the script, which is nearly a full hour and a half of bumbling around a space shuttle.The most bothersome aspect of the film is the constant jumping from bad camera view to bad camera view.  Unfortunately, this style of film-making deprives the film of a smooth delivery, directly stemming from the space cams, which take away the experience of watching a movie and turn this film into an outer space version of big brother.  One minute you'll be watching the crew eat dinner and then you'll suddenly be viewing a swing arm and solar panels in outer space - as if they will eventually come into meaning (which they don't).  In a noble act, this film sticks with the documentary-style of storytelling, but just when scenes attempt to pick up, they are quickly broken up by random analysis from spectators (presumably on Earth) who attempt to explain the fallout and existential circumstances of the Europa One mission.  When you combine aspects, they make for a frustrating viewing experience.While the film's execution is overly frustrating, the story is still on the money in terms of how humanity might one day approach space exploration.  To be honest, there's nothing sexy about this film and is a far cry from some of the sci-fi flicks moviegoers have been spoiled with in recent years, like Prometheus, Star Trek, or Moon.  Still, the authenticity of Europa Report is admirable - as it clearly aims to depict a film that would dwarf the magnitude of the moon landing.  The significance of this story is there, but the emotion is years beyond comprehension, because when/if the day comes that life is discovered on another planet, people might just look back on this film and make a distinct comparison.Overall, Europa Report is a dismal and disappointing movie to sit through.  Realistically, all you need to know about this film is that six astronauts land on a moon orbiting Jupiter and then fast-forward to the last twenty minutes - where you'll finally ""see the light.""  You'll miss absolutely nothing of relevance, regardless of what happens to the characters along the way.  The climax of this film is it's only saving grace, thus preventing it from earning a complete failing grade.  For a film that's supposed to be thrilling, one could only assume that the most thrilling portions of this film were left on the cutting room floor.  Any other explanation would lead you to believe that the writers and filmmakers suffer from sheer incompetence when it comes to making an entertaining film.  Do yourself a favor and don't even bother giving this film a chance.  The brief 90 minutes of your life which it would cost you to watch this film (along with money presumably) will surely be better spent doing absolutely anything else.GRADE:  D-FNDNreview.com"
"This &#34;movie&#34; which is shot like a made-for-television movie from the 1960's, is slow moving, boring, and uneventful. I tried to watch it all the way through, and managed to do so --but only after six attempts over a two day period. I literally kept falling asleep.That being said, maybe this is a medical breakthrough in the making. Yes, it is clearly an effective and safe way to treat insomnia, but I believe it has an even better use.In terminal patients, one would hope they might pass calmly, even willingly. Showing this movie will help ANYONE facing death make the decision to let go. After 20-30 minutes of this, death would be a sweet and welcome blessing."
"Don't be fooled by the ""NASA Approved!"" sticker.  This is another low budget space disaster flick that focuses on cheap scares and pointless twists instead of discovery and exploration, just like Sunshine, Ghost of Mars, Event Horizon and a whole host of other manic depressive movies that wander into space.This director should be cranking out pictures about flea-bitten drunks slowly dying in gutters instead of science fiction.  If we took all the cash doled out for these ""space is scary"" oeuvres we'd have enough to build a dozen space ships by now.When one character in the film mutters ""It's pointless,"" I kinda have to agree with him.But if downer sci-fi is your cup of tea then you'll be weeping into your Tang in no time after watching this found footage flick."
This movie was dull and uninteresting .  It had very little information about the life of Norsemen.  The story was disjointed and dull. I would not recommend it to anyone.
"I hope I wasn't charged for this show, I didn't watch it, have no idea what it's about, I don't care that much about men's suits."
"This show used to be about two guys, one a cocky attorney and one a genius pretending to be an attorney, and it was also about the interesting process of trying to survive as a rookie (with secrets) in a highly competitive law firm, a topic which had never really been explored before. And the writers did a good job, for a while. But - and this is what gave it moral weight - it was also about clients. Clients. That's right, real people, non-attorneys in danger from the law, who needed very good representation to win them justice.Then, as season 2 ground on, this show became only about the war-ing egos WITHIN the law firm, the jostling for power that the writers just make up the rules for as they go along - and it had so many twists and turns that no outcome was ever earned dramatically. It became like watching a bunch of smart alecks exchanging zingers - the equivalent of teenage boys in an alley saying, ""No,YOUR mother eats golf balls."" Or whatever. Gabriel Macht (Harvey) is a very watchable actor, but the writers no longer give his character anything that means more to him than his own vanity. Patrick J. Adams (Mike) is a very limited actor, and he can't convincingly play a hetero guy. He may be one, I don't know or care - but he can't PLAY one. Yet his story arc has degenerated into: ""But Rachel, don't you love me, now that we had completely unconvincing frantic sex in the law library?""We need stories that aren't just about a bunch of overinflated egos vying for dominance in a sterile corporate environment. Ultimately, the human ego is boring. We need stories. There aren't any."
This movie tries too hard to be smart and witty but instead is just boring.  The rambling dialog of the man's best friend is especially irritating. The actors are supposed to be wildly in love with each other but never seem to pull off the illusion.  With such a great cast I thought this movie would be a good choice.  I was very disappointed.  Don't waste your time or $10 like I did.
"A game British cast and co-writer of Sacha Baron Cohen movies in the director&#8217;s chair, led to this movie described as a &#8216;reverse rom-com&#8217; by some.  It&#8217;s laudable to attempt a spin on the worn out premises rolled out time and time again in Hollywood rom-coms, and the cast seem well suited to their roles.  We have the central couple who we see at the start embarking on their marriage, their bitter and unhappily married friends, a best friend / best man who reaches new heights of inappropriateness and lack of social graces, and an ex girlfriend of the groom.  As the movie rumbles on, with some blackly comic moments which may bring a guilty smile to your face, we are gradually introduced to the idea that this couples marriage is keeping them from the romances they really should be in.  As the conclusion becomes more inevitable, sadly, blackly inventive comedy becomes just irritatingly condescending and insulting. Counselling is portrayed as a ridiculous waste of time,  and the lies the couple tell each other are poked fun at.  Perhaps the worst indictment of a romantic comedy is that none of the leads are particularly likeable.  It&#8217;s really hard to care about whether they find their true love as depicted in the movie, and if anything we the audience have more investment in the marriage, flawed as it is, which leaves a sense of disappointment that they need to take the easy way out for the movie to reach its pat resolution.  And therein lies the insult.  The idea of a couple fighting to save their marriage is seen as futile, insulting all those who have succeeded in getting over their difficulties and finding happiness together, and the idea of a divorce is seen as a romantic light throwaway moment, insulting all those who have experienced directly or indirectly a divorce.  So yes, there are humourous moments, and Minnie Driver&#8217;s scabrous friend whose answers during charades give away everything but the answers is a highlight, but the humour always feels at a cost, and ultimately the movie does nothing to make you feel good and ultimately the laughs are hollow.Of course, there is always an audience for a movie.  For this movie, if you have a cynical streak about romance, believe that divorce is a worthy goal and that marriage is a singularly failed institution that kills true love, then this IS the movie for you.  Classic British comedy..?  No, I reckon it&#8217;ll be forgotten.  In fact, I give it a year."
"I never liked this show , it was repulsive and tried to make likable characters out of drug dealers and killers . This was more like the modern day Roman Gladiator games than a tv show ."
"Purchased one episode in hopes it would differ(a little spice added or at least be as good) from the original. But unfortunately, it contains the exact plot and the lines were &#34;word for word&#34; from original Swedish/Danish series. The cast is very disappointing, mainly Diane Kruger. Sofia Helin from the ORIGINAL series blows away the character (of the blonde female lead detective) with mesmerizing acting. BTW if the original was offered on Amazon it would be a 5 Star!"
"too violent.... more than other programs ... couldn't watch it... though for comparison, i found the killings on netflix gripping..."
I purchased the entire first season so I could compare to the original Swedish/ Danish original.  So far Amazon's Instant service is a bust!!  I can't see anything... only audio!  What gives.
"I found the bridge to be quite boring, the main character appears to be suffering from Asperger's and is quite one dimensional. The Mexican authorities appear to be suffering from every clich&eacute; which americans have heard about them"
"This movie looked promising, but was absolutely awful!  What a waste of money and time.  Poor acting, script and not funny at all.  This is the worst movie of 2013."
This tv show is just very boring and weird. Also the animation is absolutely repulsive and sore on the eyes. Its the kind of show that makes me wonder if the people at cartoon network are crackheads.
"Another ""Chiller"" release, this is yet (another) shining example of how turd movies are loosed upon the public through clever(?) advertising and trailers that really are better than the movie.Standard yarn about graduating teens going out for a last party.  One of them knows there's ""something in the lake,"" yet he thinks no one will go swimming even though they've all brought their suits.  The ""monster fish"" in this grade-D bomb looks like something a local junior high school trade shop made.  It is unrealistic, non-scary, and just mainly boring.  The movie might have worked better had it not decided to constantly show this puppet-shop creation.If I could, I would rate this a half-star, but Amazon seems to get all feisty if you try that!  Don't waste your time."
"Signs of bad:1. Cover is more scary than the what's in the movie. Called false advertising.2. Usual no-name studio, ""Chiller Films"". Usual no-name $100/day actors (OK, a few TV spots and similar cheap-to-make movies for their credits.)3. Usual dumbed down stereotypic plot hooks: Teens in car going to a remote site to party, with lots of boring scenes of van driving on road.4. Usual teen mix of hot chicks, jock, nerd/geek, cool quiet type guy.5. Usual stranded setup with no cell reception (so overused there are actual web sites that list all the no-cell-reception movies).6. Usual alcohol, usual dumb decisions, usual tension amongst are doomed group.7. So they get boat stranded on some small lake/reservoir. Only stranded in the sense that they can't figure out how to paddle a hundred yards to shore.8. Monster is one, and only one (reproduction is not in the cards) large catfish (they actually do get that big) with eyes on the top of it's head (why during their many chances our dummies didn't poke them out is beyond me). Eyes should have been on the side for a scavenging bottom feeder. Anyway, it's scary attribute are some teeth that are functionally pointless except for snagging on sunken trees.9. No scary or gory scenes except for a minimal amount of prosthetic blood tossed around."
"Six students who graduate from high school go up to a Black Lake property where quiet Johnny (Daniel Zovatto) has access and knowledge of the thing that lives in the lake. The six kids get stranded in a row boat in the lake attacked by a rubber headed flesh eating fish. In order to survive they end up voting someone off.The film does its horror style character build up in the vehicle on their way to the lake. From then on all the action takes place in the boat in this low budget production. If you like films like ""Altitude"" or ""Frozen"" where the action is limited and takes place in one location, this one is of that genre, but a little worse.No sex or nudity in this horror film. The fish monster is MST laughable, but the rest of the film lacks cheese character. The film would have been infinitely better had they made it to the island, had a party, got picked off one by one, then attempted to cross back vs. rubber head.My recommendation: Watch ""Two-Headed Shark Attack"" instead."
"08/28/2013 UPDATE- last night's episode was yet more proof that this show is really just derailed. According to the newest installment, it makes perfect sense that Auggie was actually a CIA operative FIRST in 2006, THEN joined the military, where he was blinded in 2007, and then went back to the CIA. Yeahhhhh, that's definitely a totally believable career progression. I mean, at this rate, the details of this season border on sci-fi. And Piper Perabo's acting is getting more and more stilted, making you think that she's planning her own exit or bored to tears with the script. RIDICULOUS.=============================================================================================================================ORIGINAL REVIEW:I've been watching this show from the beginning, and was already a little apprehensive about the somewhat predictably lame season 3 ending of Auggie and Annie falling into bed together (SNORE!). But I was completely unprepared for just how BAD this season would be. Not only does their relationship take center stage - right along with little inserts of the crumpled, limping relationship between Arthur and Joan who, surprise surprise, TV once again manages to produce a miracle and makes her pregnant at whatever age she's supposed to be (the actress herself being 43).I'm not sure what's worse in the show so far: the incredibly AWFUL, bad, awkward relationship between Auggie and Annie - replete with some of the worst cliches and stale lines you remember from bad 70s and 80s movies - that's so embarrassingly bad that you're variously wondering how the acting in a show can get WORSE with continuing seasons whent the actors should now be firmly entrenched in their characters, or think that it's as awkward as watching a real life brother-sister team fake a romantic relationship (yuck). Yes, it's THAT bad.And while there are the occasional moments when the show briefly returns to its former gusto, the thrills and suspense of previous seasons are few and far between. Mostly you witness Piper Perabo acting like she just got off the bus in Hollywood yesterday (and, let's face it, she's come a long way since Coyote Ugly) - and one can only hope that real spies have better skills than her because when you see scenes where she strolls around like Bambi, blissfully unaware of all the DANGERS!! around her, always waiting for some guy to rescue her...it's so groan-worthy that you just want to throw a well-heeled shoe at the tv and yell MAKE THEM STOP!All of those things just seem to be distractions from a lack of well-written storylines that initially drew me - and presumably others - to this show, which now stumbles clumsily from one eye-roll-inducing scene to the next.The show seems to have become a really tragic hybrid between a bad episode of Law & Order and a day-time soap - if it wasn't for the fact that I've got cable and the other shows I enjoy watching are on hiatus until the fall, I wouldn't be giving this the time of day at all anymore. I keep hoping that it'll get better, but so far it's just one bad episode after the next."
"I watched an episode of this to see what it was all about. How in the world did this family get a reality show? and whats worse....is WHO would watch it.?? There are good shows with excellent writers, and it's hard to believe that our entertainment is going in this direction."
"When the savagely distasteful reviews for &#8216;Only God Forgives&#8217; dropped earlier this year, I was baffled.  I mean, &#8216;Drive&#8217; was pretty much critically applauded and continues to earn raves from cinephiles, and Ryan Gosling is kind of like beloved by nearly everyone (I said nearly), so how in the world could the much anticipated follow-up to their surprise masterpiece be such a terrible film?  I chucked it up people just not &#8216;getting it&#8217; and figured that they MUST be wrong.Nicolas Winding Refn couldn&#8217;t have dropped the ball THAT far, could he?You can go ahead and sound the alarm, because the world that hated &#8216;Only God Forgives&#8217; was correct and pretty much hit every nail on the head.  I&#8217;m just as baffled as the ten other people who have yet to see this (I&#8217;m always late to the party), but believe me, this film is atrocious in ways I can&#8217;t even put into words.  I&#8217;m almost loathe to admit that I liked anything about this movie (the cinematography is gorgeous, the costumes are divine and that score is Oscar worthy) simply because the overall product is so dreadful.I am an advocate for the whole mantra &#8216;less is more&#8217;.  I love a subtle and inviting flow to a film because that slow burn allows the characters and the plot to thrive, unravel and blossom.  &#8216;Drive&#8217; had that, despite what you may think.  I think that was a chief complaint from the movie going public, since they were anticipating another &#8216;Fast and the Furious&#8217; and wound up getting something much slower, deeper and darker.  When I read the countless reviews complaining that &#8216;Only God Forgives&#8217; was too slow, too vacant or too quiet I actually thought that the critics were experiences a bad case of memory loss.  Didn&#8217;t we go through this already two years ago?  Don&#8217;t you know that Refn&#8217;s films are NOT what they appear but so much more than they appear?Memory loss or not, those complaints are legit.That is my biggest issue with &#8216;Only God Forgives&#8217; and a chief complaint I had with another film I saw recently (&#8216;To the Wonder&#8217;).  In fact, I foolishly watched those films back to back and I felt like I was watching a double feature on absolutely nothing.  Where &#8216;Drive&#8217; developed not only an intricate plot but a protagonist who felt real and crushing, &#8216;Only God Forgives&#8217; forgets to develop much of anything.  Instead, we are given scattered characters who say very little and only know how to emote a singular expression (I&#8217;m still not sure what that expression is, although I strongly feel that it could be constipation) and then one broadly stroked caricature who has all the obvious clich&eacute;s of the &#8216;monster mom&#8217; and yet none of the grounding to make her feel real, believable or even remotely entertaining (I love you Kristen, but what are you doing here?).  The plot itself is another &#8216;shrug of the shoulders&#8217; as it fails to be interesting or gripping but instead serves as a blank canvas for the characters to inflict horrific bodily pain on others and for the effects department to produce large amounts of fake blood.Gosling plays a man named Julian, a drug-smuggler living in Bangkok.  The film&#8217;s opening sequences portray Julian&#8217;s unstable brother butchering a young prostitute and then being beaten to death by her father.  Julian&#8217;s unhinged mother shows up to bury her son and exact revenge on the men responsible for her son&#8217;s death, including a sadistic police officer.  Julian doesn&#8217;t want to get involved, but his mother is a whirlpool and he&#8217;s soon getting beaten up by the cop and avenging his mother.At least I think so.There are so many distasteful things about this movie, and so many lazy aspects.  I didn&#8217;t expect Refn to pen such a poorly constructed disaster, but his script is so bare and so unintelligent, and the barely there dialog doesn&#8217;t help any.  I think Gosling says about ten things, and he doesn&#8217;t wear any expression on his face but that of &#8216;deep concentration&#8217; (or constipation, as I mentioned already) and so you really get no handle on who this man is.  Many scenes in the film feel so unnecessary or not even that but more pointless or ridiculous (as in, they don&#8217;t belong).  The relationship between Julian and his mother is never fleshed out and so it winds up feeling put upon and laughable, especially when he subjects a prostitute to dinner with his tactless mother (seriously, remind me again why he wants her to meet his mother), bares up under his mother&#8217;s insults and then berates his date (at least he shifts his facial features long enough to scream), demanding she take off the dress he purchased for her.I don&#8217;t think I can count the amount of times I stared at the screen, completely lost as to why anything that was going on was going on because nothing really &#8216;was&#8217; going on.Much like &#8216;To the Wonder&#8217;, I&#8217;m left wondering if the bulk of this film is sitting on the cutting room floor somewhere, and if so, why didn&#8217;t someone take the editor out and shoot them?  I mean, this can&#8217;t be the film Refn intended to release, right?  Is this his idea of a joke?  Maybe he intended to create something so hideous and so nonsensical that it could only be considered genius, because there really is no other explanation for it.Guess what Nicolas; you&#8217;re plan didn&#8217;t work!"
"According to wikipedia dot org, it's a 2013 French-Danish co-production crime thriller film written and directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. It was shot in Bangkok, Thailand.According to indiewire dot com, director Refn confirmed the cost of this movie was a little bit more than $5 millions.The worst thing about this movie was all main characters were emotionless. They did not express any emotion with their faces and words at all. It's as if they had been wearing masks. For example, the main policeman, he brutally killed some bad guys but his face was like a stone from the beginning till the end of the film. He did not show any anger or hatred.On top of that, there were very few dialogues. This made the problem worse.It's almost like a silent movie. For the first 10 minutes, it held my attention by forcing me to guess what would come next. Then, it became boring and tiring because I had to constantly try to interpret what the director wanted to convey with his video. It did not connect with me. It did not stir up any emotion. I did not care what happened to all the people. What's the point of watching a movie without feeling anything? In this regard, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's an example of how to make a bad movie.There are so many illogical holes and too much violence that make it less entertaining. For example, the scene where the assassin fired his machine gun into the small restaurant where the 3 policemen were eating. The policemen flipped the wooden table they're eating at and used it as a shield. Miraculously, no bullets hit the table. Yeah!The violence was so over-the-top that it became sadistic. For instance, there was a scene where the policeman poked the eye of a bad guy with a pointed metal stick. He also thrust it into the guy's ear.Almost everything was in slow motion. Even the scene where the policeman chased the assassin was in slow motion. At first, this technique drew my attention. Then, it quickly became irritating.The hand-to-hand fighting scene between Ryan and the policeman was so childish it's laughable. Ryan was not suitable as an action actor.UPDATED Aug. 19, 2013According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this film:Release Date: July 19, 2013Domestic:  $765,400+ Foreign:  $8,977,609= Worldwide:  $9,743,009So, it's a big flop in North America. No, I CAN'T FORGIVE this movie.In short, it's a waste of time and money."
See I really liked and got the whole point of Drive. I really did enjoy the film this though on the other hand I hated with a passion which is the directors follow up film. Literally the movie makes no sense to me except that Gosling's brother gets killed by a crazy vigilante type cop because his brother is doing some very bad things ( oh ya and to mention everyone in this movie is not likeable and I could not stand any of them. They are all psychos and what not). So gosling takes it upon himself to seek out some revenge. I mean you can watch this movie but it is complete garbage but once again that is just one persons opinion. To me a very big disappointing movie because I wanted to like it but hated it instead.
"I know that I haven't seen Kristin Stewart in awhile, it would be better not to see her at all than to see her in such a dismal waste of time as this movie. This movie is unbelievably and unbearably bad. Even dirtier to see Ryan Gosling stoop so low , could they have needed money  that badly?"
"I have a first class TV and first class equipment, but when I ordered Grabbers, and tried to watch it, I was unable to do so because the quality was so poor, not to mention the acting and everything else.  After about 15 minutes I just had to click off.  I can't recommend this movie primarily because of the terrible quality of the picture.  I wonder if there's a way to get your money back from Amazon?"
"I thought I'd really enjoy this, but hardly made it through the pilot - even after three tries.  The acting was horrible and the storyline, boring.  I barely made it through the pilot, and it took three tries.  Reading the stellar reviews, I wanted to like this series.  Boring and bad."
i did not like the grouping of the actionated flick so that is why i am giving this season flick  a bad rating in review ...
I couldn't get through it...too slow and too dark (content)...didn't hold my attention! Might try it again later but not sure.
"The preview made me really want to watch this, but it did not make sense.  The acting was good, but the story dragged and was way too deep for my brain to comprehend, so I would give this movie a D- rating, don't waste 7 bucks for this one!"
"I cannot believe I watched it to the end. Every once in awhile I would think well, something should come now...but it never did. Horrible, Horrible movie."
"There's nothing at stake for any of the contestants, as they're all established professional chefs.  Because of that, the show is mega-boring.  With no real notoriety at stake, there's absolutely nothing to care about.  Avoid this show like the plague unless you need a cure for insomnia."
"Weak writing.  Which brings about weak acting.  I feel like if I could have written the script for this show, you're in trouble.  Not worth the money."
"Boo.Whenever I see ratings on films, I am interested mostly in two particular scenarios:  critics go all Gaga -- and that ain't the Lady -- over a film; or critics pan a film entirely.  Usually, if it is the former, it means that it is ""safe"" for the critics to like it; it is perhaps some family-friendly garbage that everyone should love, which means that it's probably not very interesting in any way.  Conversely, if it is the latter, it means that it is not ""safe"" for critics to like it, because perhaps, someone like Lindsay Lohan is starring; and hating Ms. Lohan is completely acceptable because she's the kicking girl du jour.  Hey, critics are Lemmings too, just like the American public.Well, in this case, the critics mostly got it right, but not because of Ms. Lohan.  No one here had anything to work with, including her.  This film is completely forced, in writing and in action.  Immediately, the opening scene is exceedingly painful to watch, as you see some 20-somethings act in the way that everyone expects 20-somethings to act; in other words, in unnatural ways.  Oh, and then it only gets worse in even more unnatural ways.I will admit, I didn't watch the entire film.  As a matter of fact, I turned it off after about 20 minutes.  None of the characters are sympathetic -- every film must have at least one character that you will root for, and here I see none -- so this film failed immediately in that department.  And I saw no reason to continue watching.What was the purpose of this film?  Well, you've got me; I have no clue.  I give a big pass on a film that never should have been made.  I am going zero stars today on the worst disaster of a film created in years."
"There are bad movies that make you angry. There are bad movies that make you laugh. And then... there are bad movies that make you feel a little depressed and icky, but mostly just bored.""The Canyons"" is the last kind -- a hollow low-budget melodrama that begins and ends with empty pretension. It has roughly the same kind of story (shallow rich people, sex, murder) that Bret Easton Ellis has been writing for the past several decades, centering on a rapidly deteriorating Lindsay Lohan and her smoker's croak.Rich brat/movie producer Christian (James Deen) is in a relationship with Tara (Lohan), an aging party-girl who desperately wants the financial security he gives her. Every night, Christian brings in other people (both male and female) to have sex with Tara while he watches, and sometimes they participate in group sex.Tara convinces Christian to cast struggling actor/bartender Ryan (Nolan Gerard Funk) in his latest schlock movie -- without mentioning that Ryan is her ex-boyfriend, and that she's having a secret affair with him. But Christian suspects what Tara and Ryan are up to -- and he sets out to destroy his rival in any way possible. Even murder.Even before it was made, ""The Canyons"" was overshadowed by the forces behind it -- it was written by Ellis, directed by Richard Schrade, and starred the perennial train-wreck Lindsay Lohan in her ""comeback."" What was more, the movie was funded by Kickstarter and distributed on VOD. This movie could have been on the vanguard of the new wave of entertainment production...... but to do that, it would have to be good. And it's not. Instead it feels like Ellis is running on empty, so he's regurgitating pallid knockoffs of the shocking, controversial kind of stories that he's written about in his books. It's like a Xerox of a Xerox of a Xerox, and it just leaves me wondering why he was so desperate to make this movie.Bless Richard Schrader, he's trying to do SOMETHING with this mess, but doesn't seem to know what. The plot aimlessly wanders around, following Tara and Christian in their little cat-and-mouse game, having awkwardly unsexy sex and boring us into a stupor with the stilted, hackneyed dialogue. As the final indignity, they try to throw ""twists"" into it, but they are either nonsensical or predictable.So it's a bad movie. But it's not the hilariously awful, awkward train-wreck that people wanted. It's too good to be hilarious like ""The Room,"" but too bad to be watchable.It's also kind of sad that the best performance (no double-entendre intended) comes from a porn actor. Actually, James Deen is really, really good as Christian -- a cold, dead-eyed sociopath who has wells of white-hot fury inside him. He loves no one, and sees everyone who isn't easily controllable (like Tara) as an obstacle.Sadly, Deen is the best actor here. Funk is painfully out of his depth here. And Lohan is effectively playing herself, though not very well -- an aging, damaged party girl who lives off the largesse of rich men because she couldn't cut it as an actress. You can practically see her crumbling away in front of your eyes, with her ravaged face and croaking voice. It adds a poignancy to her performance that her affected acting sadly can't supply.""The Canyons"" is a movie that feels like a halfhearted effort from everyone involved, except the scarily empty-eyed Deen. It's not bad enough to be entertaining, and too bad to be enjoyable."
"Once again, a real trouper like Lindsay Lohan can act, even if it is in dreck like this.  Believe it or not, as bad as this film was, it was Lohan that rose above the material.  I'm not a fan of hers, however, she does have talent.  Now if she could only get her stuff together and get a real part in a real movie."
"I don't comprehend the moral or the massage the producers were trying to send by making this movie. I also don't much understand the plot line really. Saying that it doesn't seem very entertaining to compensate for the lousy plot either so either way you're wasting your time.First of all, The actors are lame! Lindsey Lohan who's supposed to be the marketing ploy of this film is playing Tara a gold digger who exchanged her humble roots for a life of luxury even if it was costing her true happiness and safety. Supposedly, Tara is living with Christian a psychopathic maniac with mental problems we come to find out he has a shrink and a tendency to organize orgies at his apartment where he forces his Girlfriend Tara to participate in for the sake of his entertainment and then video tapes the sex sessions also for his pure entertainment. However, his odd behaviors and the fact that he's a controlling jerk didn't stop Tara from continuing her relationship with him after all he has money. Then enters Ryan Tara's ex boyfriend and her true love into the picture, now he is dating Christian's assistance and unbeknown to her or Christian these two ex love birds spark an affair in which Tara helps Ryan get the lead role for a small movie Christian is producing. Anyways, the whole movie is a cat/mouse chase between keeping the affair secret from Christian, Christian suspecting it, spying on Tara, trying to destroy Ryan, having sex with random strangers and eventually succeeding in his quest for destroying Ryan who is broke and living under the roof of his current girlfriend with barely any money and yet somehow manages to live a pretty well off lifestyle if you ask me.All these characters seem to think about is money and sex and I mean all of them without any exceptions. Ryan objects strongly to the way Tara is living her life by leeching off a rich boyfriend and being untrue to her real self all the while he's doing the same exact thing by living off his Gf's house. Tara has two guys being overly obsessed about her and is described as very beautiful however Lindsey Lohan due to years of alcohol and drug abuse has totally ruined her natural looks and in this movie looks a lot older than her 27 years. She has so much surgery done to her face as well she looks fake and in no way beautiful as the producers would want us to believe not in a way that would generate such attention anyways. She did seem comfortable playing her role but then again it wasn't a very good role if you ask me. Not one that I was impressed by, you don't want to be playing a man's sex toy for a comeback role. The writing was mediocre it's almost like the writers make fun of their own movie by having Lindsey Lohan tell the actor played by Ryan that him being in a small movie won't make a difference anyways and since it is a low budget film then what'd you know? Oh the irony!In the end I felt like this was a let's pass time by because we're bored movie rather than an actual let's make a movie we are passionate about movie. Also, in many ways I felt like the Christian character who's obsessed with orgies and sex as well as occasional murder is much like Christian Bale's character in American Psycho except this is the inferior version.Sorry Lindsey Lohan make next time you can pick a better role to play as your breakthrough role. This movie much like the writers have you mention will get you no where and maybe go slow on the Botox and add more emotions to your acting. You did seem bored."
"I've seen hardcore porno movies with FAR superior stories, characters, dialog, acting and directing than this POS.  This so-called movie fails on ALL accounts.  Hard to believe once-talented people like Ellis, Schrader and Lohan could make total crap like this.  A sad sad end to otherwise notable careers.  Avoid this miserable failure of a &#34;movie&#34; at all costs."
"I've been waiting a year to see this episode by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Dana Priest (and Jim Gilmore) about her year-long investigation into the new secret government infrastructure with all the gory details.  This revealed very little about that.  Only about 10% of the episode's time was devoted to where these sites are, how they are funded, how they work with local law enforcement, what they are doing, etc..  The vast majority of the time is spent rehashing the events that led up to this situation with all of the bureaucrats and government officers telling us how patriotic they are and why they were justified to take the gloves off and do anything they wanted beating us over the head with their rhetoric.  I suspect that Priest's story was compromised by the governmental players to water down the theme and impact this story deserves.  What a disappointment.  I suppose I will have to read Dana's book to get the full story.  Thanks for selling-out, Frontline."
"Was a good show before this season which is sinking quicker than a gold nugget in a fast moving river.  Just waiting for a decent episode, maybe 7?"
"As a black woman, I can't seem to remember my parents smiling, singing or dancing during Jim Crow. and I don't see myself buying this product. Sometimes I wish companies like Amazon would really think before they willingly pickup and sell some things. But this is America and Amazon has to find its own morals."
"This is exactly why we need to invest more in education.  We need fewer dumb people like this in America.  It makes us look, well dumb.  It is funny seeing stupid people do stupid things in excess but it's still dumb and I don't like our country being famous for it."
"This is a thinly scripted fake reality program about gold mining. The two lead characters are supposed failed real estate hustlers who are deep in debt and who are going to save themselves financially by mining gold in Africa. The show's speciality is fake peril. Lots of overly dramatic moments involving crime, dealing with criminals, fights and so on. With almost a two-person cast at a few locations, the show profits are probably good but they are constantly having to be very inventive to fill airtime. They manage to keep the program going (often in spite of itself) through sheer energy.The show isn't big on continuity. No mention of last seasons investor and get equipment magically back without paying bills owed. And once again, though mining in the bush, everyone is very, very clean. I hope they manage to do some competent mining at some point in this season. But I kind of doubt it.Those involved in the show deserve a degree of technical credit for being able to produce a watchable hourlong show like this with a primary cast of two. Everyone is very earnest even when talking nonsense. It not a good show, but everyone involved seems to be at least trying."
"I thought this show could be interesting, but the people in this show are largely empty, petty, and detached from reality.  If you like watching people obsessed with superficiality catering to overly-wealthy and often arrogant clients, go for it.  Otherwise, this is just another example of the cultural weakness our country too often places on a pedestal.Bickering, hungering for money, complaining about meaningless things--this flop of a show has it all.  Just a terrible way to waste your time.  Honestly, the show is just plain boring most of the time.  So you get annoyed by horrible people and bored to death when you are not.AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  A day on laxatives is more satisfying."
"I would have truly loved this if the background music/singing wasn't so loud and overwhelming and distracting. I think that the music was beautiful and I would have loved to have listened to it separately from this documentary, but paired so loudly with the show it was a nuisance. When there was no background music/singing I found this program very good."
This show was ok at one time. It was entertaining and the science is what sparked my attention. But there wasn't too much scientific evidence. I purchased more shows than I really should of but hey I was hoping for more proof of ghosts. Sometimes curiosity wins :)
"This was a poorly written waste of time.  I only watch a few minutes, hoping it would pick up but it never did.  There was no dialogue, no basic story line, just endless trips to the &#8220;potty.&#8221;  Bobs girl"
Way to weird  fit me. I have a difficult time with this type of film. I would not watch again.
i saw the &#34;f&#34; word was used liberally and i don't need any filthy words for entertainment. too bad hollywood hasn't grown up and cleaned up their vocabulary.
"This movie had an interesting beginning with the female character's behavior problems, but after about fifteen minutes of her doing nothing but going to the bathroom and eating take-out food, I lost interest and fell asleep."
"I do not know why some companies think their movies are worth outrageous prices just to rent them for a short period of time...If we look at this rental, the actual purchase price would be well $60 for the movie on DVD...Please price these movies appropriately...nobody wants to rent movies at prices which they might buy it instead..."
What a complete farce. A very dark cinema of murder and mayhem. It stops there!!I wasted my money and paid a premium to see it 'before it is in the theatres'I do not give this even a star. As  a matter of fact it rates a minus 5 for me
A show which can put you to sleep if you can.t sleep. Will keep trying but............we will see how it goes
"If you like to watch as this country goes down and down with psycho woman yelling and screaming at each other, and then becoming violent with throwing things or pushing each other as they MUST take center stage and out-do the other showing who has the LEAST amount of class and character, THEN THIS IS FOR YOU!If on the other hand, you try to make this world a better place and stand for something decent, and give your children something positive to look up to, then please.....PLEASE don't waste one second watching this program, as these woman show clearly what trash they are and offer nothing of substance what-so-ever, and especially not love for their kids. If they did love them, they'd have nothing to do with behaving like this and acting like the low class, uneducated, in your face media whores they are.I'm so sorry for the kids that have to live with them."
You just reminded me to cancel my instant video of this ridiculous show.  Sorry you couldn't find a better vehicle for Andre Braugher.
HIMYM should have ended their run around season 6. Once Marshall's dad died the season became too serious for it's own good and stopped being a comedy and tried to rely more heavily on the dramedy side of the show - they should have stuck to being more closely related to a sitcom than dramedy. It's a shame this show has been so disappointing because of the all-star cast at their disposal
"Another gang of crime fighters with lab equipment, only these folks are out in the desert. Is there no end to these pathetic shows about dumb a criminal being caught by five or six crime fighting lab techs. Unfortunately even their lab technique stinks.This program is so old and stale it is almost impossible to comment on."
"I was going to write a review on this show, really truly I was, but I fell asleep watching it........."
This I thought was a dumb movie but if you like gory it is here! The quality of the movie was poor so when I reported it to Amazon they refunded my $3.99. Amazon is so good about this! The movie is about this Psychologist that invites her so called friends over to her house for dinner and she took movies of everyone to see if they really knew each other as well as they thought they did. Surprise! They didn't!But as I said before I could not follow it as it kept stopping and starting. Didn't think I would ever make it to the end because of that. Perhaps you will have a better experience.
I tried to like it but this comedy is anything but funny.  I didn't even like the trailer but I happen to like everyone of the cast members.  I just don't understand why none of the cast members ever ad libbed something funny every so often.  It would have kept my interest.  I held out as long as I could but got to a point where I could no longer waste my time watching.
"NO SPOILERS:Within 30-seconds of watching, I actually started to contemplate which of the diminutive actors was taller.  Not a good sign for a situation comedy.The Cast:The Boys:Honestly, I have liked nothing that Seth Green has ever been in, sans when he played himself in ""Entourage"".  Giovanni Ribisi is likely wishing that he never cooperated with the criminal investigation in ""Boiler Room"". Peter Reigert was in ""Animal House"" in 1978 and ""Barbarians at the Gate"" in 1993.  He missed out on his goal of appearing in one potable program every 15-years by seemingly taking all of 2008 off.  The real shame is that I have always liked Martin Mull and hate to see his legacy tarnished by this ""dog with fleas""!The Girls:Brenda Song has matured nicely, though I have to believe that a ""Suite Life"" reunion show is beginning to look appealing.  I heard that she has Zack or is it Cody, on speed dial!  Vanessa Lachey temporarily stepped away from her stereotypical bringing life to an inanimate object hotness and was filmed wearing loose clothing and at odd angles (likely due to her pregnancy).With a Metacritics score of 15 (out of 100), this one appears to be dead chalk for first show to go."
"Yup. This sucks big ones as much as the commercials suggested. Please, please cancel this show. For every piece of crap that gets greenlit and put in front of us, there are nine, usually better shows that don't.We don't need crap like ""Dads"" (or ""Moms"" or ""Sean Saves The World"" or ""Welcome to the Family"") on our TVs. But it seems that's the way things are going, nowadays."
"Would I consider more shows?  HMMMMMMMMMMMMM let me see?  Ah yes, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!A tacky show and a waste of Seth Green's talents and as to the other guy- his best thing he ever was the reoccurring role as Phobe's step brother."
"I watched it because of Ribisi but it really is what it appears to be. A very cliche, descending trombone sound, lame and silly sitcom. The picture is an accurate depiction of the show. I haven't watched something like this since I was a little kid. Three's Company was better than this show.What is Ribisi thinking? He is a genius and he's doing this show?"
"It would be zero, but apparently you cant do that, so this gets a one star.  I honestly wanted to like this show, because it has a pretty funny cast, but this show is one of the worst things I have ever seen."
No subtitles in spanish and english. Because of that i only give one star. But the video are in HD.
"The Special Effects are like those of a B movie. I mean they look obviously fake.There is no suspense. The acting does not help the show either.There are multiple logical holes but I ignore them because it is a fantasy show.In short, it's not worth it."
"First off - you  pay for an episode and you get FOX ads - not a good thing.They kill off Clancy Brown in the first few minutes, than it goes into a wild truck versus guy scene with pretty over the top effects.It lacks writing, imagination, direction and acting. These people need to stick to video games!Sorry - but this series is a waste of time if you graduated kindergarten!"
Schmidt is disgusting. Jess is annoying. Nick is lame. No more new girl. Cancel it and mindy project too. Yuk.
"Nine Things about the Movie &#8220;Bad Milo&#8221; [USA, 2013]1. Netflix recommended this movie to me. It&#8217;s proof that they need to improve their suggestion algorithms.2. This movie is terrible. I even watched it drunk, and it didn&#8217;t help.3. The movie begins with a guy named Duncan. His doctor tells him, &#34;You've got a thing in your butt&#34;. He needs to find a way to keep his stress down, to keep the &#8220;thing&#8221; from growing bigger.4. Actually, Duncan has a monster in his butt. When he gets too stressed, the monster pops out of his butt and kills whatever is stressing Duncan out. Or whatever else it finds.5. Duncan teams up with a crackpot psychologist, who tells him the &#8220;myth of the anus&#8221;, and recommends that Duncan bond with the butt monster, which he names Milo. If Duncan kills Milo, Duncan will turn into a zombie.6. I think the movie is trying to be a metaphor for fatherhood, but it&#8217;s an epic fail. The plot makes no sense. The characters are random and full of stupid humor. The movie spends way too much time in bathrooms, and has too many pointless close-ups on Duncan&#8217;s demon-filled ass.7. The movie is obviously trying to become a &#8220;cult classic&#8221;. But the filmmakers don&#8217;t realize that you can&#8217;t try to attain that status. It happens naturally. Otherwise, it&#8217;s a pathetic waste of time - like this movie.8. I actually feel sorry for the actors. I don&#8217;t know what they could have been thinking when they agreed to make this movie. They need to keep this movie off their resumes.9. This movie fails on all fronts. It&#8217;s a comedy that isn&#8217;t funny, a monster movie that isn&#8217;t interesting, and a cult film that isn&#8217;t edgy. It&#8217;s boring and stupid and juvenile."
Loved the first four seasons cant stand season five. The actors seemed burned out on their roles. Not gonna watch more.
"Another sitcom which is , well just that another sitcom . None of the comedies ever change , just the times do . It's originality was lost in the meantime , however unnoticed it goes because that's the way the entertainment industry works , not so as real originality succeeds , just for the average regular citizen , that actually is more of a third party that rather exerts itself when needed . It reigns over culture without existing over it . Hence the entertainment industry gets off with it as a benefit without reprimand ."
"Warning! Even the slightest bit of sleepiness will be greatly exaggerated while watching this show. It doesn't just drag, it crawls. Uphill."
"Written on about the 6th grade level. Episodes are intellectually unchallenging and boringly predictive. Characters are shallow. Strategies are unbelievable and simplistic. Plots have no depth, e.g., good guys kill/capture bad guys.On the other hand, it's a cute child series that 4th to 6th graders can follow and have fun with on a boring Sunday afternoon, if there is a blizzard outside or a tornado. Otherwise they would probably be so bored they would go outside and watch the clouds, which would be more exciting."
this was so silly and predictable we quit watching it and are amazed anyone would like it...but we are adults
"So much has been said of this show already.  Let's get to the point:Half the cast is great.  Half the cast is too green, inexperienced, and frankly young.  No one will believe that SHIELD agents should look like the rejected cast of Friends.  The show makers do not take the organization seriously.  SHIELD, instead of being a hardened group of super agents, is a gaggle of barely legal noobs.The show burdens us with forced humor, corny dialogue, and uninteresting scenes.There are no superheroes or supervillains taken advantage of.  Instead of mining the rich depths of Marvel lore, they hand us a brainfart of a hero who jumps out of a burning building and SHOCKS everyone.  Shocks everyone!?!  Really!?!  In world where aliens just invaded!?!  Where a Norse GOD just said hello!?!  Where Iron Man flies around?  Where the INCREDIBLE HULK just saved everyone's lives!?!The atmosphere of the show is one akin to the old A-Team series.  Violence with no consequences.  Boring or lame characters introduced each show.  Obviously manufactured storylines.  There is no atmosphere of foreboding, mystery, awe, or fear.  Which, to me, seems integral to the success of a show trying to display mankind's reaction to the burgeoning supervillain-and-monster-infested reality we all find ourselves living in.What a flop.  Avoid at all costs.  It does not take the Marvel Universe seriously.  It adds nothing.  Instead of presenting SHIELD as an investigative, subterfuge-filled, espionage-oriented, and artifact retrieval unit struggling to even the odds for mankind, this show gives us a flaccid comedic parody of the deadly serious organization from the comics.Stan Lee help us."
"The original Ironside, Raymond Burr, gave you the feeling that even though he was cranky, he was still a good person.  I don't remember a lot of the plots from those days, but as background noise fodder it was decent and the cast was likeable.  They also went &#34;old school&#34; and seemed to have a pretty decent moral compass.The van, the barber chair, the love of chili, the interactions of the characters were good enough at the time to keep me entertained (I was a kid, didn't take a lot, sue me.)The whole stuck in the wheelchair thing got in the way of a good story a lot back in the day.Today's version, none of the characters to me were likeable (and granted I only watched about 2/3 of the original pilot), nothing to really latch onto emotionally and you were left with the feeling that this Ironside had no problem bending the rules and of course the plots generally twisted to provide a rationale for what was done.They also seemed hellbent on making the guy in the wheelchair some sort of ninja hero with mad skills that he still maintained.The stories? Didn't seem like they had a real handle on where they wanted to go.  Was this a straight up (well, sitting down) wheelchair driven cop show?  Murder mystery?  Certainly no comedic elements in what I saw.General lack of balance (serious vs comedy) no one to really root for, I turned it off and went back and rewatched Sherlock."
"Totally stupid show . Spencer is a talentless actor , Kinney has the acting ability and personality of a brick wall , the rest of the cast is wooden and as for the stories , oh yeah there are none . Brain dead series for a brain dead audience ."
"I loved this show when Bones was a strong woman scientist but as time has gone by, her professionalism has been reduced to an emotional flaw that must be guided by an emotionally superior man.  No longer enjoy watching this."
"Not my kind of film. Too gross, poor acting. I watched this movie for 10 minutes then called it quits."
"What happened to the alien at the end?Lot's of confusion and unresolved stuff.It could have been cleared up and had a point, but nothing here really.The ratings above 1 seem to be mercy ratings by people who know the cast & crew.Sorry, but this has nothing to recommend it."
"I.......................................  could have been an &#34;actor&#34;. darn............  I think maybe comparted to them , a method actor. TO think I watched a whole 4 mins."
"Do not waste your time.  Do not be fooled by the interesting looking creature on the cover of the DVD shown here.  That is about as interesting as this movie gets.  Acting is a joke, totally amateur, CGI crap that any Video Game can create, no story of interest, just move on."
"Acting was atrocious; I got the feeling the captain of the ship was trying to emulate Nathan Fillion's Mal from &#34;Firefly&#34; (2002-2003) & &#34;Serenity&#34; (2005) in style, but there was one huge difference - viewers cared about Mal, partially because of Fillion being a terrific actor, but also because Mal was an awesome character.  Like others have stated, there was no true plot here; the movie was 43 minutes long, and in my book that wasted 40 minutes of my time.  Thankfully I didn't waste any cash on this movie as it was a freebie from my Amazon Prime account.  The only &#34;actor&#34; I cared about at all, was the little CGI alien critter they nicknamed &#34;Rat.&#34;  He didn't have much screen time, but he was cute enough to dominate whatever shots he was in, sort of made me think of a miniature Dobby (Harry Potter series) with a tail.  Even he wasn't enough to redeem this wasted movie....."
"Let's scream and bicker and cuss and we can do another 100 more seasons . Loved the show from it's inception, but seasons kept getting more annoying as the writing was scrapped for hollering and shouting. They used to have clever endings and twists, like Seinfeld, but now Charlie or Dee seem to ruin whatever the story point was by acting uber-crazy in the end and scrwewing up the plot, that's a cop out. Come up with better ways to finish an episode gang. Perhaps 10 year olds will appreciate it?"
I enjoyed it till I figured out it was all faked.....the plot would be very interesting and compelling if it were true.  Money down the drain.
"A supposedly erotic fantasy about two foolish women and the moral vacuity that causes them to ruin their own lives, those of their sons, their sons' wives and their grandchildren. The conflict is specious, as is the situation itself. This is just more mommy porn. It has neither true conflict nor honesty."
"Some of the worst television ever produced; it isn't quite bad enough to be revolting, but it's close. The Blacklist tells the story of brave Federal agents stopping terrorists (usually violent domestic activists bent on killing people, unlike the real-life domestic activists who are mostly non-violent). The agents also spend time at a black ops site where there are no prisoners, no cages, and no torture, again unlike real black ops sites. Like children playing war, the agents race here and there defeating bad guys. It has lots of action and little reflection. So, it shouldn't be surprising that it is mainly based on empty stereotypes. The one bright spot is James Spader's character. He is the father of the female lead (though we haven't been told this yet) and he may, or may not, be an international terrorist. The mystery around this character, and Spader's acting, are compelling, but not enough to overcome the lack of development of the other characters, the silly writing, and the children's tale that is The Blacklist."
This series so far is nothing but exhibitions of gratuitous violence coupled with the machinations of an evil genius played by James Spader who week after week knows everything.  It all lacks any credibility.
Story line is slow developing and the use of period English slang makes some of the dialog difficult to follow. I gave up after the first episode.
"Clear their heart isn't in it. I feel bad. It used to be a show I loved to hate, then, it started to morph into something better. I feel bad for no longer liking it."
"I like this show.  My mom and I watch it.  Great singing and interesting stories.  But, it has started to get a bit, out of hand.  I mean, If I didn't know any better, I would aware that this episode was from 1990.  First, I mean, being afraid to be in an interracial couple.  Really?  Seemed so 20 years ago.  Then, when the guy went over to help the guy from getting beaten up.  How did those people low he was gay?  They said &#34;look another one.&#34;  I guess they just knew.  Plus, beating up someone because they are gay, again, really?  What is it 1980s Texas.  It is not even like they were beating up a kid.  It was a man.  Then and finally, the girl was talking to the guy saying &#34;were not in high school anymore.&#34;  I mean, what's it been 6 months since they graduated?  Maybe it has been longer.  They keep having the freaking people come back.  On top of all that, oh, sorry if I said that was the last thing, for a long time, none of the kids live like high school kids.  Drinking, smoking, sex and drugs.  It's like a 70s drive in movie.  It has just gotten so far from what the show started out as.  At least it seems that way to me.  But, I will watch until the end.  I have watched for years and am not one to give up."
I love Glee but this was the WORST EPISODE EVER! The entire 5th season is terrible with very few exceptions.
A very murky and convoluted show filled with things nothing but darkness.  Uh-huh.  I am done finished with this!!!!!!!! BYE
I put up with the ads hoping they would go away. They did't so I'm done with Fox shows until they are gone.
I like Michael J Fox but  the show's characters don't come across as appealing...characters need to develop depth  and pace needs to slow...less slapstick
"Not funny, witty, moving rather just the same old tired formula. Uninspired writing, dumb plot lines, totally predictable. More of MJF being himself without stupid family situations etc. would be great."
I don't know why this show is getting such good reviews it isn't even the slightest bit funny. And the characters are annoying and horrible at acting. like I said this series is just extremely overrated.
"TBBT is one of those shows that people do not stop talking about. After hearing all this great stuff, I thought I should jump in! On a day off, I caught a marathon on TBS. I watched about 4 episodes, didn't find them funny, so I decided it wasn't for me. Recently I won a season in my office's white elephant. I thought I would maybe give it another try, because maybe the episodes I saw where just from when the show was in a dry patch. I popped this disk in, I watched all 7 episodes on that disk, and I didn't laugh once. The problem I have with this show, is that it doesn't really make you think, unlike so many other shows out there such as Arrested Development, Parks and Rec, and Community you don't have to think. The jokes are simple and all the jokes are just 'stand-in jokes' and none of the jokes &#34;come out of the charecters.&#34; I know that was kind of hard to understand haha, but the charecters just don't really feel real., How they portray Asperger's is unbelievably off, they portray people with that disease to be self-centered and really not care for anyone. I have a very close family member that has that disease and he is very kind and not as extreme as that character is. If you wanna see a good portrayal of that disease watch Parenthood or Community.  and how &#34;geeky&#34; they are. The overwhelmingly loud laugh track ruins the show, and the acting is just awful. I know some of you probably disagree with me, and that's OK. This is just my opinion."
I hear everyone says this show is the best show ever. Sorry but that belongs too the wire which is the greatest show ever made. It had more drama than this. The whole alien thing creeped me out as well. Guess nothing can compare too the wire....
"Oh, NBC... Why don't you ever learn? Who in the world working there is permanently stuck in 1997? What makes them think ANYONE wants to watch crap like this??? Okay, sure. I'm sure some people out there loved the late 90's and its cliched sitcoms.Hell, CBS has an entire block of terrible, outdated sitcoms. ""Two and a Half Men,"" to ""The Big Bang Theory."" Crappy, terrible Chuck Lorre shows that only appeal to the lowest common denominator of ""comedy."" This is what NBC hopes to duplicate for some unknown reason, but they always fail miserably. Especially when they put out crap like this, ""Welcome to the Family,"" and ""Ironside."" Remember last year's ""The New Normal"" and ""Animal Practice?"" Or cringe-worthy ""Whitney?""Okay, what can I say about this show? It IS cringe worthy, it's lame, it's cheap, it's cliche, it's predictable, it's horribly pandering (to middle class liberals, the LGBT community, etc.), and it just basically sucks.There are only two other reviews on this show at the time of writing this. If I can save one person from watching crap like this, it'll be worth it.Maybe if you're over 45 and long for the cheesy sitcoms of the mid to late 90's, you'll enjoy this. That aside, its still a terrible show.Then again, what isn't on NBC, nowadays?"
"I have loved this series...BUT I'm getting really tired of dobblegangers and 2 Elaina's and now 2 Stefan's...  I'm tired of this Silas storyline and I'm getting ready to jump ship, but I keep hoping for a GREAT story to begin and grab ahold of me!  Sometimes the writers really drag out these stories just way too long!!  Let's move on from dobblegangers...please!!"
The vampire diaries is one of the worst television shows ever made. Don't waste your money on this crappy tv show.
"I am done with this show. The first episode of this season is too much. I heard it was violent, and some people complained. I was like yea... whatever.I got to the part where it happens. The last 10% of the show. I stopped watching. This is in horrible taste, and piss poor timing. I am done with a series that panders extreme violence for ratings. I am done with Sons. I won't be watching the rest of the season, or any future season.I saw enough of this crap in the news, and in my time in Iraq. The last thing I want to see is something like this spun out just for for higher ratings. As far as I can tell, it serves no purpose to the story.Considering I would give previous seasons all 5 stars, to give this 1 star on the first episode. That is how totally wrong this is."
"$3 an episode in HD and I have to watch commercials!? WTH, Amazon. You need to amend your licensing agreement with FX and fix this nonsense with a quickness. It's a total rip-off and detrimental to both of your brands."
"The point of this series escapes me. All the characters live in a moral cesspool of broken promises and self-delusions. It's anthemic puppetry at its worst, with a cast of low characters who hold onto codes unfit for a colony of rats scurrying about on a sinking ship. Any tether to &#34;Hamlet&#34; is castrated by respective beliefs systems that are impossible to fathom. The only character that emerges with a wit of self-awareness is Jax's former girlfriend. I must be mental for watching the first five seasons to arrive upon this conclusion."
"Until season 5 this show was ok, after that it became a broken record. Unless you get absorbed into the characters themselves the plot is pretty crappy."
"This show had a lot of good ideas, but it's spoiled by poor writing, continuity errors, sloppy plotting, and they've got way too much machina in their deus. There's also way too much boy band drama, especially now that Sam and Dean are in their thirties. It's too bad really, because it's been a long time since we had a good spooky TV show."
"I don't know, it was sort of stupid and maybe just to contrived for me. There are too many better shows to watch."
"Poor plot, poor acting, and the script was awful--unless you are a teenager...you probably won't enjoy this this show!  Just watch 1 episode and you'll see."
"Couldn't get past the obnoxious sitcom audience laughter. I mean, they pushed the button for ""laugh"" EVERY time someone said something.....Corny as hell. Still an Anna Faris fan though, but this show is some bulls***"
...not for adults. Boring. There's not much else one can say about this series. Why should creatures who live for hundreds of years still be trying to work out adolescent angst? I don't care enough to watch and see if this question can be answered.
"Yeah, we celebrate holidays you make up on the fly. There are actual holidays you could use. You don't have to make stuff up."
"I just saw the premier episode last Thursday and it was horrible. terrible acting, terrible script, and the characters were just extremely annoying."
"Why are all vampire shows so serious and solemn all the time? After the twilight movies &  True Blood haven't we had enough brooding vampires, fighting with witches, or werewolves? I couldn't even watch the whole first episode because I felt like I'd already seen it!"
"I had high expectations for this series.However,  the first season episodes consistently fail to live up to their  potential.This is due in no small part to the awkward scripts.  There is very little substance here and far too much ""pouting""  and cartoonish posturing.Claire Holt is particularly annoying. She does not have the experience to overcome the infantile scripts. she does little more than pout her way through every scene. Holt does not know the difference between ""sexy look"" and ""constipated"".  She is consistently upstaged by any other female she shares a scene with."
Waste of MONEY! The first episode was already shot and story was already given in the show Vampire Diaries. Why would anyone be interested in a family of egocentric characters that no one really likes? The acting is very good but the characters are 2-dimentional and uninteresting.
"Ok, so someone has read Anne Rice. This is good. There was potential here to create something interesting and provocative.But no.Where do these writers come from and how old are they? And who is directing?That is what is truly scary about this.A few pretty faces but you really need to be a 15 year old who thinks the Twilight series is good literature.If you are - you will love this.If not, more than 20 minutes is painful."
"This show has had a few really funny segments but this season (3) I fast forwarded through a lot..too much crude language, sex, etc. You don't need all that when you are truly funny."
Not a story line I can follow. I wish I could have my time back after watching this the program.
"Great start, but once again, the second episode is available only as SD.  For those of us who watch this in HD, I guess we will have to wait a few more days.  I have no idea why there are delays with some TV shows to get the latest episode."
I was charged for 3 zero number episodes for Season 4 of which I have only seen 8.A preview or whatever you want to call it I did not order and should not have been charged for ever.Very unhappy
"If you want to watch a bunch of idiots, who are too stupid to do anything to even really try to stay alive, then this is the show for you.  They have been living in this prison for almost a year now but have done almost nothing to improve thier position.  I would have raided every home improvement center for a hundrend miles and been pouring concrete by now.  Not to mention hauling in wind, solar and regular gas generators for power.  Simple steps.Speaking of raiding, You are driving around in the zombie apocolypse and you consistantly choose the small, hatchback hybrids?  Seriously?  I would be driving one of the hundreds of military Humvees, which have been sitting EVERYWHERE or, better yet, a good old Army 2 1/2 ton truck with a White multifuel engine.  Those things run forever, you can add armor, or, in this case, simple &#34;keep the zombies off protection,&#34; and the engince will burn anything flamable, even vegetable oil.  Plus they haul more than 2 tons of supplies and they sit up higher than a zombie can reach and can easily run over a whole pack of the things.Instead, these guys keep picking the cheasiest &#34;whimpmobile&#34; that they can find.After all this time, they still have not worked out a decent method for clearing a building or any other basic tactics.  Whenever they get new people in, instead of training them up to be a part of the team, they seem to try to ostricize them and then wonder why they have problems?  Plus, after living in this prison for a year, they have not even bothered to pick up any of the trash and then wonder why they have a outbreak of disease?  Wow, didn't see that one coming!A friend said that all of this is to ensure they &#34;have challenges each week.&#34;  Personally, I would rather see the &#34;challenges&#34; shich come from rebuilding and clearing out the zombies.  Restarting some kind of civilization and making things work again.  Not the ones which come because of the boneheaded things they keep doing.  I cancelled my TV Pass."
"Dont waste your money on season 4, wait for it to come out on Netflix so you can watch it for free. The entire season was blahhhhhh and the finale was even more blahhhhhhh"
"I've now begun rooting for the zombies, the story is so linear and dull that it has now been scratched off the list of shows to watch."
if your farm was being over run by zombies- wouldn't you just use the dozer to dig a mote around it?better yet... wouldn't you just go to the city center and dig a huge hole- put a few cows in it and wait for all the zombies to fall into it- then just light it up? or- wouldn't you make way to the coast- jump on a 35' yacht and head to an indo-pacific island that's untouched by the virus? or just live  on a 50' yacht in the water where you'd never have to worry about a zombie sneaking up on you?the writers skip over the most sensible and logical ways to regain control of a zombie infested world.very weak story line- poor character development- silly premise after silly premise... just one big FAIL.
"If this is the &#34;new&#34; way of conducting business, tell Jeff B I won't be ordering any more complete seasons. I have ordered several seasons of various TV series and was never charged for the promos. You charged me the same price for a 2 minute promo that a whole episode costs. BS"
"(Spoiler alert)When Rick and the Governor were locked in a final tussle, they were (unknown to the characters) battling for the entertainment value of the series. If one lives, the series stays awake, as it had been for two great episodes. If the other lives, it goes back to sleep. The trusty Gov' had already beheaded the second-most annoying character in our cast; now he was on the verge of truly freeing us from earnest tragic overload...But they KILLED him off. When it began, ""Walking Dead"" was great fun, because it reveled in the things that a good horror story can do. The guy trapped under the tank surrounded by zombies was just what we want with our popcorn. But it slowly morphed into this preachy tale of whining, goody-goody characters who are always worried about morality. These solemn, sermonizing bores. Horror is supposed to set us free, by loosing our demons. We want mayhem. We want people to do the wrong things for the wrong reasons. We want the savage battle of the instinctual. Let's face it, normal life is so stifling; we civilized folks have to hide our inner thoughts and desires, but in good horror stories they are given free rein and we can relax and laugh at how awful we just might be. The Governor was the only character who made this series feel alive. When he came back on the scene, we were enthralled, because we never know what he will do next - but we know it will be ruthless, amoral, and will serve his compulsion to defend HIS people against anyone else's people.So they kill him off, apparently because ""right"" must win. He should have mowed down the whole tiresome Rick community, taken over the prison, and then eventually been annihilated by some bigger force -- either a more powerful ""Governor"" type or a plague of zombies. He can die in the end (like Mr. Hyde, like the werewolf in so many movies, like Dracula) but WHEN he dies, that has to be it. That's a wrap. Curtains. Instead we have the always sad, solemn, struggling, pathetic, moral, but above all boring Rick leading us into ever more maudlin pathways.The premise of the walking dead, after all, is preposterous. That brain tissue in this kind of dilapidated state, let alone starved for any nourishment, could animate a human body is beyond silly. And that's fine, that's what makes it okay to let our demons romp. But to try to stitch a serious story to such a premise is really inept. You can't have people agonizing over fine moral dilemmas and then going down to the fence to stab rotting heads with sticks. Please, writers, get it together. The premise just won't bear this pretentious level of drama. You have to keep a certain tongue in cheek.If I want Kumbaya, agonized soul-searching, or a pep talk for the United nations, I'll watch a documentary or a drama. But this is horror. This is sacred fictional ground. We have to giggle as we scream. And you guys have muffed it badly."
Dear Amazon Digital Services....i just got billed for this video even though I had bought the pas for this entire season of Walking Dead.  Do you LIKE double-billing people?
"So I see that viewers will lower their standards right along with the show so there is no reason for it to improve. There is no reason to think up some truly interesting characters if people will settle for Governor No-Chin or Carol as someone to focus on. I gave the writers this season a chance and am actually surprised that this season is worse.I don't expect anyone to have the guts to change the title of the show since this is no longer The Walking Dead. This is just some very low-budget bore-fest using the name. The guy who created the show had guts but he apparently was the only one. Now on screen it's just a creep moping around in slow motion talking slow and oh look, now he is killing everyone and he's going to be the Governor again. Pitiful. No new ideas at all....even with all that potential. A sickness at the prison? Wow. What does it matter when there is no longer any clear reasons to live accept, like the zombies, to just keep on going? I guess the character of Carol was supposed to really embody that? Yawn.They are probably still at the prison just because of the budget but then why spend more money when people will love it whether they provide the epic-ness of a cop riding into a city experiencing the ""zombie apocalypse"" on a horse or whether it's a bunch of nobodies hanging out in trailers getting picked off by the psycho? Whether it's a dynamic as hell character like Shane or whether it's some pouty-faced manchild obsessed with commandeering a family. Who cares? Besides all that, if it is all about misery and degeneration then why bother? What is the point?I don't know what is worse though. The show that thinks the Governor is lead character material or reading all of these reviews of people talking themselves into thinking the show is great or those who feel that they need to respond to bad reviews and defend this mediocrity."
"The show is what it is, no comment on that. I enjoy it, and will keep watching it.HOWEVER, this past episode (season 4, episode 10) Amazon introduced an ad. A little itty bitty one, for another video series. But it was enough. I pay for these, so I don't get advertised to. I will not continue buying them if they have ads in them. Period. I sent feedback. I hope others do too, to discourage what is beginning, and will certainly only become a trend and get worse. (You will eventually see product ads if we tolerate this)."
"I absolutely LOVED the first season and a half of this series.The direction of the Series changed radically in the last half of the Second Season.Fans of the show will be VERY disappointed in the third season.By the third season, the writers appeared to have run out of any new ideas. Beloved characters were allowed to flounder around without anything meaningful to do. The George Tucker and Lemon Breeland characters were especially wasted in the third season.I am surprised the show is still on the air"
"I've purchased the first couple episodes, but, there is no &#34;up&#34; in this show like there is in Pretty Little Liars. While taken from the same book series, this one is just gloomy, without interesting characters to perk it up. Heck, not even fun to just look at the ridiculous clothes like on Pretty Little Liars. I'll be waiting for the Netflix version."
It is not the same without  -A and the pretty girls. I got bored with episode one. Should I give it more of a chance?
"First of all - why? Second of all - if anyone likes Pretty Little Liars simple because its so cheesy and the girls dress well, then you will not be able to stomach Ravenswood.  PLL was great its first season, but then the plot lines just kept getting dopier and dopier and finally my friend and I just gave up.  Well, we both realized that sense we're adults, it was just hard to keep watching because it was getting so ridiculously stupid.  But then with the Halloween special I thought: Okay - maybe they will wrap up some of these plot lines that have gone nowhere for five seasons.  The Halloween show was their attempt to introduce Ravenswood.  Basically Hannah's boyfriend Caleb came to &#34;rescue&#34; her from Ravenswood and he meets some other chic on the bus who is all &#34;i'm cute and in distress,&#34; and then Hannah is like, &#34;Oh i love you Caleb, so please stay in Ravenswood and help this other girl.&#34; WTF???? It's just so convoluted and completely unbelievable.  And then Ravenswood turns out to be this place with all these secrets but no one cares!"
Im not at all impressed with this seris. I have watched 2 episodes and that was enough. Its just not  interesting i love Pretty Little Liars but RW is not adventerous or even interesting its almost like everything is forced and the acting is forced also bottom line Caleb needs to leave  Ravenwood!
"The writing on this show has always been terrible, but after catching a few episodes of this show, I now know that an ape must have written this show."
"This show is simply a copy of the &#34;Chopped&#34; series format. It does not have the judge panel, kitchen set-up or drama intensity that is a hallmark of Chopped. It was hard for me, as a Chopped fan, to give even on star to Chef Wanted."
"Awful is the only good word to describe it. There is nothing good about the movie. Acting was all right, but the story, the way the movie was executed from plot, actors all are just plain bad. I don't remember seeing a 'monster'; ghost or whatever bad thing there was. I had to fast forward quite a few scenes to get to the part where we see pictures of what supposed to kill those guys in the end end endless running in the forest with grass, trees in the movie, everything but the ghost or the creature that was hunting them. Can't recommend something hat boring and that awful."
"MY TITLE SUMS UP THIS MOVIE TO A TEE. The story is about a couple (an American guy and a British girlfriend) who invite a male cousin (wink...wink) of the girlfriend on a camping trip in the Engish woods that are inhabited by witches. The Yank has his camcorder on at all times and is annoying his girlfriend to no end. Hence the found footage formate and the way this story is presented. For a found footage film it didn't make me sea sick with the shakey cam work like most seem to do and some of the steady cam shots of the landscape were nicely shot.There is tension between the two guy's for obvious reasons and makes you wonder what was the girl thinking. For me that was the most intriguing part of the whole story because the rest consisted of some conversations between the three,a road trip, a visit to a pub for a background on the story from the locals point of view, a hike to the woods with cows, sheep and horses, the camp site, more conversation, a chase, camp again, another chase, camp yet again and the the last chase THE END.There is some violence and little blood, very little suspense or tension, a make out scene that turns ugly and some foul language with no nudity.THIS IS AN IDEAL MOVIE FOR KIDS TO WATCH,  WHO YOU CAN'T SEEM TO GET TO FALL ASLEEP NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TRIED. It is so boring that I bet it works better than Ambien or Lunesta for sleep disorders. -5 stars"
I enjoyed the relationship between Castle & Beckett. I really enjoyed the show where Castle's father showed up. The show where Ryan and his wife was also very good.
THIS EPISODE WAS SO BORING I CLEANED HOUSE WITH IT ON IN THE BACKGROUND! THEY ARE RUINING MY FAVORITE SHOW WITH THIS D.C CRAP. AND WHY DO THEY THING CASTLE OR BECKETT HAVE TO BE ON DEATHS DOOR IN EVERY EPISODE NOW? WHERE ARE THE LAUGHS? AND WHERE THE HECK ARE RYAN AND ESPO!???
"There is nothing left of the old Grey's. The format, the questionable writing, the inane characters have all made it a caricarture of its former self. Sorry to see Christina Yang go out after the worst season. Earlier seasons are still worth binge-watching. I watched all years last fall Before this season started. I am finishing the year to see how Christina's departure is written but it is painful and annoying to watch. I didn't think it could ever be as bad as the ""operatic episode"" where certain characters sang their parts but little did I know.....Episodes 20 and later are showing hints of the old show but it's too little too late. R.I.P. Grey's Anatomy."
I RENTED A FEW EPISODES AND WAS BILLED FOR THE ENTIRE SEASON WHICH I WATCHED ON HULU !  WHY IS AMAZON NOT TAKING CARE OF THERE CUSTOMERS ANYMORE?????? I SURE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY THEY STIPPED CARING!
"If you love soap operas, I will not lie, THIS is for you.  What started as an admirable and cute medical drama series has devolved into the medical 90210 of recent years.  It really is a vomit-inducing show now that grasps for highs and lows with poor writing and uninteresting scenarios.  If you need a good eye-rolling workout, watch it.  If not, avoid.Some shows just get boring.  This is one of those.  They go on too long and lose that spark that they held in the beginning.  Their writers run out of decent ideas and characters to have sex with each other and believable plot twists, yet go on and on simply to keep collecting paychecks.  Like ladies of the night who have no education, they keep pumping out episodes, praying to the gods for gold.  Instead, they just muddy up our airwaves and cable boxes with diseased, hackneyed, and unwanted melodrama.  This show has become a tumor on the collective television body of entertainment.AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
"Note: I saw up the first four or five episodes of this show via XFinity On Demand in HD.After a suspenseful, shocking, exciting, harrowing and quite literally edge-of-your-seat season finale, I had high hopes for Season III. But they were dashed by spoilers on Facebook ruining the first few episodes with 'spoiler-free' teasers, and a shocking bit of switchhitting that occured towards the end of the fourth or fifth episode. Right then and there, I decided to stop viewing the show.Previously, the switchhitting had only been implied through discreet camera angles or a quick cut to another scene, but this was the first time anything like that had been openly shown on camera, and I was horribly disappointed.ABC, you screwed up big-time. Shame on you not only for openly allowing this filth to be shown on screen, but also in letting Mike Kelley go. I doubt he'd approve of the way you've let his show go down the drain into muck."
"I saw the trailer for this flick months ago and it made me want to see more. I wanted to love it, but the plot and poor acting made it almost unbearable to sit through. I applaud the fil makers for their work although I still believe Disney is behind the movie somehow. You'll actually see very little Disney products.  Instead you'll see poorly made green screen backgrounds oft he parks. I'd save your money and spend it elsewhere."
"The best part of this robotically acted, go nowhere storyline was the use of black & white filming. (That's suppose to be a funny.)Of all the ways to juxtapose going to Disney when you're a kid and then again as an adult w/kids this was not well executed. For some reason Dad is just as interested in gawking at two 14 year old girls (who tease him on) and who seem to always show up in the scenes (on rides, standing in line, eating, etc.) and was tediously boring."
"I really wanted to like this movie.  In fact the music and black and white film aspects were the only things I liked about this movie.  The acting, story and film work were terrible.  I really did not get it.  Please save your time and money on this movie!"
Not as good as I had hoped.  Seems to have lost its appeal to me.  The only thing that I like in it is that Kat and her boss are a good fit.
"I don't know why this show is popular,  it's not good. I thought it would be like Merlin from BBC, but it's not. It's about teenagers. It's way too shallow for me."
"I was very much looking forward to this show!After 'The Tudors', 'The Borgia's', and so many other excellent historical shows"
"Instead of the three words best man down, that's three words that better explain this movie. I barely got past a bloated Shelley Long and awful-facial-haired Justin Long before we got a priest in bed with a man. Ooooh, SO shocking. Yawn."
"Dario Argento takes a dump on Bram Stoker's classic story with this amateurish, cheap and dull production of Dracula.  Argento has never been known for thought-provoking cinema, and more often than not his stories feature an abundance of style over substance.  Here, even the style comes off as schlocky and cheesy, and not in a &#34;so bad it's good&#34; way either.  The entire cast doesn't speak English as a first language, and it shows in their performances.  With few exceptions, they all come off as stiff and wooden, with lifeless line readings.  Even Rutger Hauer, who has given some terrific performances in his career, is on auto-pilot here.  The only actor in the entire cast who really looks like he's enjoying himself is Thomas Kretschmann, who plays the titular Count.  And at times, it looks and sounds like he's doing his best Bela Lugosi impression.  Moving on, as this is a horror movie from Argento, it can be expected that there is a certain amount of blood and gore (along with some amusing female nudity).  While it certainly delivers in that department, the effects still look cheap and fake.  Also worth mentioning for how bad it is, the whole production has the look and feel of a made-for-TV drama, in everything from the staging and camerawork to the image quality.  A lot of the sets look like sets, and the CGI background enhancements in some scenes is jarring.  The visual effects are also disappointingly bad.  I already mentioned the blood and gore, but there's also a poorly done effect of bodies turning to ash as well as a laughably bad (but incredibly short) scene where Dracula attacks someone in the form of a (CGI) praying mantis(!).  On that note, in this movie Dracula doesn't just take the form of a bat, but also flies, roaches, wolves(?) and the aforementioned praying mantis.  Finally, even though I saw this in 2D, it was actually made for (and shot in) 3D.  Other than being a marketing gimmick, I can't possibly see how it would have benefited this piece of tripe.  Overall, it's best just to avoid this &#34;so bad it's horrible&#34; movie.  There are much better camp classics, and/or Dario Argento films if you're so inclined."
"Look, I totally get that Dario Argento has a devoted fan-base and so I am not writing this review to insult either the director or his followers but rather for unwary horror fans (like me) that might be confused by so many glowing reviews found on this page.""Argento's Dracula"" really kept me guessing on just how to view it; i.e. is it trying to be legit horror or campy, shoestring budget, fictional cloning that includes some soft-porn?  If it's trying to be legitimate horror, then consider the following:  Many of us have likely witnessed finer, acting performances at a local, high school play...  in fact it may be an insult to high schools all over America to compare the two.  Additionally, you've probably seen better quality costumes and wigs on display at informal Halloween parties over the years; and if said party had generic, scary music playing in the background then it was decidedly preferable to the scoring for this flick.  Furthermore if you've ever been completely engrossed in your work at any time and someone innocently walked up from behind and tapped you on the shoulder, thus scaring you, said encounter would represent a substantially greater fear factor than this movie possesses, whereas If you remember playing video games in the 90's and were enthralled by the cut-scenes then you will have witnessed infinitely better CGI.  And finally, if you've ever been privy to a sixth-grade book report on Bram Stoker's Dracula then you would inevitably find a more professional script than can be found in this film.I felt really bad for Rutger Hauer (Van Helsing) who seems like he accidentally wandered onto the set from the local rest home, Thomsas Kretschmann (Dracula... no I mean he's Dracula) does a really lousy Gary Oldman impersonation and Asia Argento (the chick on the cover) is just straight-up embarrassing to watch.  In all fairness, I have seen worse horror films (""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" & ""Manos, Hands of Fate"" come to mind) however I absolutely would not recommend spending actual money on watching this cheese-festival (lucky for me it was on Netflix) cuz it sucks really, really bad.  :o)"
This show has really gone down hill fast. The storyline is getting ridiculous and convoluted. This is not the type of series that lends itself to long seasonal and mid-seasonal breaks because people forget what is going on and give up trying to follow it.  I am guessing that this will be the final season - at least it will be for me.
You have to be an expert on Versace and his life to get where this movie starts and goes.  It is lame excerpt for Gina Gershon's portrayal of Donatella she does a superrb job otherwise this thing is unwatchable even for a Lifetime movie.
"I suppose this intends to be a celebration of the art of design.  I found it awful in every sense.  The ego dripping off of 'the star' revolted me. Even though I am anything but sympathetic to the elite class who get to parade around in the fashion world, I can usually find some way to relate because there is genuine art involved in the best fashion.  Do not waste a minute of your time on this narcissistic drivel."
"I can't believe how gullible people are! Do you really believe Theresa &#34;talks to dead people&#34;? Read up on the tricks of mediums. Number one is always that they ask a leading question and they only address people in questions, forcing the person to divulge information. (Watch for this next time?: &#34;Did someone here lose a parent recently?&#34; If she's talking to middle-aged folks, of course they're likely to have lost a parent by that age.  &#34;I see blood. Was there a tragic accident?&#34; Well, duh!)Also, don't you think the backgrounds of the people who appear on this show are fully investigated before an episode is filmed? Of course they are! Everything is prepared for. A production company doesn't just show up with seven people and start filming randomly. There's a story behind each dead person and of course that's been researched before Theresa even appears on the scene. And, believe it or not, she is briefed.For instance, I was watching the show in which Theresa is woken in the night and &#34;spoken to&#34; by a little girl in a hotel. In the morning, at checkout, Theresa mentions it to the desk attendant and Theresa seems blown away when the clerk tells her of a girl who died in the hotel many years ago.  I said to my son, &#34;I'd bet $1,000 that the death of that girl is well known in that area.&#34; One simple Google search later and sure enough, the hotel is thought to be haunted by the girl's ghost.And have you noticed what the &#34;dead person&#34;/Theresa says is exactly what the living want to hear?: &#34;Your father says he forgives you.&#34; &#34;Your husband says to go on with your life.&#34; &#34;Your mother tells you she is finally at peace.&#34; Come on now!!! Why is it never, &#34;Your father still blames you for his death&#34; or &#34;Your mother thinks that you should leave your husband because he's no good.&#34; If Theresa, oh, sorry, the dead people, were to tell the living they are still suffering on the other side or still hold someone to blame or whatever, Theresa would be out of business. And what a business she has!If you people believe this stuff is random, I've got some oceanfront property in Death Valley I'd like to sell you. Theresa's pretty convincing, I have to say that. Not everyone could pull off such a stunt, but--news flash--it's all hooey."
"I don't know what &#34;Juliette&#34; did to be cast in that role, but she's an awful actress. After watching all the seasons so far, I've come to the conclusion that her best acting is done when she's pretending to be in a coma. Aside from that, she manages little more than a furrowed brow and slightly widened eyes even when she should be acting terribly upset. She's also just had too much cosmetic surgery. The nose job is too pinched, the cheek implants don't fit her face, the dye job on her hair is too burgundy, and the botoxed upper lip fails to look attractive in any way. She sort of reminds me of the Bride of Frankenstein -- just too many parts put together to make an unattractive whole. I feel bad for the woman but she's just not an actress. She should go into some line of work where she can do well instead of trying to act."
"While it's true the show is about monsters and the ensuing violence this season was too over the top with dismemberment, gutting, and basically all around desecrating a corpse for a ritual. It taints the show and makes me really not want to watch it anymore."
"It's a struggle to watch this season of Grimm. I had my doubts towards the end of season 2, and now it's just stupid. I wish I had paid for this one episode at a time."
"I wanted to love it, but it was bad. It focused too much on the stereotypical &#34;nerd&#34; problems gone awry. I hoped for better."
I could not finish watching this movie. It started out good but lost its focus. All I can say is never trust anything that claim it will grant you 3 wishes. Not my kind of movie.
"Video; acting; storyline; script all of  a quality of a high school film class student production. Just goes to show that anyone with $500 for an HD camera can produce a waste of time video. No humor unless, again high school crude was the high light of your education; no story other than three weeks (boringly noted with day 1. day 2, etc. superimposed) of a few people in a house just drinking, talking and acting stupid. The only ghostly thing was the usual door opening/closing and a bed sheet raising (someone was under it and it was suppose to be a ghost) - that's it.All the five stars are probably connected to the video."
"I like Jonathan Rhys Myers who has performed in a number of roles, most notably Henry VII demonstrating his range of skills.  This role I did not like and the story line was not unique enough given all the other vampire movies out lately to be worth seeing the whole movie through.  I turned it off half way though which I don't do usually unless the story line is boring or not worthy of my attention.I would only recommend this to folks who can't  get enough  vampire movies.Deena"
"Note: I saw the pilot episode of the show via XFinity On Demand.Having seen the 1931, 1958, 1979, and 1992 versions of Dracula by Bram Stoker (and not in that specific order), I decided to give the pilot of this series a bite. The trailers looked enticing, and Jonathan Rhys-Myers does a very convincing American accent.Instead of being satisfied with the blood, I was confused, and felt like Lestat when he drinks the blood of two dead boys in Interview With The Vampire. The plot bears hardly any resemblance to the novel, and it's more like a sexed-up, stripped-down version of the novel. And while the 1931, 1979 & 1958 versions aren't exactly close to the book either, they're at least more watchable than this tired mess of rotting flesh. The definitive Dracula film, in my opinion, is Bram Stoker's Dracula, directed by Francis Ford Coppola (the Godfather trilogy) and starring Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Academy Award winner Sir Anthony Hopkins, Keanu Reeves, Cary Elwes, Sadie Frost, Monica Belluci, Richard E. Grant, Bill Campbell and Tom Waits as Renfield.Skip this pile of ash."
"I can't even call this incarnation ""Dracula"" for to do is to insult all the wonderful movies and TV shows portraying Dracula. The writing is horrid, the acting is mediocre at best and the story?  Hideous."
"I couldn't take more than three episodes of this insufferable, nonsensical, distorted, often confusing rendition of Dracula, which, to a lover like myself of the traditional vampire legend, came across as unpardonable sacrilege from every fundamental point of view you can imagine.I'll be astonished if this meandering venture into the absurd -- geez, at least if were good tongue-in-cheek! -- manages to last  through Season Two without being pitilessly yanked off the air.Resurrect (if at all possible) vampire count Christopher Lee, and consign Jonathan Rhys Meyers' useless Dracula to the scrap heap of cinematic bombs!"
"Bad writing, fake looking costumes... Pretty people in a bad series.  I don't know what to say other than it's a hot mess."
was not impressed by the pilot and will not be ordering any more episodes.  no new twists very ho hum.
It was alright.  I was not crazy about it when I saw the pilot and never keep up with it.
"I thought I would give the movie a chance, knowing that some movies can start off slow. After 15 minutes I had to give up. I was not impressed with any of the acting in this film. Take heed and pass this one by, it was not well made or any good acting in it."
"I love this type of horror movie, &#34;found footage&#34; but I stopped watching after the first 20 minutes and fast forwarded through some of that, boring."
"This drowsy movie will have you sleepy like a lil baby in no times, G. No only is it a horribly acted &#34;VHS&#34; horror flick, it seem like they ain't take the time to write no script either. I had drank like three redbulls and a five hour energy before watching, and it still had me snoozing like a lil baby is. This is CRAPPOLA LONGSTOCKINGS to the UMPTEEN!"
"Only watched about 20 minutes of the first episode...had to turn it of.  HORRIBLE television.  No plot, no plan, nothing to interest."
"There is absolutely no substance to this series.  I would not recommend anyone to waste their time watching it.  There are a few moments which are amusing but I found myself skipping through the first episode, and not wanting to watch another episode.."
"If this was a spoof on exorcist/possession movies it might have been marginally acceptable. But, outside of the frequent profanities and really bad fakey vomiting, well pretty boring. Unless you like bad makeup and lots of throwing Holy water around."
"Horror comedy about a bunch of blasphemous exorcists who regularly engage in sin because that somehow makes them better at casting out demons.  The premise makes no sense whatsoever but that wouldn't be a big problem if there were laughs--but the only way this movie could actually be less funny would be if it gave you cancer, too.  Some movies just don't work--Hellbenders fails miserably as a comedy or horror film--it's genuinely painful to sit through."
"As poorly written, a doesn't make sense story, as a writer's imagination can create. A really cheap production with dumb dialogue; cheap props; location sets; scripted acting.1. An approximately fifteen year old girl leaves America to live in a country home in Wales with cousins. Of course she's as opposite in lifestyle as possible to make her adjustment a subplot. That overused stereotype came across as artificial and not believable.2. The Wales country home is unkept with unwashed dishes piled high as a small girl, middle teen brother and older teen brother (who seems to be able to talk to animals) run the place. Their mom, who is suppose to be highly educated, appears to be jetting off to Europe to discuss peace concerning some unknown adversaries all the while leaving the kids unattended.3. Subplot of American girl and teen cousin having intimate relations. OK, that's morally up-lifting.4. Adversaries first called terrorists (the latest craze in movies - terrorploitation) who set off a nuclear bomb destroying London (blast felt in Wales). Movie writers script-in that tens of thousands die. The writers need some science & history education; if they followed Hiroshima they would know it would be in the hundreds of thousands and higher.5. Terrorists or invaders (out of the blue it's changed into a war), where they come from and who they are is never explained, yet they suddenly have all of Britain under siege.6. Military starts rounding up all the country people and putting them into work camps as the invaders take over. The physical capacity to do all that is pure writer make believe if you think of the numbers involved. We don't see the military fighting anyone but they are good at putting all of Britain into gathering vegetable on a few work farms.7. Suddenly invaders are gone and Britain is back to normal. Ughhh!"
This movie was horrible. It was way better than sharknado but that isn't saying much. This movie was depressing. I like survival type movies but this was not really cool in that way at all. It was very slow and boring. The character development was not good at all. And it bothered me that she started sleeping with her cousin. Creepy. I don't really like seeing young kids get killed for no reason either without an explanation. It was like they were trying to create drama but with bad taste. The story focuses more on the blonde with a bad attitude and her relationship with her cousin. I am sad I wasted my money on this.
Do not waste your money on this one! Not worth it for $8 rent! Better wait for it on Netflix.
"Not Worth the Time!  This movie started great and seemed to be building into a great thriller.  This movie was much more of a failed B movie, drama.  The only reason why I even thought of renting this (and paying $10!) was because it had Jessica Biel in it...I would totally pass on this movie!"
Don't waste your time or money watching this show. 3 red-necks and a woman running around in the woods looking for big-foot banging on  trees and yelling to get a response. either way its not as good as I thought it would be. The people make the show and these 4 don't make it happen. It must appeal to some because it has returned for its 5th season. and don't get me  wrong nothing wrong with red-necks. yee haw  :)
"I was very disappointed in this movie. This thing is essentially a horror movie rather than a true sci-fi. Since it was released to On Demand on Oct. 31 which is Halloween, it falls into that category of a sci-fi/horror flick. So they have this alien bacteria that takes over people's bodies and they then go mad and into a killing spree, but the possessed bodies are almost impossible to kill. If I hadn't paid good money to watch this thing, I would have bailed after the first 20 minutes or so. And it only got worse from there. As far as I am concerned, this was a waste of my money and time."
"Acting was good, directing was great.  But...please, another depressing, icky, predictable re-make of a very old horror story?  And I paid $9.99 to rent.  Yes I did not read the reviews.  I'm just so starved for a movie that doesn't make me want to gag that I took the chance.  I really like the main actor, wish he could find a better script.  Where are the writers?  The creative folk?  The story tellers?  I would not mind paying so much if I could just see a really great movie."
"Dear Hollywood: Please stop making bad movies about Mars. The Red Planet alone is not enough to carry a movie.The best example possible is ""Last Days on Mars,"" which has no plot or concept beyond ""there are zombies... ON MARS!"" I can't imagine that anyone involved put any more thought into this movie than ""zombies... ON MARS!"", because there is literally nothing else to it. It's a mediocre, unscary zombie story transplanted into a shallow copy of ""Alien.""And while it stars two actors that I adore, their good performances couldn't save this wretched pile of festering fetid celluloid -- it has no plot, no real climax, a third act that drags on forever, and characters with the depth of a shopping list.Mankind has landed on Mars, and now scientists have gone there to do... stuff. Their goals are never really explained. Then a team finds a mysterious bacterium growing on Mars, but before they can study it further, one of the astronauts falls into a sinkhole and dies. Then he comes back as a desiccated mummy, and immediately power-drills one one of his crewmates... and no, that is NOT a euphemism.Yes, the mysterious bacteria turns people -- living or dead -- into zombies, and it takes almost nothing to infect people. The astronauts frantically try to stop the zombies who (for some reason) are desperate to kill them, and must find a way off Mars before all of them are infected. And since this is trying to be ""Alien"" with zombies, they want to keep it from reaching Earth.It is honestly difficult to summarize this turd. Here's how I imagine the conception of this movie went: two inept Hollywood producers were sitting together, having a conversation.""Hey, I've got this idea. It's zombies...""""Totally overdone.""""... ON MARS.""""Genius! It technically hasn't been done before! We're greenlighting it!""That is the entire plot. No twists. No unexpected discoveries. No suspense about how they will stop the bacterium. It's just a string of zombie attacks that lead to nothing, placed in a third-rate ""Alien"" clone -- there is literally nothing to watch except the astronauts being infected and zombified one by one. It's not suspenseful, just depressing.First-time director Ruairi Robinson just doesn't have the chops (yet) to pull off a full-length movie. Most of it is shot at night, where it is impossible to see anything except darkness and clouds of red dust, and the assorted astronauts all look identical in their suits. Even worse, the ending drags on forever. The final half-hour is the longest third act I've ever seen in a movie -- just a slow, climax-free drag that finally putters out when Robinson runs out of things to do.It also has characters just deep enough to give you paper cuts. There's a halfhearted attempt to give Liev Schreiber's character a tragic past, by hinting at a disaster that has made him claustrophobic (for some reason). But the disaster is never expounded on, and it's just sort of dropped halfway through the movie. The rest of the characters can be summed up in one or two words -- Abrasive, Leader, Perky, Coward, et cetera.And honestly, the actors deserved better. Liev Schreiber gives a sort of halfhearted but serviceable performance; Romola Garai seems to be pouring her heart into a thanklessly shallow role, but she does give the movie its only moment of real pathos. There are other good actors here -- Goran Kosti&#263;, Elias Koteas -- but they're pretty much cannon fodder. Tossing out a mention of a character having kids does not make them three-dimensional.""Last Days on Mars"" is just another dumb, inept zombie movie, and setting it on the maligned Red Planet doesn't really improve matters. Only die-hard fans of Schreiber or Garai should even bother."
I love Schrieber but I hated this movie it was long it was the worst alien ripoff I've ever seen and I couldn't wait for to be over if I hadn't purchased it I would've given up
Another zombie movie. Poor lighting. Poor sound. In the dark half the time. This has food actors who are stuck with a lousy script.
"I am guilty. I am sorry. I violated my own rules. I didn't look at the reviews. I fell for the preview. I PAID $9.99 to RENT a digital movie.Kill me now. I deserve it.This movie btw, sucks in every possible manner. It would have been a waste of money at $.99, let alone $9.99.Don't be made at Amazon though. They are only passing along the prices set by the movie folks. It is against THESE that we must revolt. I thought I was PURCHASING this movie. My bad for not reading before clicking. It was a $10 learning experience.I admit lately I have been paying $14.99 or $19.99 to buy a digital movie, or $4.99 or $6.99 to rent one. And that is, in all cases, too much. Poor people, and yeah, I am one, cannot afford these kinds of prices for movies. Not for DVDs even, and especially not for a digital movie. $4.99 for a rental is pushing it. $6.99 is wrong. $9.99 is a sin against the customer. Amazon should recognize this. But, thanks to people like me, and my erroneous ways, they will not.We must then band together and agree to stop paying these absurdly inflated prices just because Hollywood says so.The movie had little substance. A worn out story line, cheap monster masks, aggravating flashing lights, poor audio (by this I mean that when an actor mumbles, it is bad, but if he or she has a &#34;foreign&#34; accent (in this case Russian or Irish) then it really blows!!I cannot recommend this movie. Not at any price other than FREE. I should have waited til it hit the PRIME side of Instant Video.Un-be-lieveable!"
"I can't even wrap my mind around how awful this film is.  In every way, it's a total waste of time."
"I know now why I have no reason to visit GA.They have the most illiterate, embarrassing and dehumanizing, uneducated women/men on this show.These women are obviously ignorant and Nene is the top of the class dumbest, waste of humanities life on the show.TOTALLY DISAPPOINTING."
"Do you like whining?  Do you like childish drama?  Do you like meaningless lives lived in a shameless way?  Do you like women one step away from streetwalking, welfare, jail time, and the grave because of their money's security?  Then watch this show.It is meaningless garbage.  A peek into why other poor countries must hate America.  Money misused.  Minds underused.I will say this, if you have food poisoning and need to vomit, try watching a few episodes with a bucket handy."
"I ordered the season pass to The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Please confirm that is the show I've ordered and not  Vanderpump Rules. If your customers want to see Vanderpump Rules they will likely order it. I thought the new cast members would be really introduced, not all these kids who work in a restaurant from another show. Hopefully this will be the last advertising coup at our expense."
"I don't like what this show has become at all. The new girls are all in a snotty gang with Lisa-focusing on every real or imagined flaw the remaining 3 might possess. Kim and Kyle are kind of off on their own with Joyce, and they all seem as baffled as I am.  I have to say-am I the only one who finds Brandi to be massively offensive, overbearing, mean and immature? The only thing more baffling than her presence on the show is the tolerance and infinite free passes the snobbiest gals of the bunch give her on a very regular basis, finding her gauche and crude behavior, dress and speech &#34;charming&#34; and &#34;refreshing&#34;. She blurts out any rude, stupid and provocative thing that pops into her, um, brain at any given moment-and the snobs who would be &#34;appalled&#34; if Kim, Kyle, or, God forbid, Joyce said the same thing-just laugh and pat her on the shoulder and make excuses for her. Gawd, bring back Adrienne, Camille, and even Taylor, and dump the snobs - especially the one whose height in inches exceeds her IQ. Nobody seems to want to admit that she really is horrible and a bad addition to the show-she is a crap-stirrer and just needs to go.  I would even welcome back Dana -who seemed to just vanish- with her crude pronouncements  about how much her trivial possessions cost! This show-as &#34;housewife&#34; shows go, has become a train wreck that is very hard to watch. It's not entertaining, it is insulting and mean-like Brandi. Can you imagine what she was like in jr high? I would bet-a lot like she is now. Horrid."
"Oh boy, I can see where it goes from here! These women are being mean girls. I don't know if it's because they don't like working together but are doing it for the show or what. Now, Kyle needs to get real with herself. Really? You are going to act like everyone is ganging up on you because people in the press are classifying your husband as a cheater? There is some truth in the tabloids. It may not all be true but they published that story for a reason! Kyle, it would be wise to stop throwing stones when you live in a glass house. No one can talk about your situation but clearly you are being a bully with the Wiccan. I hope she tears you a new one lol!I don't know, maybe Kyle isn't intentionally a bully but she surely comes off that way. How rude of her to make fun of that woman's child's name....I'm going to try and finish out the season but this show is getting old.."
"Nothing but stupid, vain, rich, vapid housewives who will never understand how hard life can really be, yet poor women enjoy watching this dreck. What has our country and culture come to."
I have to agree with the rest of the reviews. They need to drop the SuR drama employees. Their annoying anyway. I absolutely love Lisa but her employees are making her look bad.Those waitresses are way fake wannabes.  People like that will lie and use people to get somewhere. Their dorks. I don't want to pay to watch a bunch of dorks when I can just go down to Hollywood and find them on the street there. I want to see a 100% full hour of BHHW drama. Not 80% Real Housewives and 20% dorks. It's fine if you want to do a show with just dorks but I don't want to be forced to watch dorkism.
"Whining.  Complaining.  Meaningless drama.  Wealthy women who--without their money--would be street walking, on welfare, cleaning bathrooms, in jail, on drugs in an alley, or in the grave wasting good earth.There is nothing redeeming about this show.  It is an excellent example of how American society breeds the most useless of human beings and exploits them.If you are training up kids, show them an episode or two so that they understand what &#34;the bottom&#34; is that a human being can hit."
Zzzzzzzzzzz!
"If you believe this tale, I have a health care web site to sell you cheap. If you like you bogus Warren Commission Report, you can keep your bogus Warren Commission Report. Period!JFK, RFK, MLK and Malcolm X were four leaders, two black, two white, slain in the 1960's by the same men (LBJ and JEH). This version, based on the debunked and disregarded WCR, is as hokey as it wants to be.The only redeeming quality here was to see how much FACT is totally disregarded by the WCR crowd. Too much license was taken to fill in the parts that would go unexplained without some fabrication."
"IT'S A REAL STINKER MY FRIENDS....IF U R A SEASONED VIEWER OF ALL GENRES OF FILM, THIS WILL DISAPPOINT U....ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE,ALTHOUGH THE RABID PEOPLE HANGING ABOUT FROM THE TREES AND SUCH WAS A NICE TOUCH...WHY, OH WHY, DON'T MOVIE PEOPLE VIEW THE FINISHED PRODUCT OF THE FILM THEY R ABOUT TO RELEASE? SOMEONE TRIED VERY HARD WITH THIS ONE, I THINK.......BUT, (I'M SORRY!),IT NEEDS TO BE TOSSED IN AN 'OPEN GRAVE.'M.P."
"Outside of a window suddenly being blown out and water in a room the only part of the movie that looked like Katrina were the borrowed news casts of that event. All the hospital events seemed artificial, contrived, made up - just not believable. Searching for batteries and other items; hand cranking a generator to power a life support for a baby; killing intruders (even they seemed overly scripted). Acting was TV soap opera drama filled with predictable bad or non-decisions just to sustain 90 minutes."
"THIS MOVIE LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE GOOD! BUT I WOULD NOT KNOW SINCE I DIDNT GET TO WATCH IT! BUT I WAS CHARGED FOR ITAND THEY TOOK IT OUT OF MY ACCOUNT BUT I NEVER GOT TO WATCH IT! WHAT IS GOING ON WITH AMAZON,IT SEEMS THEY ARE MAKING CHANGES TO THE WAY THRY DO BUSINESS AND IT ISNT GOOD!"
"NOT FOLLOWING THE PERIOD,THEY ARE SMOKING FILTERED CIGARETTES,I REALLY DON'T THINK SO IN 1947THE NIGHT CUB MUSIC VERY GOOD"
"Wow...I wont go into details, who the writer is, producer, actors, or compare it much to anything.  I took this film because there was a time where I just could not get enough of IFC films.  This movie although everyone seems to hate the plot?  I think the plot was okay. It is not cut and dry that a lesbian turns into a zombie after a one night stand. What bothered me was I thought the plot was okay. Not great but worth a watch. Then The actress who plays the lead (Sam) is fantastic.  You will see her in future films trust me.  But once you know what is wrong with her, and you know early on, the movie leads you nowhere. The whole movie is about watching her decay?  That is it.  I wont give the ending away.  I will just say I don't think there was an ending.  It started out with an idea, but never went forward, and then completely just went flat.  There were events that made no sense, and had nothing to do with the story. They took a good idea, and turned it into a B movie.  What a shame.  I think you will be very unhappy if you watch it. I wont say don't watch it, because everyone should make up their own mind. This was really a bad movie. I would not have watched it for free if i had the chance if i knew what it was before hand.  The only thing good was the  main character. Meaning her as an actress.  She goes to a party, she is in love with a girl who wants her space. She has sex with a guy you don't see.  And then she looks to be pregnant and then gets really sick which people are calling her a zombie.  I don't know what she is or what the point was?  And when you see the end?  I think you will be highly upset.  Oh, and she sees the doctor two times, and not once does she get sent to a hospital. Ask yourself if you watch this, if you saw this girl looking like this, would you not send her to the hospital?  It was just poor writing, and the movie went nowhere.  Wow i have never given such a bad review."
"I really always want to like this show. I wish Bravo could come up with someone who was really a GOOD matchmaker because the concept is soooo good. But this is the best of all of the ones I have seen, mostly because of the Pattimelts. She is so unpredictable, which is like watching a train jump the tracks. Even so, it is not enough. She hardly ever gets it right, and how could she with this &#34;line-up and act and dress like something you are not&#34; approach. It is all so surface. She coaches them on how to be what the millionaire wants. Not good. And it all happens so badly.Here is the right show. Take the Million Dollar Listing show and have several matchmakers trying to &#34;sell&#34; a client. See multiple dates (just like you see all these property showings).  It would be really really great!Of course, any time you have a long running show, you run a risk when the side kicks leave, and the two she had were really good. They just sort of helped round her out."
"This whole show went downhill fast!  Very bummed!  It had some potential but it is not pulling anything off except an effort to gross you out and pin every stupid sex act for shock value gee, havent seen enough of that garbage around.... Where is the storyline???"
"This show is garbage ; it has terribly wooden acting , stupid plots and nothing but a ton of shootouts to try to distract viewers from realizing this is crap . Attempting to make a modern day Western is just stupid because the Wild West days are over . Just more brain dead cult tv from FX ."
"Boring short, silly. Not a couples film. Not a film at all. Doesn't really do much but tell a story about two kids. Who then die."
"It had that &#34;Made in Mexico&#34; TV soap opera quality that their film industry is noted for. Son and daughter while on camping trip with parents go for short jaunt from the campsite into the nearby hills, find a small cave and come out possessed. I guess Satan can't afford better digs! Cheap filming, robotic acting and an improbable storyline led to a lot of ff to avoid boredom. Nothing really happens the whole movie - no budget for even cheap props."
"This movie was done like a home video! The acting was terrible and the story was lame. Oh MY! I could not even finish watching this. I was hoping fro a funnny little story-I didn't have big expectations, even though the cover of this is plastered with &#34;awards&#34;! Even with low expectations this file failed to deliver on any level. Geez-this is the first time I wanted my money back from Amazon for a movie."
"We all learn eventually that life isn't always fair, nice guys don't always win, and brown nosing often has unfair rewards.  I can't decide what kind of disorder this woman has, besides extreme narcissism, but something is very wrong. My best guess is that she got bullied in school, never asked to the dance-and now thinks it's her turn, as an adult, to hurt the moms she belittles out of envy-she has no husband and kids to go home to, no gal pals she doesn't have to terrorize/bribe into hanging out with, no little black dresses to work enough magic on her with. I'm not trying to be mean-nobody has it all. Just, why hate on innocent kids of moms she is jealous of or just plain mad at? It's beyond pathetic or unprofessional - it's sick. You just don't treat people this way-especially little kids.Interesting that Abby called Payton out -who surely was a big bully-so early on, while being literally the biggest meanest bully ever! Who can forget her bawling openly-instead of ""saving her tears for her pillow"" as she so cruelly yelled at virtually every child there to do at various times-when Maddie  *gasp* screwed up, then screaming, when called out on it ""oh well, some kids are just special!"" No, Abby, ALL of those kids are special, and if you weren't so focused on one kid, you couldn't help but see that!  Then, on this latest episode we hear Maddie turn from what once seemed like a nice person into a little snot-her response to a TEAMMATE's being legitimately upset over something that would have thrown HER (the sorest loser on the team) into ""the vapours"" was to cynically spit out "" it's two minutes in life-she just needs to get over it."" No matter how often she wins, that is behavior of a loser. Neither Melissa nor Abby are doing her any favors. She is going to grow up thinking she's just a little bit better than the rest of us. Life has a way of sending us lessons about ego and such, when we need them. And not so many friends. Maddie is in for a rough time when those lessons start coming and she sees what divatude attracts-and doesn't.  She is a child-at this point she still has that time/excuse-but, unfortunately, a few key very poor role models.Just imagine what the otherlifers-Brooke, Paige, Nia, and Chloe -could be and do with equal love and attention? They are absolutely wonderful despite the bullying and the uneven playing field-while managing to be nice little girls who don't think they are better or make snarky comments-I just wish they could manage to not OWN Abby's words quite so much. Living well is the best revenge, and they all have the talent to draw themselves up and show Abby out of spite if nothing else-Chloe has beaten the favorite before, and I'd love to see Maddie up against any of the others in Hip Hop, Paige especially. Ironically,,they are the product Miss Abby created, and they deserve and could be so much more. It was egregious to pit the two duets -TEAMMATES-against one another, and if the blondes had had the confidence they should have , they could have come out on top, particularly if they had gotten the encouragement and rehearsal time the Teammate/competitors (who DOES that?) had been given. Seriously, not only is there more than one good dancer on the TEAM, for Abby to think that she had only produced one and that she genuinely needs a traveling side show to find other schools' talent to poach to build a winning team really is selling herself a bit short. She has had winning TEAMS -including THIS one- for years. To pimp herself out as dance 's version of Simon Cowell for a bit more fame/attention...kind of speaks for itself, at that. Is she all about Going Hollywood or is she in the legitimate business of molding talented professional career-driven dancers for the sake of the art that she poses as?I do know that if this is real, I wouldn't subject my child to either end of the Dance Dementia spectrum-and I think being the pet would be the most damaging position of all, long term.Kendall is not a lifer, to her benefit-but she is developing the same pained ""I just sat on the point of the top of the pyramid"" expression on her face while she dances that The Favorite always has. The fact that her mom has a habit of repeatedly lapsing into ""I"" or ""we"" as in ""I should have had that solo"" or ""we shouldn't be last on the pyramid"" is both telling and disturbing. Even her kid tells her to knock it off.. I'm always thinking of Nia, Paige, Brooke, and Chloe, who have been there languishing in obscurity since toddler-hood every time Jill starts with what ""we"" deserve. Does the woman ever listen to herself?Ironically, Abby seems to be biting out of the same rotten Ohio Apple as her smarmy competitor -ignoring an opportunity to turn confidence, energy and deserved equal attention from the products of a lifelong devotion to her studio, despite the abuse, favortism, and neglect they're repeatedly subjected to-instead, poaching from the fruits of competition studios' labor. As several savvy moms have repeatedly pointed out, is the irony of this completely lost on her? She has greater confidence in the products of other studios than in her own? What's next, strutting around wearing molting rat fur vests,  looking like a multi-colored rat is loose on her head, calling everyone else's ""fashion"" tacky while Applepolishing purchased talent ""guest choreographers"", recruiting from utube and thinly-veiled publicity sucking ""twittercalls"" -oh wait, she's already doing most of that! Why not try being creative, developing from within her ranks to give the same attention, choreography, costumes, private lessons, interest and encouragement to all that she pours into the only one who truly reflects the results of her lifelong tutelage that she has deemed worthy? Let's see THEN what happens. I think, frankly, she's selling herself way too short, and I wish it was just her problem.This show used to be fun. Now, if it is real, it really crosses the line into abuse and, in either case, it stopped being fun to watch long ago. She is no longer a professional, she is out of control, mean, abusive, and needs to get over the whole big mouth big hair big fingernails and big ego, etc.-a caricature every plus-sized drag queen parade has undoubtedly added to their routine.But that's her problem. Unfortunately, I fear that all of these kids will need therapy. Abby needs to get first in line, and today's favoriteright behind her.She knows less about real class than Cathy Apple does, and that's saying something."
"If you enjoy watching children being abused by an emotionally stunted ego-maniacal bitch ... then this is your show.I'm ashamed to admit I watched Dance Moms for years.  I loved seeing the children dance, so I'd fast forward the seemingly staged Mama-drama and clips of Abby shouting herself into chronic laryngitis.  Last year it slowly dawned on me that these people aren't faking.Many of the adults on this show are emotional train wrecks.  Abby really is a pretentiously self serving fowl mouthed (yeah I know she says she doesn't use bad words) bitch, who doesn't give a $***about anyone's feelings but her own.  She's also a child abuser in the WORST way.  What kind of wacked out idiot would label a child ""road kill"" on national TV?!  Why would ANYONE constantly reduce children to tears on national TV?!  That these kid's parents pay Abby to constantly hurt their children makes them just as bad.As an adult survivor of child abuse, I know how much damage words can cause.  That this show is allowed to continue, and these children remain fodder for abuse by Abby, wanna be dance teachers, supposedly well meaning Dance Moms, wanna be Dance Moms with wanna be children dancers ... turns my stomach.Mark my words, these kids are growing up with issues ... HUGE issues.  The fact that Child Protective Services hasn't been called in to investigate Ms Abby's disgusting behavior is disgraceful!The ultimate irony is the fact that Ms Abby was in bankruptcy when this horrid show started.  Shame on the producers, shame on Abby, shame on the parents and shame on us for allowing this horrid show to thrive."
"Un-watchable.  Despicable.  Shameless.  Disgusting.  If you enjoy car accidents, you might enjoy this show.  The children are brainwashed, overworked, and abused.  The parents are desperate for money or fame or a vicarious life by exploiting their children.  The people involved in the coordination and production of these talent shows, etc. are sad, creepy individuals.I guess some kids will always suffer at the hands of their parents.  This show is a sad, vomit-inducing example of sick domineering adults ruining children's lives.  Here we watch a sampling of superficial, unkind, psychologically-lost Americans.I guess there is some form of entertainment in that.  Just don't support these maniacs financially by buying the show.  If you HAVE to see this tripe, find it on cable."
Giving a reason why this movie is all kinds of awfulness would be a disservice to anyone reading this review because quite simply I had to shut it off after 20 minutes. It was that bad.
"Warning: spoilers.  Young women are kidnapped and forced to fight each other to the death for the entertainment of others.  You've very likely seen this story done before--but never with the ill-advised seriousness on display here.  Raze is filmed and scored with all the lightness and humor of a holocaust film--which pretty much drains every ounce of entertainment value from the pulpy material.The movie makes a fatal mistake almost immediately: At the start it appears that actress Rachel Nichols will be the lead, but the filmmakers pull a bait and switch--she is killed in the first fight and Zoe Bell becomes the lead character.  The problem?  While Bell, who was Uma Thurman's stunt double on the Kill Bill films, acquits herself about as well as you would expect during the fight sequences the more emotional scenes are far beyond her abilities, making it impossible to care one way or another what happens to her.  The filmmakers would have been much better off using Rachel Nichols as the lead and Zoe Bell as the villain--that way she could still do her thing in the fight scenes without killing the rest of the movie.The fight scenes are brutal but they become repetitive and dull very quickly.The only entertainment value in the entire movie is oddball character actor Doug Jones, who plays the L Ron Hubbard like cult leader who is behind the fights.  During the film's one and only truly effective scene a number of the woman are strapped down to school desks while he explains the higher purpose behind what they are doing.  Unfortunately, Jones isn't given much to play with beyond that one scene.Raze will undoubtedly appeal to people who like to see women beat the crap out of each other and require nothing more.  Everyone else is strongly advised to give Raze a pass."
"For those under the influence of sleep deprivation or LSD, Peyote, Magic Mushrooms or other hallucinogenics this would be an ideal watch!  I have never seen anything comparable to this nor would I pay money to see it.  Whose extravaganza of surround sound and visual chromatics was this and why was it created  would be my first questions???"
"This satiric take on the epic mini-series of the seventies and eighties is a one trick, one joke pony. The idea is to make fun of the tropes and melodrama of the epic, best selling, historical romances that proliferated during the period. All of the familiar elements are present: the wealthy but troubled family with secrets, their home, sometimes with hints of the gothic that represents a character in itself, unrequited love, revenge, death, business and wealth.In the real world, there is the mineable territory of Hollywood with its excesses and egotistical stars, directors and writers. S of B takes them all on, making fun of the mini-series and novels that it lampoons. Conclusion? These books and the productions based on them were melodrama that took themselves far too seriously and had quality issues of writing, directing, acting and production. That's it. That's the joke....full stop.I could get on board if I was getting a decent story and characters supporting the joke, but we don't because to give good story and characters the production team would have to resort to the techniques and tropes of  the genre they're satirizing and they can't do that because that would cut the legs from under their one joke pony. Not recommended as story or satire."
"apparently I'm going to be harassed until I leave a review of something. I clicked on it for one instant on my smart tv, read the blurb, looked at it for a minute and then removed it. Amazon has gone too far with 'capturing' customers with these tactics.  It follows you all over the net, items remain in meaningless lists related to your account, and you are plagued by related emails that have no meaning whatsoever. I'm so sorry to see Amazon take this tack. They are beginning to feel like predators rather than the rock solid online seller they used to be. :( I hope they will stop harassing me with emails now that I've left this utterly meaningless 'review'."
"I know this was supposed to be funny, but it just wasn't to my liking.  I found the acting so bad that I couldn't make it through he first episode.  Very disappointing."
"I always thought that prospecting for gold in the 19th Century Klondike  must have been quite interesting, I guess not."
I love Jeremy Irons and Charlotte Rampling&#8230;this movie tries to be interesting&#8230;but never succeeds&#8230;.my husband refused to keep watching&#8230;.had to see the end myself following day&#8230;sad to see such actors and such effort putting together a movie and then to fail so&#8230;..
"I have watched the first two episodes.So far, this is pretty unimpressive.I  am a big Fan of Billy  Campbell.I have seen most of his work over the past two decades.  I was really looking forward to this production. Campbell appears to be heavily medicated. He gives the most flat and mind numbingly boring performance of his career. Granted,  the script gives him little to nothing to work with.The first two episodes  meander all over the place. Ten minutes of modestly entertaining scenes ..... Padded out with 40 minutes of ""filler"" you won't remember tomorrow.I cannot recommend the first two episodes..."
It just wasn't that interesting and seemed to rely on soap operaish drama queen style drama.More huh?  Real stinky.
"OK, only 16 minutes give or take.  I was so bored my time would have been better spent had I taken a cat nap."
stupid show.
"I did not read the books the series is based upon.... Thus, my comments are not based on the merits of the books - but only on what I have seen on the series.A well written program should stand on its own merits - you should not need to read a series of books to make sense out of an hour long program.  Having said that, the series does not make sense to a new viewer.  There are plot holes large enough to drive a truck through.  Much of which appears on the screen just does not make sense.The tv series is a generic werewolf program. There is nothing, so far, to set it apart from the pack.The cast appears to be heavily medicated - they sleepwalk through scene after scene.  There is little to no ""dramatic tension"".  It is very difficult to feel empathy for such a bland and uninteresting cast.I cannot recommend this series."
What a waste of money this show is.  Its more about a naked blond than any real story line at all.
"Complete and utter garbage.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.One star for casting.  Pretty, sparkling people. The rest, not so much."
"This is the season that did it. I am officially not interested in any more seasons of the Bachelor. This was the most aggravating, uninteresting and insincere series of shows I have ever watched. Also, could not care less about watching Andi's season as the Bachelorette. TERRIBLE."
"If I could use one adjective to describe the Bachelor despite the numerous picks that cross my mind; *cheesy* & *ridiculous* being some, the particular word I do feel strongly about is *desperate*.Desperate for fame, recognition, attention, and obviously getting a man into their lives who can buy them expensive objects they can droll on for eternity. The show producers are desperate for ratings.Haven't anyone noticed that almost all the hand picked Bachelors are slim, youthful, successful, above average in financial well fare and model like looking? and that all the contestants are also the same?I have yet to find one season that is starring an obese or overweight bachelor that does not have a six pack but is actually sweet and gentle Or I have yet to see one season where the contestants don't all look like Kate Moss in her best years and don't even get me started on how 97% of them are ethnically white. *Gasp* did I just call the Bachelor racist?Their Hollywood mentality aside, the notion of the show is laughable and pathetic. Finding the love of your life on a prime time reality series is like finding a nutritional value in processed junk food. Why do these people need to go on TV to marry someone? And even if they ended up marrying it would be for all the wrong reasons. These people cannot assist their qualities as spouses if the only time to get to see and know each other is to make a show in front of the camera.This show could be scripted and I would be happier if it was. the relief of knowing there aren't any stupid people out there. However, sadly it doesn't look like it and there are such people."
"Greg Kinnear is normally a charming and engaging  Actor.  He had made a solid career out of playing amiable characters.This program does not play to his strengths. It is a hopeless mess that misfires on so many different levels. His character is so negative, it is hard to feel any sort of empathy.It is hard to take anything this poorly written seriously."
I would never even allow this on my TV if it were up to me but my wife likes to order these kind of &#34;family values&#34; TV shows behind my back while I'm at work.
I mean don't get me wrong I love ducks but why don't they shoot anteaters? They have been a serious problem in this country with the recent outbreak of anteaters in north Dakota back in 75. I feel like the anteaters and ducks will team up one day and what do you know its terminator all over again we are sorry we did not listen James Cameron!!!!!
After a while you just get feed up with this style of humor. Am really surprised he is still on TV
"While our country is fighting a war against terrorist, I didn't find mocking the military to be amusing. It is possible to take war serious yet let the characters have some fun - remember MASH? Enlisted is just a bunch a guy who don't belong in the military and wouldn't be funny in any occupation. I expect this new show to soon be canceled."
"A disappointing move for Geof Stults after his wonderful debut show, The Finder. I'll chalk it up to grief over the loss of a friend and a great show."
"don't waste your time, its a bunch of mumbo jumbo. and a lot of drama just for tv. its great the family is branching out...but I just cant see how it got a show"
"Since Amazon does not provide a way for season purchasers to leave reviews per episode I have to tell you that this review is for ""Filibuster"":""Filibuster"" is the worst Archer episode yet.And I've seen them all. The appearance of Krieger usually bails out a flagging episode. Not this time. Don't know how Reed managed to put multiple Krieger's in an episode and still have it nosedive into the ground but he did.This season wreaks."
I cancelled my season pass for last year and will not buy this year because I DON'T PAY FOR COMMERCIALS. Fire the person who thought it was a good idea.
"This movie was OK, seemed like there was a lot of underlying things that you were suppose to know, but the movie never went into. I took it off my watchlist"
"Every one of the high praise reviews MUST be planted by those who will gain from selling this fiasco.It was disappointing on EVERY possible level of film making and the most expensive rental I've every made the mistake of buying.I only watched the entire mess in hopes that the ending would answer the question posed, but it leaves the viewer twisting in the wind."
"Poor coordination between spoken English and subtitled English. Poor camera work; at times just shaky hand held and the scene angles were not well thought out. Acting was overly stereotyped e.g. tough cop, supervisor cop, vengeful parent, seemingly innocent victim.Lots of holes in storyline with somewhat predictable scenes including ending; no emotional connection with victims. Israeli film studios need lessons on creative writing/film making from the French, Argentinians, Koreans."
"He has decent storyline and I was looking forward to this as I love Kevin Bacon, but trite plots, very lame writing, and predictable.  I like his character though."
cheap shots and gratuitous violence do not equal a plot.  a waste of Kevin Bacon's talents.  I guffaw whenever the Joe character comes on screen.SPOILERS!!!teacher's pet:  does NO ONE ever die forever on this show...now Claire is alive too?  Snicker....
"This comes across as a desperate attempt to fill a spot on this season's series preview list. The acting was bad, and the gadgets were unrealistic. I can't see this holding a child's attention, unless they enjoy fart humor. So, so bad! Sorry. :("
"OK, a show for youngsters? Extremely poor acting&#8212;children and adults&#8212;and a &#34;who cares&#34; about them feel to this pilot. Don't bother..."
This show I would never watch. I did not like it at all. that is not to say its bad just bad for me. enjoy and watch if you like it just leaving my review.
"Just wasn't very funny, or interesting. Maybe kids will want to watch it, but it is not entertaining for adults."
"Boring, nothing new. One barely teen in the house along with friends and couldn't keep their attention for 5 minutes..."
The inventions are unrealistic. This show seems like silly fantasy masquerading as science. What's wrong with inventions that conform to physical reality? It takes real talent to make realistic and normal entertaining. This show gives the wrong messages to kids.
I had a lot of trouble understanding what the kids were saying. It was like they said everything in fast forward. And the things they did were totally unrealistic. Maybe others will like this more than I do but to me it is kind of stupid.
Don't really like the underlying tones of drug references and bullying. Not exactly how I think the pilot episode should be made. Seems in the opening since there is a kid selling candy to other kids and a bigger kid comes and tells him that her needs to get off his turf. Then pours milk in his bag of candy. Then they proceed to show the bully making bath tub candy. I don't think this was well thought out. And I immediately turned it off for these reasons. You will be amazed what kids pick up on. (Typed but not read)
Where did it go? Why would it be unavailable to stream after 5 episodes? Boo. And that is my last word.
Why did this title become unavailable with no prior notification of a availability window? This happens all too often and it is the one thing that keeps me on the fence about going all in with Amazon or going with all iTunes content instead.
This just appeared in my video library. I believe I was charged like $1.99 for this but have no idea how this purchased! There is not even a kid in the house who might have ordered this
"I would give this zero stars if I could. No educational value whatsoever. Why give kids the idea that they can be great at something just by wishing for it and not having to work for it. Only potential lesson was to help your friends if you have the means to do so but it was so brief and subtle I'm sure kids don't pick up on. The story/plot was so repetative, with zero value added by being so, that i got the impression they ran out of material before they ran out of time. Advice to the producers: if you're going to have a show about magic dust that makes the characters good singers and dancers 1) hire good singers to sing and 2) do your research to learn as least one dance move to animate the characters doing said moves... having them shake their hips back and forth and pump their fists in the air is not dancing, let alone good dancing. Invest in the products you want to succeed or don't bother. What a waste of my and my daughters' time."
I can see why it lasted a few episode.  It just was not an attention grabber and my son walked away after less than 5 min of it playing.
Can't decide what I just watched. The cast lacked chemistry at the beginning and none of them became compelling for me through the end.  Half way through I was waiting for it to be over with.  Would not watch it after first episode.
"I'll start by saying I'm glad so many others are enjoying this. The next paragraph spoils an early scene. It's a minimal spoiler, but is the most significantAs a lover of science fiction (Firefly, Almost Human, Bladerunner the book, Robotech), I found the first 25 minutes were a real turn-off. I was almost hooked, however, by the girl's scene in the mirror whose acting originally made my wife and I exclaim, &#34;What a terrible actress!&#34; only to learn that she's *playing* a terrible actress. Cleverly done, I must say. :)Unfortunately, I dislike plots driven by the unseen. I hated Blair Witch, despised Super 8, and found Lost and Fringe boring, as the unseen is too predictable in that it simultaneously potentiates all possible story arcs. Perhaps this show appeals to fans of those films; I applaud them and am glad they have something else to enjoy. This one is a pass for me, however.I am glad for those who are enjoying themselves, however. :D"
"Ugh.  I wanted so much to like this show since it's an Amazon original, but it's HORRIBLE.  There was more swearing in this than in any movie I've seen. That one character (I didn't care enough about it to learn their names) swore so much that I dreaded it every time he started to speak.  Every other word out of his mouth was the ""F"" word.  (kind of ironic, not being allowed to swear on here when their ""Amazon original"" series is full of swearing!)  Good cast but horrendous acting, horrible script, and gratuitous nudity, all add up to a ZERO STARS rating.  Thumbs down, Amazon.  :("
"Low budget, ridiculous script, amateur directing.  Ten minutes was more than enough to know that this was a waste of 10 minutes.Obviously the positive reviews must be planted here by those involved in the production of this high school corn."
"I couldn't sit past 34 mins at which time that writers haven't even given a clue as to why the city is in crisis (which started at the beginning of the show).  And if you get mad at those typical TV things that would never happen in real life, then skip this one."
Great actors and good cinematography.  Horrible plot line and stupid characters.  The writers need to be more creative than dropping the F word to fill up the time.  It made the actors seem like stutters with Tourette Syndrome.  If at all possible avoid this show.  There are better apocalyptic shows to spend your time on.
"Rather than repeat the detailed comments by others I just want to say that this is a seriously dumb show thanks to a) crappy plotting, b) cliched characters, c) ethnic stereotypes (I did enjoy the drunken Irishman - don't see that one too often these days) and routine direction. Example: since motor vehicles still work, why is everyone wandering aimlessly around central LA?  Did the POV characters somehow spend more than 24hrs in the elevator and parking garage and not notice the passage of that much time?  Oh, and a UH-60 just flies up and crashes into an LAPD chopper.  That deserves at least a little explanation.  Do the producers realize that apocalypse thing has been done to death?  Apparently not."
"All I have to say is &#34;Why&#34; Amazon.  You take something really good & have good potential of becoming the first show to take over &#34;Dead man Walk&#34; and turn it to a trash.  I really wish they didn't put the nude scenes.  I understand it is not a regular TV, but still I would've liked to be more realistic than someone is scared to death find the time to enjoy a swim naked."
"This is sad.  It's all so hackneyed.  It's like Chris Carter took the lamest and most cliched aspects of every recent dystopian/Armageddon story, poorly dramatized them, and then picked the most stereotypical and most unsympathetic characters, and made a tasteless bento box out of it."
"Can I have my hour back please?I really hate twists at the end of shows and movies that have very little to do with the show or movie I just watched, but I imagine it MUST be hard to fasten on a twist ending when the entire plot is a slimy eel wriggling in your grasp. That's simile.I'm not sure what was going on, and I don't guess that this show knew, either. I think the writers were watching ""The Walking Dead"" and thought aloud:""Let's make a show about OUR OWN apocalypse!""""But, hey,"" another writer said, ""zombies are SO last week.""""Vampires have been done to DEATH,"" injected Jamie Kennedy, coughing and stuffing his face with cheese puffs. ""What HASN""T been done in a while...or EVER (successfully)?"" They all shrugged their shoulders in a non-committal fashion and started hacking out the script for ""THE AFTER"".Putting aside the bong, they busted out the 20 sided die* they had from their Dungeons and Dragons game and made an alphabetic list of things that could cause an apocalypse that might be remotely entertaining, beginning with Aliens, and ending in Zombie-hybrids (leaving out E for ""Ear Mites"", I for ""Indiana Jones Impersonators"", L for ""Leprechauns"", P for ""Preying Mantis"", R for ""Rascally Rabbits"", and W for ""Wascally Wabbits"", much worse than the former).The only saving grace with the characters is that they were so fresh and original, no cobwebs to dust off these babies! A black prisoner innocently convicted, a white lawyer who's secretly corrupt, a vaguely hispanic female cop with everything to prove, a gay guy with a wacky day job, a slutty blond from someplace South-ish, a rich jewish lady with a spanish housekeeper, and... this will shatter your religion... an IRISHMAN who drinks WAY too much! It's preposterous! Am I forgetting someone...? Oh, yeah, the security douche bag. I think there was a protagonist too here somewhere, but tacked on in a slap-dash manner and thinly portrayed. Not worth further examination.That's called sarcasm.The featured characters are what Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter called ""Desperately Random"", which means NOT RANDOM AT ALL, but wishing to SEEM so. In THE AFTER's sense, it means that the characters are so oddly varied and/or paradoxically foiled against one another that it makes one wonder if they used that same 20 sided die to determine what half of the characters would be from the list: ""Harry's Hackneyed Stereotypes to Avoid at All Costs!"", and the other half just trying to make some allegorical diatribe about how things should be in a perfect world we don't have (boo-freaking-hoo!). Every time the convict talked about black folk in jail I wanted to slap him.Foil: innocent black man sent to prison for a murder he didn't commit vs. slick, white lawyer breaking the law by soliciting a hooker in a public stairway.Foil: same innocent black man with the ""CAN DO!"" attitude vs. the passive-aggressive white-spanish cop seeking to put him away, but ultimately, and utterly, ineffectual in any real sense. She was the ONLY authority figure in the ambulance and just caved like a jellyfish to the whim of the very guy she was sworn to capture. She would happily put away that innocent black man, but he's too busy delivering CANDY CANES and WHOOP-BUTT to protect the group, and he's FRESH OUT OF CANDY CANES, baby!I think the events that not even the police or the crowds stumbling around oblivious even realized was going on (...Wait, WHAT?!?!?!..) was that someone farted on set, and it was just really, really bad, so they had hours and hours of footage trying to figure out who farted. Seriously. Watch the parts of the show where people are just wandering vaguely here and there, scared of nothing in particular, but refusing to go back to their ordinary lives, and just imagine someone off camera letting one rip. You will suddenly understand method acting.At one point, all the people are racing around with luggage like they all remembered they had planned a trip to Majorca that afternoon and they're all going to miss their flight.Keep in mind, all this time there is NO ACTUAL APOCALYPSE going on. There are NO ZOMBIES, or anything else ATTACKING ANYONE, NOTHING is BLOWING UP, STARTING on FIRE, SHOOTING PEOPLE or BEING SHOT at BY people, and yet the mob of pedestrians decide to attack the group as if the ""heroes"" were Bogarting the latest iPhone design! It would be like you hearing a boom, losing power in your work, going outside, and then losing your mind with no conception of why you were there, blundering about for 45 clueless minutes and THAT'S when you see a group of folk in an ambulance and you just have to tear them apart with your bare hands for no particular reason! Why in the heck doesn't anyone just go home or back to work?Perhaps that's the reason why there's the non-apocalypse and suddenly a group that has no reason at all for hanging out together suddenly go all Scooby Doo Mystery Solvers Club despite their vast differences--or their secret sameness-ess-ess...? I don't even think the actors knew that the big-screen quality of the first 95 POINTLESS percent of the movie was going to sprint right into a cheesy ""B"" production right at the end. That's the REAL twist. Surprise! There's NO MORE MONEY LEFT to shoot this show. We blew it renting a wedding mansion, the 200,000 stand-ins, and these cameras. Good thing we didn't RENT the cameras, or they'd be going back, too.They really believed that if they just gave the group enough momentum that their pace alone would mop up any plot leaks, but it actually WAS the plot (or plot-synthetic) sprinkled all-too-liberally with brief, shambling pauses for character development. There's NO TIME TO EXPLAIN! Get out of the elevator! Now, let's talk about our feelings. Get out of the parking garage! Now, let's talk about our feelings. Get out of the street! Let's hear about those feelings. Get back to your hotel room! Now, let's hash out our feelings. Get in the ambulance! Quick, feelings? Bust into the mansion! Consensus... feelings? Sprint into the forest! Let's see how we're feeling. Get fondled by a naked, tattooed contortionist in grey henna! Feelings anyone? Get in your time machine and warn yourself not to watch this show... awe, dang. Can't do that last one. Show's over. Maybe time travel will be in the next episode. I have a... feeling that it might (could be F&%$#&G; anything, really).*Spoiler - They landed on D for ""Demons from the Netherworld"", and guess what? Each character has the same birthday. Hmm. Not sure that matters in the history of ever. Oh, but they each have a tattoo-like birth mark that together make some sick artwork on the back of the demon that stalks them for the last two minutes of the show so that it can give them shoulder massages in the forest. So, the fact that the SCG (Stereotypical Character Gang) are all suddenly so chummy and comfortable around each other is because they are all secretly connected despite having been introduced in an entirely (muffled snickering) random way. I'm blowing your mind now. Sorry. (SHHH.. its not random at all... keep it a secret...)I cannot even imagine what randomly (hehe) generated cinematic gold we will stagger into aimlessly in the next episode! If anyone in the next episode says anything to the kin of ""You guys are my family, now!"" I'm going to have to wash my eyes out with soap."
"Stereotypical characters, marginal performances, someone trying to get in on the whole &#34;under the dome&#34; craze.And they're running sirens through the whole damn episode, I started to get a headache after awhile.World is in turmoil, I get it, thumpy music is nice for accents on the plot, but drive that music through the whole show and sirens at top volume and oh yeah, that's fun to listen to (sarcasm)Hoped to get a winner from these pilots, so far, no good."
"When the main character says &#34;I just want this to end&#34;,  boy did I agree with her.  Since she is french, I'll try to say it in french:  Qu'est ce qu'on charge de merde!Everything about this was awful.  From the idea to the writing to the acting.  This is an unoriginal, uninspired cross between the Walking Dead and the show where Ichabod Crane is in 21st C New England.  it also cleaves to convention heavily; the pilot plot was quite predictable.  Oh, wait:  was that seriously Peter Sarsgaard in there for a minute?  It is shocking to see an actor of his caliber in this tripe.  THAT was unpredictable.  Honestly, this wouldn't make it ten episodes on network TV.  And that french chick is so annoying I found it difficult to make it through even one episode.  Her acting is worse than my french.  Everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves."
"Sorry, I couldn't get pass the first 5mins when the bad 'french' actress was trying to practice her audition---just horrible. Sorry, but I have to be hooked the first 5mins---like I was with 'BreakingBad', 'Dexter', 'House of Cards'------you can't start with mediocrity.....most people don't have time to sit through pretense.  For this kind of genre; I'd rather stick to watching the old school original stuff like the X-Files---much more interesting....."
"At first I was intrigued. Strangers trapped in a locked parking lot, no electricity, isolated from the rest of the city.  Then they got out and the storyline was downhill after that.The acting got worse. I'm no prude but the consistent use of the F word was both annoying and unnecessary. I wanted to stop watching  but I suffered through, hoping it might get better. And the ending was just stupid - no lead up to the last &#34;character,&#34;Bottom line is Chris Carter seems to be playing the same note and without Fox and Dana that note is not sounding good at all."
"This pilot is painful to watch! None of  characters in this pilot are likable and the acting is terrible. If you have any chores to do I would recommend doing them instead of watching this, it would be time better well spent."
"This could easily be one of those lampoons done by the Scary Movie franchise  My favorite scene was the female officer hanging on to back of the getaway ambulance.  What was she doing back there?  She was spread eagled on the back bumper with hardly a hand hold.  Was this supposed to be a dramatic act of heroics?  It looked like the rest of the group wouldn't let her ride inside because she was a minority.  Never-the-less, she seemed grateful to be allowed to ride on the back bumper and helplessly hang on for dear life as the ambulance sped through the city.Eventually, they make it out of the city after being chased by an angry mob and find refuge in the old lady's mansion, whereupon it only seems appropriate that the sexy babe character would strip entirely naked and go swimming  in the pool, because you see, they are all in the middle of an obvious crisis situation, and that's what would happen in the Scary Movie franchise."
"I am SHOCKED that this show has such high ratings.  I'm a fan of sci-fi and will generally give sci-fi shows plenty of lattitude.However, this is one of those shows where the characters are all annoying and annoyingly stupid (minus the black guy who seems to be the only person that has a clue).  Everyone else is so self absorbed, incompetent and oblivious to the situation that I wouldn't have cared if a giant UFO crashed on them and the show ended.  The show almost comes off as a comedy due to the stupidity of the characters and the ridiculous scenes.  Probably one of the worst pilots I've seen in a long time.  Unless the objective is to make the viewer hate the main characters.***spoiler alert***-Hey I'm a cop and I have my cop car but I can't drive it through the gate in the garage...for...no...reason.-Hey I'm a cop but I give up my weapon at the first sign of danger...for...no...reason.-Hey the black guy found a car jack to jack up the gate but we can't do the same in a garage full of cars...for...no...reason.-Hey let's hang off the back of the ambulance while driving through a mob...for...no...reason.-Hey a mob just tried to attack us so let's going to go skinny dipping...for...no...reason.The ridiculous scenes go on and on..."
"This show is absolutely terrible- I went into this pilot really wanting to like it as I love post apocalyptic shows/movies and really love Chris Carter's previous work but this show is flat out bad. The story makes zero sense at all, the characters are all extremely unlikable- especially the french woman who is supposed to be the main protagonist and to be perfectly honest- there is no chance any of these people would stick together within five minutes if this actually went down. The plot has ADD and skips all over, I watched this with some friends and we all went into this with an extremely open mind. There are many other good selections for amazon to pick up and I really hope this is not one of them. Don't be a sheep! actually *watch* the full pilot before you post a review please! we all love chris carter but this junk stinks. I don't post reviews but after seeing this get a bunch of positive ratings I had to do my part and tell it like it is- THIS SHOW IS AWFUL."
"Every now and again I watch a movie out of curiosity, this one is the curiosity that killed the cat, at least it smells of something dead. If f you can't come up with a disaster just make a movie about the AFTER of aaaaa, well, what ever, and anything can happen, except it doesn't. I guess they couldn't get any real talent in this production. The actors may have talent but the writing and direction are so awful it would be hard to tell.A wrongly imprisoned black man that blames his anger on his blackness, a hooker that preaches about the bible as she swims in the nude for no apparent reason...except gratuitous nudity, a b movie french actress, a cursing Irishman, cynical lawyer, an ineffectual  woman cop, and to round out the stereo types a gay clown! No really, someone apparently thought, &#34;lets take one of every kind of stereotype throw them together in a  uh well some kind of thing and make it scary&#34;,  except it isn't, not even close. Oh and the script is so cliche in its use of Scary moment devices that you just want to shoot the writer , if you could go back in time before he had this bad idea! Watch it? I wouldn't waste a match to burn it!"
"As others have written here already, this show was plain terrible. The writing was terrible. Much of the story was nonsensical. For example, I found it unbelievable that this band of people who are trapped for 15-20 minutes in a parking garage would stick together for whatever devastating event happened. The acting wasn't great, but I feel sorry for the actors because they had a bad script from which to work. If the writing was better, the acting may have been better too.I also didn't care for some of the stereotypes that were used for the characters. The foul language was a bit excessive too.I am not going to watch the next episode if this pilot gets greenlit."
"Neither of us could watch it through.  Inconsistencies abound, plot it trite, no humor to relieve tension, generally boring.  Won't watch if the series is green-lighted."
"Amazon's forays into series making is, at best, frustrating.  This is one of several that they've posted a pilot for without any follow up.  Television learned decades ago that the best method is to run a series until people stop watching.  I guess Amazon is fishing for response to see if they want to publish more, but give me a month or two after the first teaser episode, and I will have forgotten that I ever cared.  I'm giving up on the Amazon series, because it doesn't look like they've really decided to make them.  When they make up their mind and post them once a week, I may come back and get into them, but until then, these, though well-made, are no better than empty promises."
"&#34;The After&#34;, except for Aldis Hodge is jut plain horrible. It has no idea what it wants to be. It endlessly drags on and then further down the path to nothingness; boring as hell."
"I am used to watching &#34;modern&#34; dramas with some four letter words, but this one was over the top.  I would say the &#34;f word&#34; was used at least every five seconds throughout the first episode.Other than the filth mouth, I would have given the show four stars.  As a science fiction fan, I liked the story line and I thought the acting was good, especially that of the lead actress, who played a pretty French lady.  One character who should be dropped was a drunken Irish man who was the most vulgar of all.Please tell me that the pretty lady will strangle the Irish guy within the first five minutes of the next episode.  That done, I will watch the show.  Otherwise, it is not for me."
"We are drawn to end of the world/chaos type shows like a moth to a flame so we checked this out.  Can't even make it through the pilot, it's just too ridiculous.  Love the idea of it, but the execution of it is awful.  Things that happen are so unbelievable and the dialogue so hokey that it feels like a comedy or spoof.Things they could have done to make it better...not B movie it by going the whole hot chick with a gun and foreign accent routine and zooming in on her legs and chest any chance they could get. Made it about the plot, not looks or skin shots. Gave realistic dialogue and not clich&eacute; characters-every character in that parking garage is unrealistic and unbelievable.  And then (spoiler) the main female gets out and so does the bugged out eyed angry black guy and they are gone for an hour...but come back at the exact same time even though they aren't together?  And the dialogue was so cheesy there, this is the moment I had enough and turned it off."
"A silly zombie at the end spoiled it for me! Had promise with the disparate group of people facing the 'end of the world, but the zombie ruined it!"
"When I discovered Amazon launched a second phase of pilot, I thought this crop has to be better than the last (hey, you learn by your mistakes) especially with Netflix setting a rather high bar, but if this is the best of the lot then I'm afraid Amazon need to scrap their current selection process and build a better one.I came into this knowing absolutely nothing about it and groaned almost immediately. Bad acting, bad dialogue, bad accents, prehistoric racial and class stereotypes, and the dumbest decisions made by the blandest characters... this one has it all.So, after wasting nearly an hour on the most unrealistic reactions to a citywide disaster, and a ragtag group of characters banding together and STAYING together for no good reason, the show tosses in a***SPOILERS***birthday mystery and a demon with linking tattoos? As if that's somehow enough to to pull me back for the second episode? No way, no how.As when I finally discover this sub par mystery show was not only written but directed by Chris Carter, you could have knocked me over with a feather.How the mighty have fallen."
"It was confusing and boring to the end. At that point the spring out a green devil creeping creature.  No, it was not evens scary.  I would not watch this program."
"I don't know what to write. This show is bad. Corny dialogue, vague apocalyptic event that has caused mayhem in the world and uninteresting characters. Not for me."
Even with the best effort of suspended disbelief this is profoundly difficult to watch. The chaotic street scenario is so preposterous as is the rest of this exercise in an implausible circumstance followed by plot-line buffoonery of the highest order attempting to be a  scifi / doomsday disaster of a pilot episode.
"what a stinker.  no cars run, then they do.  People wandering all over FOR NO DISCERNIBLE REASON! It's not that the cars don't run, apparently, why are they all running around then?  No Reason. major reality challenging reveal in the ""Old Lady"" kitchen that they all immediately accept, and drop?  so dumb.And as I said elsewhere, remember that Carter's contribution to X-Files was the meandering, , pointless, lame, alien abduction mythos that interrrupted the finely written ""monster-of-the-week"" episodes.Carter didn't make X-Files good, it was good in spite of him.""The After"" has no angel."
"Bad acting worse story line, dump it now. Really, reallym, really, really bad! Do not waste your time. Please do not make this series."
"I'm not a science fiction or horror fan so my rating may be skewed a bit, but I really thought this show was terrible. First as an Irish American, I am insulted by the stereotype of the Irishman on the show. Not only was shown as a foul mouth drunk, but he states his drunken boorish behavior is acceptable in HIS country. If visited Ireland many times and the Irish do not suffer fools lightly. The only time I see the Irish behave like this is on an American television show. If Hollywood projected negative stereotypes on blacks, Jews or any other culture, there would be an uproar. I'm tired of it. I hope that your silly show fails."
"Stupid - plain and simple - having a car alarm constantly blaring in the background sent me scurrying for the remote after just a few  - relentless - minutes. Too insultingly stupid for my sensibilities. You want my attention for a series; then don't irritate me from minute one. I don't care what went after, I'm simply not interested in anything that irritating and completely unnecessary to the story, my interest, or cinema.So you want feedback -don't ever do that again!"
"I was expecting much more from Chris Carter.  After Breaking Bad, it's no question where the talent in the x-files really was..  The tone was uneven, the acting was mediocre, the writing was simple and humorless.  There was no subtext-- this is a step back in television-- the way it was in the 80's.To be honest, I stopped watching at the 33 minute mark.  I didn't care enough to watch any more, because with direction that bad, I knew whatever came after was sure to be disappointing."
"I got perhaps 10 minutes into...and stopped.  Not a chance I'm even going to finish it  I saw enough.The language is extremely offensive.  No, I don't have to watch this show...and I won't.The initial premise is intriguing...but sorry, I simply won't have that language shoved into my ears and mind in the name of &#34;art.&#34;There are more than enough TV-MA shows on television, we don't need still another such show pushing the boundaries/limits of what is considered &#34;acceptable&#34; TV fare.You want a hit show?  Clean this one up, and let it me something I can watch with my kids."
"Unless there is a significant twist to explain why the characters are acting in a way no real person would act (i.e. not understanding how a phone battery works), this show has no potential."
This show is so bad I gave up half way through the pilot.  It is illogical and foolish. Don't waste your time and Amazon should not waste their money to make this disaster.
"Bad acting, bad writing. Not a good combination for success. Couldn't bear to watch more than fifteen minutes. Another failure for Amazon Originals."
Not that good. Good acting and some big actors but all and all a weird show. Raised some interesting question in the pilot but don't think I would stick around to find them out.
I found the storyline boring. Every character has been done before & the combination of 8 different people thrown together is old.
"I really really wanted to like this pilot.  I love all things apocalyptic so I was super excited to see this in my list.  However, I only made it through maybe 20 minutes before I turned it off.  I don't know if the script sucked or the actors sucked but the line delivery was bad, the lines themselves were bad and I had zero investment in any of the characters.  There's the French actress with the perfect husband/child and flawless morals who also happens to be beautiful.  The rich old white lady who whines a bit much for my taste.  The expensive call girl who takes offense at being called a hooker.  The handsome attorney.  The incompetent Latina cop and of course, the black prison escapee who is brave beyond comparison, smart beyond belief and keeps his word when all others wouldn't have.....I waded through 20 minutes of bad character development and even worse plot development before I changed the channel.  Needless to say, I was disappointed."
I WANTED to like this show...until the &#34;black con&#34; started driveling about the &#34;black prison industrial complex.&#34; Can a few conservatives write a show for once?
This show was sad. The acting was horrid. The dialogue sounded like it was written by a high school student. Plus the plot is tired. Aren't there already enough shows and movies out there about the apocalypse??? This was definitely one of the worst that I have seen. A complete waste of 54 minutes.
"I watched 5 minutes and wished I didn't.  Then skipped around some.  Don't worry, don't bother.  It doesn't get any better.  I could provide more detailed reasons why.  But it doesn't deserve it.  Do yourself a favor and skip it."
"For those who like it, great. But there is absolutely nothing new or interesting. If you appreciate the innovative well written shows that we can watch on Netflix, HBO, etc., you won't last long on this one. If you love this show good for you, this is my opinion, you don't have to agree with me."
"I watched it I felt I wanted my money back...wait I did not pay anything for it and time does not come back. The plot is weak, saying the characters are one dimensional would be a compliment. I am not sure if there is a genre called 'dumb decisions horror' but if there was this one hit all the marks. The main character goes back to the hotel and does not consider wise to change her dress into something more appropriate for the end of the world? They run away from the cholos to hide in the forest? They look at the alien/mutant/demon and just wait for it to leave?  Oh, and it has all the same tattoos as well, I wonder why?"
"I'm sure everybody here is a good actor. But I couldn't get to the end. Boring. I don't know what it was but everybody except the wrongly accused convict seemed like they were overacting.  The French actress, the guy who kept cursing, the blonde and the lawyer. Terrible. I only got you the party where they get to the house but it was only because I fast forwarded the episode. Some of the things are ridiculous: why is the French actress using her phone when there's no electricity to charge it? What's the cursing guy frame of mind? There were a lot of other things in this episode that I didn't understand. This is the one of the pilots that I liked the least."
"This looks to be kind of like the X-Files.  People forced into a group fighting unusual events.  My feeling is that each week, another leaf of the onion will be pealed off with a never ending future.  I want a beginning, middle, and end of any series that I get involved in.  Not a beginning, and ad-infiniteum middle."
"Save your money on this one and stop it dead in its tracks.  The way overused plotline of, what will happen after..? is way too overdone and this one is so full of insulting stereotypes.  The writers clearly hype this as a mystery and I'll bet it's a mystery to them.  Where do they think they will go with this plotline..(plotline?  What plotline)?  Clown, elderly Jewish rich diabetic, trigger-happy black thug, no-talent actress with incomprehensible accent and good legs, all thrown together when the electricity goes off?  OMG, what will happen next?  No thanks.  I won't be watching to find out."
"With so many good shows out there about the end of the world as we know it (The Walking Dead, Revolution) and alien invasions (Falling Skies, Defiance), do we really need a poorly-scripted show with a few good actors given horrible and unbelievable roles?  I knew we were in trouble when the clown got onto the elevator.  It was all downhill (or down to the parking garage) after that.  Save your energy for the other new pilots. This one is a huge disappointment."
"This series is not well done there is no explanation to what is going on, what is that thing? Unatural, religious, ET?I just do not want to watch something religious, so I just think this is not for me."
"A desperate try to make an old story new. The pilot was so full of clich&eacute;'s it became laughable. In addition, I kept wondering why the people trapped in the car lot wouldn't attempt crashing through the gate with one of their cars. Please, a rich widow, a maid who gets forced into trying to rob her, a clown, a drunk, a mother worrying about her husband and child, a man who falls down and breaks his leg, bad writing, and no chemistry between the actors. All-in-all I'll give this show a try 'after' it is totally re-vamped."
"Really wanted to like this show, however, it just never came together.  Hard to care about people you wish would have died.  The only redeeming factor - the ending.  Sorry there are other MUCH better shows doing this type of stuff."
"I watched this show till the end because it at least, had some suspense in it. But as the movie was progressing, I started noticing the lousy writing and dialogue between characters. Then the blocking was stilted, then there was zero motivation as to why the characters were doing what they were doing~!yeck - no to this...."
A little too late...Chris Carter really went out on a limb with this one...all the characters were cliched and very unbecoming. The female French protagonist was so annoying while the Irish/Scot character was typical and flat.This is horrible...hope &#34;The After&#34; becomes &#34;The Never&#34;.
"Silly, rotten, stupid, what else can I say? LOST in LA. PLEASE don't waste your time on this piece of junk. Loved the X-Files. Forget this... please. I'll be royally annoyed with Amazon if they invest my Amazon Prime dollars in more of this garbage."
"If you're wondering what the hell my review has to with polar bears, you're either a Kevin Smith fan and immediately get it, or you're scratching your head wondering how that makes any sense.  Que up this show, and you wind up feeling exactly the same way, Denise Patterson's review summed up everything that I would've stated myself as to why this show was concocted by a bunch of nitwits.  Characters  you absolutely hope will die asap because that alone will increase the global IQ rating (except for Dee, the streetsmart black ex-con).  People rushing around aimlessly and having less than zero common sense, and the list of insulting (of the viewer's intelligence) goes on for a very long time.The ending features a undefined and unusual creature, perhaps a demon that's supposed to hook everyone, but sadly everything that led up to that point was so poorly assembled that one has no reason to waste another hour of one's life watching more of the same.  High school student plays are put together better, seriously this is just flat out awful.  My only sympathy goes to the actors and staff employed by this title, sorry to say but your agents should get fired for putting you into such a travesty of a show."
"You couldn't swing a stick without hitting a played out stereotype or trope that hasn't been done before - or a million times better. Poor writing, horrible acting, silly concept in general, the pilot had absolutely no direction, and poor production values. Tsk tsk."
"Here's an idea, Amazon:  if you're going to ask me to watch something and review it, don't lie to me about the rating.  On your website and on my Amazon app on Roku, the show's rating is listed as NR.  Then, when I start to watch it, it actually shows it to be rated MA.  Prior to popular belief, not everyone wants to watch MA shows.  I'm still of the belief that you can make quality programming without all the overt sexuality and profanity.  Because for this reviewer, I don't need or want that coming into my home and if it's on there, then I won't watch the show no matter how well-acted, written or directed.  So, here's an idea - how about making a show that is NOT an MA rating.  Or if it is rated MA, then list it that way so we know upfront.  And in case you didn't know, profanity is used by people of immature minds with limited vocabularies and no imagination.  You sent me an email and asked for my review.  Well, there you go..."
"Event. People wandering about. Event. People wandering about. Hokey dialogue. Event. People wandering about. Poor special effects. Event. People wandering about. Poor acting. More hokey dialogue. Event. People wandering about. Poor special effects. Event&#8230; Skip this movie, order a pizza and watch something else. Anything else."
"Seriously?  It opens with an insurance advertisement and then proceeds to one of the most poorly acted and utterly boring show pilots I have seen in years.  I turned it off after 15 minutes, but from what I could understand of that first boring intro, this is probably just a third-rate ""Lost"" knock-off, and I didn't really care for ""Lost"" either.  Instead of a crashed jetliner and a remote jungle island, this show features a stalled  elevator and a city parking garage.  The acting is the quality of a small town high school stage play.If you want something more interesting, I suggest that you just go to the local mall and watch the passersby.  Or maybe just buy an ant farm or some goldfish."
"We've done this to death and we're tired of &#34;what can it all mean?&#34; shows. Unless you say &#34;there will be x number of episodes and the story goes from A to B to C in that time,&#34; then you are just screwing with the audience and making things up as you go. Then you figure out that your series is ending (&#34;Oh, we've got to wrap this up&#34;) at some random point and just insert whatever plot points you need to tidy things up.ENOUGH WITH THE RANDOM MYSTERY GARBAGE!!"
"This show is just awful. I like a couple of the casting choices (e.g. actors from Heroes and Hustle), but the lines are so tired that even good acting can't overcome it.After about 30s of being trapped in an elevator, everyone is panicking?After an hour trapped in a parking garage, they're smashing car windows and acting like they're going to die soon? Then when they get out they've all somehow bonded to the point of sticking together?After a single day the entire city is in chaos and all the emergency responders have just nope'd out?All of this is not to mention the silly religious/science mixing and the over-the-top ending.Just...don't watch it. It's a poor imitation of Lost, with a worse setup."
"Bad acting, no plot to speak of, and God knows what THE BIG SECRET is. There is just no reason for this kind of junk."
I didn't care for the story line or the character dynamics. I feel that story had to much going on. I wouldn't watch the show if more episodes were made.
"really bad movie that got worse as it continued, by the time it neared the end it became agonizing, how this was ever even considered for a series is beyond me"
"I wanted to like this, I really tried. The first episode is tedious, dark and boring. After watching the entire episode I wished I hadn't bothered watching any of it. Jeffrey Tambor plays himself as he does in every role. The stereotypes are pathetic and the characters are not at all likable. Who wrote all the &#34;5 Star&#34; Reviews? I find it hard to believe that they watched the pilot."
"I found my self thinking 'get to the point already' half way through this thirty minute show. It felt too contrived trying too hard to be different. I did not feel a connection with these characters. In fact, I felt indifferent towards most of the characters. Frankly, I do not feel at all compelled to find out what happens next.  It's a shame because I really loved ""Six Feet Under"" and ""The United States of Tara"". I like quirky shows very much.  The acting was good but this show fell short. Sorry"
"Seriously! Who talks like that in front of a parent?! We tried to like it because of Jeffrey Tambor, but we couldn't even stay with it 'til the end. It was pretentious, and seemed like they weren't even trying to be entertaining."
I like Jeffrey Tambor and many of the other actors but the story was interesting.  Too many distractions and no point.
Stupid show. Not funny and weird. Do not even want to talk about it anymore but I want my vote to count.
"Some of the worst junk I've had the misfortune of wasting my time on. Couldn't make it halfway through. I HATED ALL the characters. Fire and blacklist the writers and actors! Surely there must be better available from ***Tube produced by fourth graders. Amazon, you should be ashamed of yourselves."
"Tries too hard to present characters that are complicated, but fails and instead we are presented with pretentious stereotypes who are just boring.  Comparisons with Arrested Development are likely, but the only thing it really has in common with that show is Jeffrey Tambor- who is also the only cast member with a shred of talent.Probably will get made just on Jill solloway's name...but if Amazon was smart they would bury this show six feet under!"
To each his/her own.I have absolutely no interest in following this series whatsoever.  It is listed under the genre of comedy but the humor is very dry to me.
"Given this was a pilot, I would think they are trying to put their best foot forward in order to get the powers that be to go ahead with production. Well all I can say is that if this was their best effort, this is a doomed undertaking. There was nothing about the characters that i found appealing and the plot was both slow moving and humorless. Better luck next time."
I did not care for it. A few minutes was all I needed to judge this show. Not worth my time.
"Poor writing, filming, acting, ...Unlikable, depressing characters. Just plain awful.Makes you wonder who is responsible for selecting the types of shows used in the pilot program."
"Yes, get the premise of Trans - Parent. But, cliched interactions between siblings and parents. Totally ridiculous plot line and obviously nothing in there that has any redeeming quality.Awful."
"&#34;comedy&#34; / &#34;drama&#34;  &#34; dramedy?&#34;  It wasn't very funny, it had a few surprise moments but they we're funny. Maybe as a drama, a really complicated version of parenthood, but it just doesn't work as a 23 minute comedy."
"Do we really need another show dealing with the superficial problems of the self-engrossed seeking pleasure and their disappointment with life not always giving them what they seek.  I have no need to see any more neurotic &#34;entertainment&#34;.  Please do not waste any more time, effort and money and end this with the pilot."
"I didn't like the subject.I didn't care for the characters.I like Jeffrey Tambor and Judith Light, but there talent is wasted in this show.If more shows are made, I will not be watching them."
"Very disappointing, boring and plain stupid. Amazon is much better then producing a show like this. We will not watch it."
What has happened? This was horrible -  This was offensive and I'm tired of unnecessary nude and sex scenes that have nothing to do with the storyline.  Urgggg
the show takes forever to get anywhere and when something in the plot actually happens it is not that great
Another show about how hard is to be white upper middle class in America. Is it about millennials? about old hippies? bisexuals? Not sure I can tell.
I watched the pilot but I wouldn't want to see anymore.  It did have good acting and some different characters but just wasn't my type of show.  It wasn't funny and even as a dark comedy it just didn't interest me at all.  The characters were some of the most boring I have seen and don't care about any of them.  Terrible show!!!!!!
It is just to far over the top for me. Everyone has gender issues. Not that realistic even though some of these issues must occur.
"I have to give this pilot a low grade.  This cannot hold a candle to the other Pilot programs that Amazon has out for review.Without divulging anything, we have a grown-up family. The father has an unusual perspective on his life.  The grown up children are all manipulative, and all with their unique life's' perspectives.This kind of sounds like a typical family with give-and-take between all participants.  Of course, no one should try to alter another family member's life's views.  Of course, that probably isn't what is going to be tried in future episodes.Been there.  Done that.  Bought the T-Shirt.  I think that Norman Lear's 'All In the Family' was better at this, and much more entertaining."
"I tried with this one - I really did, but I found it to be too long, drawn out, and boring. I found myself forwarding it, at times, but it never seemed to get any better. I wanted to find something to like about it, I really did, but it was just too slow for me, and I don't see this going anywhere. If picked up, it'll just be another show I won't watch. Sorry."
"Why? Because I used the words, they used in this movie.Sleaze, filth and foul- aren't my thing.Shame on the good reviews....I need 75-500 words for this review.  But since I couldn't choke the whole movie down because of offensive language and acts, I don't really see the need to even try.  I  doubt this 'review' will make it either.But if mother ------, is cool to you...you will like it.Very, very dissappointed in Amazon on this one..."
"Have to say I really liked the other 4 new ""pilots"" but this one is just not worth watching. I loved Oz, Shameless (BBC), Prison Break, the Sopranos and a host of other similar shows who certainly had some unpleasant characters but THOSE people were interesting and well written. Transparent has none of that. I do not understand the high reviews. For example: the family is sitting at a table and eating barbecue ribs. Each one of them has their face and hands liberally smeared with goopy barbecue sauce, as they chow down on the ribs.. One fellow has a beard with sauce all up in his beard. Nobody feels like they need to wipe. This is supposed to be funny.The best that can be said about it is that Transparent is boring. With a lot of 4 letter words."
Great idea to try bringing a very real subject to the screen.  However my house can not watch it because of all the nudity and the language.  If this is the type smut someone wants to watch then they should just subscribe to HBO.  Shame on Amazon on taking a subject like this and turning it into such a filthy environment that it can not be watched in mixed company with teenagers.  Or shame on anyone who thinks this show is appropriate for their family and their teenagers.  Clean it up Amazon and then perhaps it would be ok.
"Very ordinary. I wasn't impressed at all with the trailer at all. Characters were  not compelling, nor was the plot."
"Just not funny. Shows 5 different peoples butt (and trust me when I say, it's not attractive). Add that to awkward sex scenes and conversations"
"I love that Amazon took a chance with something like this.  I hate how bored I was.  5 minutes in I didn't have one chuckle one hint of anything funny.  The characters introduced at that point were boring.  I love Jeffrey Tambor too.  This show just doesn't work.  I have no problem with the idea of a family dealing with their father being Transexual.  This is really just about the writing (god awful), the pacing, etc.I thought this would be the best comedy of the 3, only to find out it was the worst.  While the one I thought would be worst was best.  If this gets made, it will show that the people behind it must have some good blackmail."
"I couldn't stand the characters on the show. None of them were likeable. The music on the show was decent, but that is about the only positive thing about the show. The pace of the show was too slow. I wanted to stop watching about ten minutes into the show. I just can't get into this show. It's too boring. I didn't find the &#34;humor&#34; funny at all. I would recommend skipping this show."
there is too much sex in the 1st show and not enough character development . It was easy to figure out what the father's was hiding and easy to know the 2 girl lovers from college would get together and I have no idea about the brother and the younger sister don't want to watch it again
"I don't know what people see in this one.  Provocative for the sake of being provocative, it seems, equals &#34;art&#34; these days."
"I love alternative shows, this one is just so poorly done.  An interesting concept, with great actors and acting and turned it into a distatsteful, boring, vulgar show.  I loved united states of tara and six feet under... too bad.  Aweful!"
"I didn't mind the slow pace ... liked the actors ... the story-line seemed promising ... until suddenly ... it wasn't.Storyline (spoiler alert) Paterfamilias calls his self absorbed children in for dinner and a family meeting.  They assume Dad has cancer and is going to die.  Before and after we see his son fondling his naked girlfriend ... his self conscious youngest daughter strip naked in front of her mirror ... his other daughter walking around naked from the waist down while brushing her teeth.  (None of this is easy to watch, funny or does anything to further the plot.Throughout dinner Papa's kids list numerous friends who have died and/or are dying of cancer.  (Not funny)  No one listens to anyone else.  (Sad, ugly and Definitely NOT funny)  Papa keeps trying to speak, but everyone is too busy saying why they believe Dad is dying.  (Not funny)Dad finally looses his cool and loudly proclaims he's cancer free.  (Awkward and REALLY Not funny)  He tries to speak his mind, but instead says he's leaving the house.  He tells one of his daughters he wants her to live in it, at which point his son throws a hissy fit because Dad didn't offer the house to him.  Absolutely NOTHING in this scene even approximated humor.The pilot ends with Papa's oldest daughter kissing and fondling her lesbian x-best friend in her Dad's bedroom.  (They both have money and own homes)  Why either one would do something this private in Dad's room is confusing at best.  The last scene has Dad walking in to his room dressed as a woman (what he had wanted to tell his kids about) and finding the girls together getting hot and bothered.If you enjoy mindlessly gratuitous nudity, meaningless sex acts performed in weird places for confusing reasons, and uncomfortable conversations about life, death, money and sex ... this is your show."
"It is filmed like a video camera follows a bunch of people through their ordinary lives. I kinda wanted to keep watching until &#34;smothering happened&#34; but couldn't make it past 7:16 into the episode. I am a patient person, known for my ability to wait for hours without problem. That I could wait for more that TEN MINUTES in this series... signifies disaster.  Yelch."
"Tambor is great as usual but isn't enough to save this one.. It had some nice comedic moments, but seemed to be trying to hard to be this artistic deep dark comedy, which to me just came of weird and a bit pretentious.  Pass on this one.."
Yuck!  This simply panders to what the writers think is fashionably LA perverse.  If it is by the creator of Six Feet Under then what happened?  That was a great show.  These characters have too much time on their hands. Pathetic!
"While I appreciate the Nudity, the rest left me wanting. The writing was good, but the story and characters didn't hook me at all. While the show as thirty minutes long, it felt like forty-five minutes, shows I like tend to feel the opposite."
"Didn't care for any of the characters except for the dad...sort of. The kids are incredibly annoying. He was just less annoying. Could be a groundbreaking series, but needs to be revamped. Start with better writing and an entirely new cast, save for the dad. I almost immediately figured out what the whole premise of the show was. I really didn't enjoy watching this at all. Like a lot of other reviewers stated, the episode seemed much longer than 30 minutes. I was completely bored the entire time. I'm not the prudish type, but I found the gratuitous nudity and sex scenes off-putting. They added absolutely nothing and weren't even mildly entertaining. Everything about this episode seemed contrived; nothing about it makes me want to see more. I feel like I was duped. I was expecting much better than this."
"Wow, nothing worse than watching family members fight and fight and fight.  That is all this show is about.  I could just spend time with my family and have a lot more fun."
What a waste of good talented actors.  Story line was so weak the we didn't even make it through half the show. Totally bored out of my mind.
"It has been done far too many times now; it is no longer (if it ever were) cutting edge.  A banal re-hash of &#34;dark, meaningful, intrigue and serious comedy&#34;; fairly well acted and designed but intensely boring (See! I can use ironic effect too!)."
This is a terrible show & I hope it doesn't see the light of day.  I think your exploration of sexuality is a big bust.  Trash this one immediately.
"YIKES!  Within 10 minutes it got weird.  Jeffery Tambor is a great actor, and does a great job, but this dark comedy is just odd and depressing."
Characters that grate and dialogue that annoys rather than entertains. Is this a comedy because a man in a dress is supposed to be funny (it's not)? Let's hope this one doesn't make it past the pilot.
"I didn't like any of the characters, and the plot was not very interesting.  Weird and boring are the words I would use to describe it.  I'll pass on this show."
"Dysfunctional people leading dysfunctional lives...again. No one to care about, no apparent point to anything, just more garbage on TV. Skip it."
I dud not like this movue st all.  I would not recommend it to anyone.I did nit enjoy the story.  Would not support the story line at all.
"I just couldn't get into this pilot at all.  The characters were not likeable and the story was very dull.  The humor is subtle to the point of non-existence, and I did not feel any connection to the characters at all.  It's a unique and clever premise, but I couldn't stand to watch this mundane sort of saga one minute more."
So much pain and struggle in a spoiled family...generation of denial of self...generation of over-indulgence and self-centeredness. I can't take another dose of dysfunction and suffering in the suburbs of too much of everything ville. A bit of good acting here and there if you like the distraught and maudlin.
"This show is trying too hard. I found it a mix of already popular shows (Modern Family, with a twist of Shameless), but it just wasn't working. I love Jeffrey Tambor's other roles, but I found him unbearable in this pilot."
Extremely boring and weird. It tries to hard to be unique and different without having any substance. In end I did not care for the show.
"&#34;Transparent&#34; is 1 of 2 of the new Prime series that attempts to combine a cutting edge topic with drama and way too much sex. I guessed from the beginning what the title referred to but that was not a turn off. Instead, it was just one twisted bad acted mess after another. It tied way too hard to combine the drama of HBO with the sex of Cinemax and failed at both. Jeffrey Tambor has much better acting in him than what I saw in this."
"Transparent tries to be both shocking and funny while being entertaining. Unfortunately, it's a modge-podge of depressing dysfunction.Cross-dressing and/or prepping for transition - not shocking or funny. Lesbian experimentation - not shocking or funny. Sleeping around - not shocking or funny. Depression - not shocking or funny. Self-loathing - not funny. Dysfunction and selfishness - haven't we all had enough of that in the real world? Seriously, watch the news and get a better laugh and more meaningful entertainment.There's nothing ground-breaking about this unless you've been living in a hole for your entire life. There's nothing uplifting, funny, or emotionally moving about this series at all, unless you want to include moving the viewer to a dark and depressing space. And, it's not depressing BECAUSE of the subject matter, but because of how poorly it's written, the lack of meaning, the lack of empathetic characters, and the over-induldged self-hating group of people who enjoy taking jabs at the people they're supposed to love.Pass on this one. It's a BOMB."
Watching this once was once more than I should have.  Is this the way people live in California?  No way I would watch any more of this.  Wish some of the stuff that was Transparent would have been more opaque
"and not funny enough to compensate for the dysfunction. I found it annoying, not engaging. Wouldn't watch it if it were a series"
I turned it off twenty minutes into it. I kept waiting for it to get better but it never did. And within twenty minutes it has to at least catch my attention and this on sadly did not. I don't even want to give it one star but I am sure that it will make me choose before I can actually post my review. Yep...right down there on the bottom of the review it says Star rating required. I want to give it a half a star then and only because I have to.
"This show is terrible and I didn't like one thing about it.  The story line is just messed up, and the show is just not appealing filming wise.  The show is just awkward to watch even alone.  The nudity is unnecessary and disgusting.  I didn't like the characters and they didn't do well together.  I recommend amazon to discontinue this idea."
"Out of all of the pilots, I would say this was the worst. The storyline was boring and weak.  I think that it had a hard time standing out against the other shows."
"Too many people with too many issues.  Way too many sub plots wandering around in search of a center.This is classified as a comedy and, assuming it hasn't been mis-classified, it fails dismally.  Not only did I not laugh, I never even cracked a smile.Reasonably good acting, good camera work, good sound.  But all for naught without a compelling story."
Didn't care for the show at all. It 's not uplifting and doesn't leave you wanting to see more. I was glad when it was over.
"Boring is the best thing I can say about this new series. Boring plot and characters, story line jumps all over the place.  Not something I would want to watch."
This may be a good show for an audience other than me. I just do not enjoy these multiple character personality interaction shows about family members.
I did not like it at all.  The characters are shallow and ridiculous. The situations that each one of them have to deal with are convoluted and artificial.  I find it depressing.
"I watched the pilot for 15 minutes waiting for it to develop, but it never did for me. The characters were predictable, the angst stereotypical. I lost paitence so I ended it."
"OK so naked butts we can take any time as long as there is a good story somewhere... But this show was lost btw naked boobs, butts, addictive behaviors for spoiled people..... (yup those with way too much time on their hands and way too much money)....There is bad and then there is really bad... This is a thumbs down, kill, erase from our memories bad."
I waited for 25 minutes for something to happen. Its like this show is trying to be edgy or trendy or appeal to &#34;hipster&#34; crowd. DO NOT....DO NOT make this show into a reality.
"I really did not like anything about this show.  The actors and their characters were aggravating, whiny, self-involved and colorless.  I had trouble finishing the 30 minute segment."
"This did nothing for me. Each character was more shallow and self-centered than the last. I didn't like the photography, the dialogue and I really didn't like all the naked butts. Not one of them had a nice ass (though the girl in the opening had nice tits)."
"characters are not written very well. it can be boring at times. The 3 siblings are not likable, we don't care about them. We have more empathy with the father. I don't think the show is headed in the right direction, it needs to create more emotional appeal to the audience. I feel like it's a forced decision to make the father dress up like a woman"
"I thought this pilot was awful.  I would never watch this series.  Only writers who lack imagination have to resort to such raunch.  Come on Amazon, let's see some substance.  Very disappointed."
"I loved Six Feet Under and The United States of Tara so I was ready to like this show, but I couldn't stand it.  There comes a point where the show transcends honesty and goes for weird and salacious.  The show was just strange and I didn't feel anything for any of the characters.  Not worth the bandwidth to download."
"Thank you, Amazon, for portraying a middle-to-upper class Jewish family in a dirty, gritty, yucky way.  Which next ethnic stereotype are you going to break?  Asians?  Are you going to do a series where they aren't cast as smart?I was drawn to this because of Jeffrey Tambor who always plays quirky characters with gusto.  He did not fail in his gusto for playing an advanced, middle-aged, bald man who is either a cross-dresser and/or wants to transition from male to female.  The three adult-children are all freaky and creepy.  I didn't like this for the same reason I didn't like the movie, &#34;August: Osage County&#34; -- while the acting was superb, watching a really screwed up family was beyond weary.Personally, I want shows that make me laugh (The Millers), make me happy (Glee), feel original (Seinfeld) (Glee), inform me (Jon Stewart), impress me with their acting (Big Bang Theory) (3rd Rock from the Sun).  This did none of the above.  I really don't want to see a married woman lusting for her college lesbian lover.  I don't want to see the son disrespecting women and doing whatever freaky thing that was alluded to in the mystery surprise scene.  I definitely want to remove the memory of Tambor in drag.This the 4th Amazon Original that I'm trying.  So far, Alpha House, is the only one that I like.  The rest will not bring me back for a 2nd viewing.  Oh, um, I probably will stop sampling these at 4.  I'm done."
"I didn't like any of these people, didn't care what happened to them or what will happen to them. just all so pointless and depressing without anything to actually interest me."
"Thoroughly unlikeable people behaving badly.  Poor production values. Not even remotely funny, interesting or  amusing. I would characterize this show as cringe-inducing.  Just generally awful."
"The plot seems to be a train-wreak set up for a completely dysfunctional family - if the gay agenda has not been pushed enough already, after watching this pilot episode, you will be screaming uncle."
"We couldn't even finish the pilot; didn't like, or care about, the characters. Heaven knows what it is about, but we do not care."
"I didn't care for the cast or the direction the series seemed to be going. The wife and I didn't care to watch it, and we like shows like parenthood etc."
Convoluted plotline of a dysfunctional family that takes it one step further.Into intimacy with gays. Very warm and fuzzy. Just a great show for children. Gives them something to strive for. Please put the show back in the closet where only night vision glasses would help.
This show was definitely not meant for adults but even kids shows should have some interesting points.  The characters even seemed to be uninterested to be in this show.  Wish I didn't waste my time watching it!
"All wrong for me not one thing I can say that I liked sorry. for those that did that is awesome I hope they make it so you can watch, just not for me."
"no plot, seems as if it will be a bunch of short stories in each episode. Made to order for kids under 12."
"Mind you I'm late 20's with no children. Though I enjoy the occasional Disney show or movie. I just could not find anything enjoyable in this, it was like a b movie, I thought it was over acted and far to serious."
I tried to give this pilot a chance just like I did with a few of the others and this one did something that the others did not...bored me from the beginning.  The show &#34;The After&#34; and &#34;The Rebels&#34; caught my attention from the very beginning while &#34;Gortimer Gibbon's Life on Normal Street&#34; lost me immediately.  The writing wasn't as great as the other shows and while Fionnula Flanagan is quaint as Miss Hudspith and Robyn Lively is more beautiful than ever the rest of the show has its flaws.  The children in the show don't have the ability to deliver the so called &#34;punchlines&#34; and there is just no chemistry.
I didn't like that so many stereotypes were used. The smart boys were inept socially while the main girl character does not have a high IQ but does have a high EQ (Emotional IQ). This is playing too much to stereotypes. I also didn't care for some the language: i.e. &#34;brain fart&#34; and &#34;wedgies&#34;. I'm glad I watched this before considering showing it to my daughter and son. Needless to say my children will not be watching this show.
"Best part of it was the classical music.  Not a terribly likeable bunch of characters.  Granted it might get better, but I gave up after the first 10 minutes of it."
"Not At All Interesting, Highly Inaccurate, Offensive to Real Musicians -- Seriously, you have better things to do with your time, and there are plenty of other things to watch in this genre."
"Stupid, crude, cliche about God knows what. I didn't know that cellists were that horny. Terrible waste of talented actors like McDowell and Peters. Dump this one, it's awful."
Watched only a few minutes of this pilot and didn't like any of what I saw. OK if you're into a lot of classical music I guess.
"What a bunch of crap this program is.  The best original programming Amazon has produced to date, and it isn't saying much, is the Bosch pilot.Could only watch 15 minutes of this 30-minute pilot and wanted to stop at 10 minutes, but thought I would go for another five, just in case things improved, but they did not.Everything about this TV show (compared to so much available content out there) reeks of mediocrity, including the writing and acting!"
"I would love to know who the brilliant person was who decided this needed a pilot, they must be on some good drugs. What would be the plot lines progression from sad pilot in new episodes? This show right from go was a snore.. I don't think anyone is waiting to watch Malcolm and Bernadette on a weekly basis? Saffron's character was hey I am a slut. The music made me want the characters to put their instruments in their happy places like American Pie. Gael is not well known.The younger cast was just tri-hard and failing.The only laughs was the kid getting lessons.If this is voted in people be cra cra'!"
I watched about half the show and couldn't finish watching.  It had some good actors but it just wasn't very interesting.
"From what I saw in the preview, I have no intention of watching more of Mozart in the Jungle.  Too confusing and dark."
"We couldn't finish the 26 min episode (stopped 12 mins in). It was just too unnecessarily vulgar. I guess some people will tune in just for that. To each, their own"
Sorry but I've watched all 5 of the Amazon pilots and this one not only put me to sleep but I just couldn't even finish watching it.
"So you throw drugs, alcohol, one of the best actors of all time (Malcolm McDowell), and some of the best music ever produced, and you still can't make this show work.  It is boring, has a lame script, terrible dialogue, but I think it's getting traction because of high production values and big names attached.  Bosch, Transparent, and even &#34;the &#34;After&#34; deserve to be carried by Amazon more than this title."
I couldn't get past the first 15 minutes which to me is the &#34;grab us&#34; part of a storyAlso the F bomb is just said to often.
"Could be an interesting topic, but, like so many shows out there now, it basically just throws a bunch of meaningless sex, profanity and non-likable characters at you. Too bad - the subject matter is pretty unique and could have been developed into an interesting storyline, but I'm just so sick of everyone sleeping with everyone else and not caring...same old, same old."
"Reminded me of the show girls on HBO. Just recycled ideas, played out by helpless characters, on their way to mediocrity."
"The following is taken from the comments I made on the survey. &#34;Mozart&#34; was a huge disappointment on all fronts except for Malcolm McDowell and even this script is far from being suited for his best work. I had hoped for some good music and some drama and received only a lousy plot, bad acting and a show that tried to combine HBO drama and Cinemax, almost creepy, sex rolled into one."
"I thought this might be amusing, but I found it a bit ridculous. As with many shows - with the exception of a few masterpieces ( breaking bad, true detective, even hannibal) most of what is out there is so cliche and predictable. This show is all of those things AND the acting is pretty bad and it's boring."
Please don't waste your money and our time. Move on to a better story. This show is horrible and can't get any better.
"Out of all of the new shows that debuted on Amazon pilot series, this was the worst. It was slow, way too cliche (underline, underline), boring plot, annoying sex scenes, cursing where it doesn't belong. No likable characters except for both of the maestros. I kept waiting for the scenes/show to pick up and get better. It did but it was the last 5 minutes of the show. Would not watch any more of this series."
"So what is this? A comedy? A drama? A dramady? A insider's look at classical music? What? Aside from ridiculous, what was the intention behind this show? That is my question.1) Look, I am pro-sex, nudity, and all kinds of grown up things that people do with their bodies. But seriously, did the pitch for this show go this ... &#34; There are instruments and an ingenue and sex is literally everywhere. It's just sex and instruments - it's just so so sexy.&#34; But it's not sexy. That's the problem. Putting sex in every scene or talking about it in every scene does not make a show sexy. Not that I am even pretending that this show has any viable premise whatsoever. It doesn't. There is just so much to write about - if your topic is in fact New York musicians - that I can't believe you made the most boring/silliest show that I've seen [from Amazon].2) The characters are all caricatures. The conductor actually has ringlets [like Shirley friggin Temple - RIP] and dresses like he's going to a costume party. There is absolutely no one who would think he's credible, especially over Roddy McDowell in NY or music or anywhere else but a loony bin. No one.3) There is a hot female cellist - whose only purpose seems to be to have sex with people or encourage other people to do so. I just don't understand her point. We get it already. This is a sexy show. You don't need someone/her to say it in EVERY scene.4) What a waste of Bernadette Peters.5) I couldn't tell you where this show is going after the pilot, nor do I care. None of the characters seem anything more than a stereotype or some odd cartoon or likable, for that matter.6) Gabriel Garcia is just awful. I suggest a major re-write, re-cast or make sure this character is killed off before you continue. You can probably run over the cellist too - unless you intend to give her more to do than give blow jobs. I hear she's an actress, you might start there...It's too bad. New York is an interesting place. And I haven't met a musician without an interesting story to tell. Did you even attempt to talk to anyone who actually knew anything about New York or musicians? It doesn't seem so.My problem is not the sex. My problem is there is no story, no one to root for, no characters that seem like there was any thought put into them... There is just no show here.This is just silly, ill-conceived, nonsense that should have NEVER made it past any decision-maker. Ever."
"This show had such promise & possibilities...UNTIL I watched it. It fell apart fast. It just fails on so many levels. Sex, drugs and Classical music... hmmm.. how novel. Clean-up the scripts, get rid of the gratuitous cussing and substitute find intelligent repartee (see Frazier for the template). I have sympathy for the cast that has to try to make something of this woeful script."
"What?  Is it over?  What was it about?  I think I fell asleep.  Yawn.  Um, it was boring.  It was shallow.  It was vulgar.  No more AMAZON ORIGINALS FOR ME.  I don't understand all the positive ratings.  These shows seem to be written by a graduating class in Series Writing where they were given a formula and told to go out there and shoot a pilot.Here's your formula:  SHOCK, SEX, GREAT SCENERY, BEAUTIFUL YOUNG ACTORS, STIR IN SOME TOP TALENT, THROW IT ON THE WALL and SEE WHAT STICKS."
Worst series I have sampled lately.  Plot made no sense. Abandoned it after less than 10 minutes.
This was a terrible show. Didn't laugh once. Horrible characters. Stupid plot. Waste of time. And why does the constant dropping of the F-bomb strike this show's writers as funny? Natalie Zea should go back to Justified and forget this disaster ever happened.
"Poor attempt. Seems like they were trying for a cross between 1st & Ten and Major League. Bad story, bad acting. Hard to get through the pilot. Thought Amazon was trying for &#34;original&#34; programming."
"Again, I did not like the start and could care less about the characters. There was nothing to draw me in."
Not cool.  Love the lead actress.  Just not into this type of comedy.  Sorry Amazon.  I am required to write more words so let me just say that I don't want to watch the next episode.  I didn't even finish the pilot.
I didn't care at all for the plot or the acting. This is not a show that I would ever watch any episodes.
"C'mon Amazon!  You gave me Alpha House and Betas.  This is just bad.  Stereotypes abound!  The opening was lame.  The premise is lame.  The actors are walking through their parts.  Sorry, but I couldn't handle more than 10 minutes of this tripe.  NEXT."
"How many sports programs can you say are successful? EXACTLY!!! &#34;YPB&#34;  It's your problem bro, as the character says in the show! Monkeys and cocaine taking left overs from the Hang-over franchise is real sad! Natalie is kind of hot right now, this show is not the get ahead for her! Are Amazon's viewers sports fans, enough to carry a whole season?"
"I wanted to like this show, but the cliche &#34;woman&#34; doesn't know anything about football&#34; to the overuse of curse words just made watching this extremely uncomfortable. The Plot ok, the jokes &#34;meh&#34;, and usual/ completely obvious twists made this boring. Definitely made for a younger, immature, sexiest, and uneducated audience."
I tried watching and couldn't even finish watching.  It just wasn't very funny and not interesting at all.  I finish watching all 5 new pilots and this might be the worse one of the five.
"After watching Transparent, I thought we were in for a really quality set of pilots this time around, but The Rebels brought me crashing down to earth. Natalie Zea is great but she deserves better than this. Everything about it is derivative, from the drugged-up monkey (which made me cringe) to the stereotyped people of color to the aging quarterback giving it one last shot. The idea that a woman being in charge of a football team is enough of a story in itself to build a TV show around might have been revolutionary in 1987, but it turns out, women like sports too. If you're a total bro who thinks the N-word is funny and loves nothing more than a simian in a diaper, you'll probably love it. But that's not a compliment."
I only made it 6 minutes into the show before turning it off.  Seemed like it was a good idea when I read about it but the language was terrible.  I can't watch this show with family around.
After hearing the curse word MF in the first few scenes I trashed it. Not worth watching in my opinion!
"I think this is supposed to be a comedy?  I wasn't quite sure since there were a couple funny lines, but not anything to make me laugh a lot.  The plot was really dumb, and the characters were typical stereotypical characters.  How many times are we going to see a soccer player as the kicker in football?  Geesh.  I'll pass on this show."
"Wow...how utterly dumb and annoying. It seems no one can write a good, smart comedy anymore. Too bad. I like the lead actress (was great in Justified), but she's not doing herself any favors in this dud. Bad writing, not in the least believable subject matter...don't waste your time."
Everything about this show was boring and predictable. I watched about half-way through and started falling asleep. Natalie Zea is pretty though.
I couldn't even get all the way through it. I was not impressed at all. They should toss this one.
"REALLY badly written.... actors seem rather embarrassed to be there throwing these lines.  premise isn't bad, but this is a fumble from the snap.  they need to find the handle on the ball on this one."
"Ugh! Predictable and brainless. There isn't one chracter on this show that was in any way likable. And the coke-sniffing, gun-toting monkey was utterly stupid. Do not waste your time on this one. Maybe if they gave the monkey a typewriter it could have come up with a better story!"
"It's so bad, it's not even worth the effort to write a bad review. Unoriginal. Uninspired. Unfunny. Such a waste of talent."
This pilot was so boring that I only watched about 10 minutes of it.  The whole &#34;fish out of water&#34; storyline has been done better with better actors then these.
"I've seen some really poor shows and this one is among the poorest ever. It is shallow, course, stereotypical and demeans women and athletes. I found nothing to like.. so can this and find something else .. oh, here's and idea. Make a prison comedy 30 minute tv sitcom  (NOT).."
The crazy players are one-dimensional and the lovable happenstance GM seems like this is the role he always gets stuck playing. It just tries too hard and is too predictable. The only thing evenly slightly funny was the monkey snippet during the credits.
"idiotic comedy not interesting at all. Under developt characters, there is no reason why she should keep th team. Very predictable,"
"There is NO way a professional football cheerleader who ends up marrying a team owner would call football uniforms, &#34;costumes.&#34;That's when I knew these writers were trying to insult human intelligence.It sunk when they portrayed the football players, most of them black, snorting coke (at a black team player's house / party) and letting loose a rented monkey who ends up snorting coke and shooting a Latino place kicker in the foot.  Guys (football player actors) where's your ethnic dignity?  Don't do this to yourself and your people.Yuck.  The show was beautifully shot but the story and the stereotypes sunk to low levels."
"nope, so not for me. can't stand football and I'm just irritated at the thought of a someone keeping a monkey for a pet."
"Waste of decent actors in an overly broad, unfunny comedy.There is no reason for this mediocre, derivative show to exist. It is too reminiscent of USA Network's UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS, even going as far as to steal the joke about confusing football uniforms with costumes in that show's pilot.  Natalie Zea is given horrible material as a scatty heroine barely a few steps away from being a bimbo.  The other characters are stereotypes: the wimpy new manager who rises to the occasion, the goofy but sincere screw-up player, the semiretired quarterback who needs a comeback set up as a potential love interest for the heroine, the sexist businessmen trying to buy the team. Awful, predictable dialogue and outcomes you see coming a mile off.The attempts at humor are too broad and unfunny, with every single point in the story telegraphed from way off as if the show was afraid we're too stupid to keep up.This is probably worst of the new pilots."
Rich bitch suddenly owns a football team and calls uniforms &#34;costumes.&#34; That sure sounds like a laugh riot to me.
I think this is a twisted mind's series. It has little appeal to me. I do not have anything of value to say about it.
"I suppose it might help if you've read the books, which I also imagine to be slow and boring.Nothing about this show makes me want to watch another episode.  The actors are great, the dialogue is okay.I couldn't believe someone actually wrote the line for the Internal Affairs guy to point his finger at Bosch and pull the 'trigger'.This show is a zero."
"Beyond slow paced, boring and cliched, is it sponsored by tobacco companies?  A jarring amount of cigarette smoking in the first 15 minutes.  Didn't finish watching it.  Watched a third and it just never got any better.  How is it getting the good reviews?  Mystery to me.  Got to be mighty bored to be entertained by this."
I fell asleep watching it and won't watch anymore episodes if they decide to make more.  What I stayed awake for seemed to be well made though.
"Bored me from the beginning.  Will not match another crime show.  It didn't keep me up, stopped watching it after 20 minutes."
The lead is a depressed bore and the other characters are stiff and cliche. The LA setting is done well but that is about it
Another show extolling the virtues of addiction and self-abuse.  I hate watching train wrecks and people hurting themselves and this show is nothing but that.
A big Yawn. A standard police drama without an interesting hook. Titus Welliver is a wonderful actor that deserves stronger story lines.
"Com'on people. We have all the CSI's, USA shows, justified, list goes on and on. Show is predictable and is more at home on a cable television channel"
Really did not care for the show. The character was robotic and lacks emotions. Hope this show does not make it over the other shows.
"Come on Amazon,..Some of us don't like HD, when are you going to make this available for those of us who would rather see it in SD,.At this time, we have no choice !!!"
"I've tried several Amazon series, and each one has too much swearing.  Right off the bat, this one has swearing.. literally in the first sentence!  That is such a turn off!  Every sentence after that is much the same.  I finally couldn't take it anymore.  I'm completely done with Amazon series.  Disappointed."
"Here's an idea, Amazon:  if you're going to ask me to watch something and review it, don't lie to me about the rating.  On your website and on my Amazon app on Roku, the show's rating is listed as NR.  Then, when I start to watch it, it actually shows it to be rated MA.  Prior to popular belief, not everyone wants to watch MA shows.  I'm still of the belief that you can make quality programming without all the overt sexuality and profanity.  Because for this reviewer, I don't need or want that coming into my home and if it's on there, then I won't watch the show no matter how well-acted, written or directed.  So, here's an idea - how about making a show that is NOT an MA rating.  You know, not all of us think the use of the &#34;f&#34; word is quality writing.  You sent me an email and asked for my review.  Well, there you go..."
"Whoever wrote this script needs to spend more time taking writing courses and/or reality courses.The entire plot oscillated between silly, dumb and making no sense. Why put an old skeleton key (looks like it would only fit old doors or old cabinets) in some really fakey mechanism inside an extremely expensive grand piano? Why not just break into the cabinet (or whatever the key fits) directly without having to go through all this elaborate, low probability, highly unpredictable caper. Or, just break into the piano. Or, just have the pianist play it at some other time like at night. Or, build a small mechanical device to play four notes. The whole laser, cryptic notes, ear phones, accomplice, murders, ending tussle, and then falling 60 feet destroying a piano and his hair looked as perfect as the first scene - all of it was just, Huh? Forgot, the movie is full of red laser pointer dots and beams. Are the several hundred people in the darkened hall blind?What wasted potential!"
"Tom (Elijah Wood) is married to movie star Emma (Kerry Bish&eacute;). They are the annoying type of people who walk around with a phone in their ear. In Florida it is almost legal to kill them. He &#34;choked&#34; the last time he played the piano...five years ago. He flies to Chicago (from London?) changes in a limo on the way to the concert hall, goes on stage with an orchestra he hasn't played or practiced with in five years and is afraid of choking. Seriously? I can't brush my teeth right after a good jet lag.Now as he starts to play, he gets the message that if he misses a note, he dies...or Emma dies. Neither one was likeable and this was the scenario I was hoping for. So after 20 minutes, I kept wondering, &#34;Is this going to be the whole movie?&#34; 40 minutes go by and this is still the freaking film. At 55 minutes we get a clue as to why this was going on. I really didn't care at this point, I just wanted to see Tom and Emma die a horrible death for talking on their cell phones all the time.How long is John Cusack on the screen? Don't ask.I don't understand the rave reviews. It doesn't keep you on the edge of your seat. A boring &#34;thriller.&#34;"
"It is not funny in the least. No real imagination leads to no real laughs. Each episode is the same...grownup disregards boy, boy gets his feelings hurt, grownup redeems themselves. Very formulaic. Hollywood at it's worst."
First off Jackie Christie is such a fake and this season she has found her some minions to follow her and a couple of them must have a little bit of hood rat in them.  I watched 2 shows and decided that this season is a waste of time so I won't be renting any more.  Maybe next season you will bring back some of the original cast and it will be worth watching.  Please get rid of Jackie.
That is really how bad the show is. It's so bad that I'm speechless. I only watch this show when I have nothing else better to do. &#34;BLAH&#34;
What the hell?  This video was an acrobat show.  I wanted to see PINK from the start of her career when all the dance hits made her.  This new stuff sucks.  If you're into the new PINK...this is right up your alley if you have an alley?  If you prefer the older more hip hop version of her you can forget it.  What she does sing from the good ole' days is butchered to the new PINK style.  She could have at least mixed up a little old with the new.  For me this was lame.  She's long ago forgotten what music really made her famous.  So sad. You can tell she owns stock in SPANKS. LOL
"I am HAUNTed by the fact that I just spent $7.99 to rent this movie!!!! Scroll away from the purchase page as fast as you can and DO NOT think twice about it!!!! If Amazon put this movie on a stream free give away I would still NOT recommend it, and would suggest that you flee from it because I would NOT want to be responsible for the curse of sorrow that you watching this movie would bring you!!!! Nuff said!!!!"
"I'm ticked off big time!!!! A friend of mine said I needed to watch the comedy &#34;The fart of the seal&#34; and everybody knows that farts are funny, so I went to the video store and asked for &#34;The fart of the seal&#34; and they handed me this movie, and when I watched it I did not see even one farting seal!!!! This is the last time I take movie suggestions from that friend!!!! Geezzow!!!!"
"The pace ... omg ... slow, slow, slow, glacially slow...soporific.  And the images ... a naked woman in a bed of black satin sheets ... one drop of blood?  Please -- every lame vampire book on the market has that one on the cover.  Lots of  talk about sex and death and the psyche.  Most of which is silly and lame.  Pretentious.  Dull.  Not worth a penny.  I hope all of the characters find a creative way to eat each other until all of them are dead."
"The creators of this show are certainly not trying to reel in viewers with the first show. It is slow moving and dull. This show won't get another season, I can promise you."
Low budget not worth the time to watch. Wasted the money to buy it. We didn't even finish pilot show
At first I thought it would be a mad max type of movie but it wasn't at all interesting or my type.
Total waste of time and money. Didn't laugh ONCE! Story was TERRIBLE. Acting was good- it was a waste of the actor's talent.
"January is always the worst month of the year for an avid moviegoer like thornhill. The studios are too busy promoting the wide releases of their Oscar hopefuls to concentrate on new films they have any hope for. As a result, January is a dumping ground for bad films they can't wait to write off. But Big Hollywood still hopes they can bilk an unsuspecting public out of a few million dollars before the release ends up in streaming and free cable hell.Because &#34;That Awkward Moment&#34; is a quote-unquote romantic comedy and it is being released two weeks before Valentine's Day, I held out some hope for it. That, and the fact Zac Efron seems to be enjoying a bit of a renaissance since leaving rehab &#8211; he is in a lot films &#8211; seemed to indicate the film might be better.But &#34;That Awkward Moment&#34; is full of, well, awkward moments that were funny the first five times we saw the same jokes in other films and television shows. Now, one hundred times later, the jokes are boring and routine. These jokes are now so familiar they have been relegated to bad television sitcoms.Zac Efron and Miles Teller play Jason and Daniel, co-workers and best friends, who meet regularly with Mikey (Michael P. Jordan, &#34;Fruitvale Station&#34;), a doctor who discovers his wife is cheating on him - to discuss girls, dating and their conquests. They talk about every part of their sexual conquests, their penises, their bodily functions, etc. They talk a lot about things I find it hard to believe three straight guys pursuing relationships with females would talk about.Eventually, they make a pact to stay single as long as Mikey is single. Given the predictability of THIS quote-unquote romantic comedy, you already know what that means; one or more of the guys will immediately fall in love with a girl and try to hide it from the others. Strangely, the filmmakers views these relationships as an excuse for the three guys to get together and talk more. The story doesn't really shift to the new male-female relationships. Essentially, this is a quote-unquote romantic comedy about three guys.That might work, if the film were in better creative hands. Written and directed by Tom Gormicon, whose only other credit is &#34;Movie 43&#34; &#8211; the worst film I have ever seen &#8211; nothing in &#34;That Awkward Moment&#34; is original or seems remotely real or true. That's too bad because you get the sense the filmmakers are trying for so much more. Which makes &#34;Moment&#34; an even bigger disappointment.And it's too bad for Zac Efron who is a really handsome, really terrible actor &#8211; he has the looks of a matinee idol but he just can't act. When he works with more talented directors, he does a better job. But in &#34;Moment&#34;, his character just seems like a jerk, the whole time, and never really changes.Miles Teller is basically the comic relief and Michael P. Jordan plays the 'real' member of the trio. He is going through a real-life situation. But they don't, or can't, overcome the clich&eacute;d story, bad direction and stilted acting of the lead.Imogen Poots plays Ellie, the object of Jason's affections. She must be the next &#34;It&#34; girl, because she is in a lot of movies coming out this year. She doesn't earn that title with this performance. She is good, OK, acceptable, but because she has to play against Efron, her performance fails to register.&#34;That Awkward Moment&#34; is bad. And it will surely end up on a lot of &#34;Worst of 2014&#34; lists."
"I'm so glade that I didn't spend 4 bucks on this movie I caught it on Netflix . I was so board to the point where I fell asleep if your expecting gore keep moving , if you're expecting zombie action keep moving, if you're expecting a good movie period keep moving. Folks please do not waste your money this movie isn't nearly worth it trust me. If I could give no stars it wouldn't show!"
Just disn't have anything new to offer other than the fact that the main character is a &#34;cutter&#34; which made her just a bit more interesting. Ireally like The lead actress.
"Oh my goodness, this show is bad. I thought maybe because chloe sevigny was in it, it might be good. It's all bad detective cliche with NOTHING redeeming , except maybe good fodder for satire. So, so very bad. Why, with shows like Hannibal and true detective, do people still make shows this bad? I don't get it."
"The first season was great... this one is dominated by tired, boring dialog in Russian with subtitles. The main, interesting characters are ignored as the writers go on and on about stupid, boring plots... while the original ideas for this great show get lost.Yuck. Cancel my season pass.... I'm done."
This is a terrible movie after watching it I wished I had not wasted the time.
"Dialogue & acting - dialogue is changed from 1st century Italian into 18th century old English by Hollywood. A common dialogue found in many of their period movies no matter what century or country. Acting was daytime soap TV level.Characters - noncreative, plug and play characters e.g. gladiators (one black), soon to become friends with main character (done before); his counterpart sees his parents die at Roman hands and is now old enough for revenge (done before); evil Romans acting badly; aristocratic pretty daughter (still has 21st century make up, eye liner, etc.) falls for  gladiator (of course).Action scenes -  good gladiators defeat dozens of Romans as brunch (I was waiting for one hand tied behind the back and blindfolded but the writers copped out). Not realistic.CGI - flashes of CGI volcano every 5 to 10 minutes to remind us of what the movie is about. Familiar scenes of water rushing over the city - already used in many tsunami movies. Looked like the same wave used in several recent Indian Ocean tsunami films, but not as well done as say in ""The Impossible"". Comical volcano Roman Candle fireworks fireballs."
"Cheese, cheese, cheese, and more cheese than you ever imagined was possible in a short few hours of cheese.  Cheese."
"I am a big movie fan.  Love movies and go regularly.  I had high hopes for Pompeii, but about 30 minutes in I realized this was a real turkey.  There was nothing factual about it, nothing that I could see.  A stupid love story was the focus of the story, while a volcano was coincidentally erupting in the background.  I cannot recommend this flick unless you choose to sit down and smoke a little pot and watch it with friends who have great senses of humor."
I can't really give an honest assessment because I shut it off after 30 minutes. But I can honestly feel good about myself for doing so in that I saved an hour of my life from witnessing this sad car wreck of a wannabe scifi horror thriller.
"This whole season is a overlong, tedious remake of the movie. Anyone who would be interested in the series has already has already seen the far superior movie. It should have either done the movie in the pilot and given us new material from then on, or just started up after the incident at the bar in Mexico. It has that weird pacing and dialog of a Rodriguez/Tarentino movie, sort of: its too slow. You need to really be in the mood for this type of picture.I would not recommend this entire series as is. It is a great idea, has RR doing the directing, etc. but it doesn't click."
"I swear nothing original out of Hollywood in several decades. So you took the movie &#34;From Dusk Till Dawn&#34;, remade it, then split it up into several parts and made a TV series out of it!? OMFG Why!? I saw the original a million times so I'll be damned if I pay for 7-16 episodes of a crappy remake where I KNOW whats going to happen next. These are some whack ass actors too, dude is NO George Clooney & the nutcase is NO Quentin Tarantino  *LoL*....... I guess season 2 will be a remake of &#34;From Dusk Till Dawn 2&#34;  split into 16 episodes and season 3 will be &#34;From Dusk Till Dawn 3&#34; split into 21 episodes. HA! Pathetc....DISCLAIMER: Being that Amazon &#34;comments section&#34; is becoming too much like YouTube comments due to ignorant people with no lives, I have to make this disclaimer. F_ _ _ YOU in advance to anyone that feels the need to criticize my review, as well other peoples review. I turned the &#34;notification&#34; feature off a long time ago because I couldn't careless about anyone's feedback. So your stupid commentary WILL fall on deaf ears. So STFU in advance also. Have a good one : )"
"The radio station hostage script has been done a few times before - some with funny intent, some tragic. This script started out with a bit of creative dialogue such as the following, which I enhanced a bit: ""Easy way to solve their problems, Judaism & Islam, is to merge the two and they can gang up (declare war) on what they both hate - pigs; we'll call it Jislam.""Well, from that high point onward it was just stereotypic narcissistic, self-aggrandizement and predictable, railing against the boss, hostage taking.What made the movie really uncomfortable is knowing in the back of my mind all the hostage taking with tragic consequences that have recently occurred in schools in the US and in countries such as Nigeria and Iraq. The plot makes light of all, similar events - difficult to justify a script knowing all of that."
"But hey, Amazon only charges $100./yr for &#34;Prime&#34; membership to watch all the trash we wish for no extra fee!This is the last time I'll be signing up for it."
Really bad. Couldn't get past first few minutes.
"What a fake boring waste of time.  Seems like its scripted with bad acting.  Won't ever watch again.  Maybe he should get wife #6 and get rid of these, lol"
"This show is poorly made, unprofessional, and boring. The host seems to barely know what he is talking about, and the content is filled with speculation and rumors. Don't waste your time!"
Too many sharks jumped in first three episodes
"Well, this show started out okay, but has now degenerated into the &#34;pin it on Mark Valley&#34; hour. The network can end this tragedy at any time and I will miss it not one bit."
I don't know what the muck these people were thinking when the funded this movie. What a bunch of muckups!
"Might have been fun for them to make, but I couldn't sit through more than 15 minutes of it. Indie bad."
Boring sad women some need meds and others ( turtle time) had plenty.  By the way Mario is a supercilious snake who ain't all that and a bag of chips.  Thank you for the vent  Carla Tamari
"I admit to watching it over the years, but it has hit an all time low.  Ramona's behavior is oddd and we are tired of it.  You should have kept some of the other women versus her when you made firings."
"Pretty regular network attempt at entertainment... Bland indeed, lacking any sense of risk taking. Won't last long at all on TV"
"We're only two episodes into this new NBC drama and it's already fallen apart at the seams. The show opens with Cuaron's directorial trademark of a technically clever tracking shot and after that it devolves into an incredibly dull series of totally unbelievable chases with absolutely zero character growth or plot development.The girl is blessed with some sort of telekinetic capability that she uses whenever the plot needs an escape catch. With this superpower, she should be the least vulnerable human on the planet but instead succumbs to an inept series of bad guys who can't decide whether to capture or kill her. She also seems to &#34;sense&#34; people's problems to get the B plot of the week going so she can run around helping people in between the good guys messing things up.The writing is on par with a first draft from a mediocre screenwriting student at a bad film school and it's almost inconceivable it was used for production. Every scene is littered with exposition throughout the script (&#34;You're a prisoner on deathrow and face execution.&#34; / &#34;You were trained at Quantico and now you're working on the Tate case&#34;). Hardly anything is said that isn't trying to explain the derivative back stories to the audience to the point where I'm screaming at the TV every time somebody utters one of these inane lines.The bad guys have a near-telepathic capability of knowing where she is at all times and the good guys do the worst job possible in keeping her out of harm's way, except when they use their own near-telepathic knowledge to protect her. The script conveniently forgets everything that goes before it (hey, there's a bag of money on a  fire escape in New York that's still there) and gives the audience no idea of where it's going beyond &#34;we're going to the safe house&#34; or &#34;we're going to Philadelphia&#34; - why not let's go to Disneyland and at least have some fun? Oh, and then major characters disappear - the laughably bad assassin from the pilot presumably didn't test well with the audience, even though they were the least demanding audience in history for liking the rest of the show.All the drama is developed from a simplistic triangle of good guys, bad guys (Kyle MacLachlan phones it in) and law enforcement all acting like IQs are dropping everywhere. They operate in a complete vacuum of reality so one moves and the others react and three chase sequences later we're at the end of the episode. And there's zero realism to any of the decisions made by the three groups pushing the wafer-thin plot forward so very, very slowly. There hasn't been this much stupidity in a TV show since The Following got renewed but admittedly even that managed to attempt to engage the audience.The acting is wooden, the dialog is stilted, the fight scenes are horribly shot, there no tension, there's no suspension of disbelief and there's no plot. How can it get any worse? Cuaron just won an Oscar but I suspect he's now lending his name like &#34;Steven Spielberg Presents&#34; - take away his and JJ Abrams' writing credits and here you have a show that would otherwise simply never be aired. It's a total train wreck of irredeemably poor writing and production that's reminiscent of the worst days of the Glen A Larson's factory weeklies. Absolute drivel in every respect and I'm embarrassed to say I watched two of these."
"Ohmy. I used to think that the brand J.J. Abrams meant something good. Now I guess it means that he is being well paid to put his name behind even beyond bad products. Like this. There is not a single redeeming quality that excuses this disaster. The general plot is so bad, repetitive, and predictable as are the plots of each episode. Having a cute lovely child as main character doesn't do anything to mitigate the fact that the plot, the dialogues, and the acting are just terrible. Renegade group of scientists / good rebels help little paranormally gifted girl to escape from being used by mean scientist and government as a weapon. She is paired with a man wrongfully accused of murder, who is rescued from his own execution (an absolutely unnecessary ""plot twist"" -- faux pas really). This guy is her dad, which you know in about 5 seconds, but he is very very very slow and the only person in the universe for whom it takes a couple of terribly bad episodes to discover the obvious. And even though she controls minds and objects and reads situations and people and changes reality, they are utterly unable of doing anything decently well. Except, of course, being very, but very, really good samaritans (in case the blonde hair illuminated by an unsourced light was too sutil, you might need clues to understand that she is angelical). So, they escape all the time. The little angel and the wrongly persecuted criminal. None of whom should be in the acting career. Let's hope they catch them soon and put an end to our misery."
"Good guys, bad guys and a little girl who could be used for either.  The good guys do an unbelievably bad job of being good.  The bad guys do an unbelievably bad job of being bad and the little girl is totally confused.  She knows she has some special capabilities but doesn't seem to know why.  OK, she's a little girl, so let that one go for a while.However, both the good guys and the bad guys know that the little girls capabilities could be used as a &#34;weapon&#34;.  Presumably a weapon of mass destruction or something to do with world domination.  Yeah, right, now that's totally believable.From the little bits and pieces thrown in all over the place the following seems to be the story line:  Some rich guy got mixed up in genetic mutation and found he could manipulate people with &#34;special&#34; capabilities.  Some of the people who worked for the rich guy didn't like the direction he was going so they split and became the &#34;good guys&#34;, leaving the rich guy and whoever he had left to be the &#34;bad guys&#34;.  But the plot thickens.  The good guys kidnap (that's a crime) a little girl because they can see that the bad guys are going to use her for no good.  Then they break a convicted criminal out of jail to be the girls &#34;protector&#34;.  And if we believe the sub plot, this crim really is a bad guy.  Even the little girl picks up on it.  The guy looks at her and tears develop.  The girl tells him he's crying because he used to be good once.  That implies that he really is bad now.  But I'm innocent he says. And the &#34;wise&#34; little girl says, that's what everyone in jail claims.  So why have the good guys picked this one particular &#34;bad&#34; guy to be her protector.  Because....wait for it....because he's her father. Wow!!Ok, so it is a very confusing tale (so far at least) but none of that is helped by the twists and turns that simply go unanswered and are all left to our imagination.  Take the female assassin.  Not a very good one as she fails in every attempt.  So she just up and disappears from the scene to be replaced by a male assassin who obviously isn't any better.  Take the scenario at the casino.  The &#34;protector&#34; convinces the girl to use her capabilities to help him win some money (to replace the bag full he left on a fire escape).  So rightly or wrongly, she helps him rip off a craps table to the tune of 30K.  When he notices that the girl is no longer sitting in the eatery, he panics, cashes in his chips and leaves to find the kid.  Now during his sojourn at the craps table, there was a craps table boss.  He had never seen this guy before and so when he ups and leaves, this &#34;table boss&#34; knows nothing about him other than he was a big winner who suddenly cashed in his chips and left.So we break to the &#34;table boss&#34; who sneaks out into the stair well for a quick smoke.  The male assassin follows him out and starts to beat the crap (no pun intended) out of the craps table boss, expecting him to know everything about the big winner, like who he is, where he went and on and on the saga goes, becoming more unbelievable with every word that is spoken and every disjointed scene that is played out.There is one theme in the show (I suspect a story line stolen from another show) where the little girl does something &#34;good&#34; for someone.  In the first episode it was a young doctor who wanted to toss in the towel.  In the second episode it was a young boy who needed really expensive life saving treatment.  If my suspicions are correct, this story line will continue throughout the rest of the series and some where amongst all the confusion that is the show, the girl will find someone to do something good for in each ensuing episode.I find it hard to believe that people like JJ Abrahams and organizations like Bad Robot got involved in something as poorly produced as this.  I just hope they got their money up front, because I don't &#34;believe&#34; it will last.  What a title for a show.  &#34;Believe&#34;.  Unfortunately it is so &#34;unbelievable&#34; that it makes a mockery of the title."
"The previews led me to watch this because I like the premise and I love Delroy Lindo. But even Delroy is not worth watching in this... I couldn't even understand what he was saying most of the time.The pilot was just done wrong. It seems like someone had a great idea but didn't know how to write the story... thinking the great idea would just MAKE the show good. Sloppy. Lazy.The young actress is good. She has a nice screen presence. The co-star playing her father is a bad actor. I've seen him in other things and he's always &#34;acting like an actor.&#34; He is not enjoyable to watch. His only emotion is some over-the-top bad-guy-that-takes-no-responsibility-for-his-life.I don't understand why they even put this show out there. I can't see it getting better with the lead actor they've cast.I Believe, in the pretty little actress. That's all the show has going for it. Regroup. Re-cast. Hire some writers.I tried to give it two stars... I couldn't do it because it is something I don't want to watch again."
"Don't get me wrong - the film didn't offend me.  I'm not easily offended (I'm a fan of &#34;Antichrist&#34; for example).  And the idea of this film sounds great on paper.But it's so pretentious and silly; this is the emperor's new clothes.  It's two things swirled together.  One is unrealistic sexual behavior, that came from a male mind like an intricate pornographic fantasy.  It reminded me of de Sade's scribblings, not in a level of sadism but in the fact that it's masturbatory and personal. Nothing much to do with real sex or real people.This is crossed with silly pretentious conversation.  Which is sophomoric.  The dialogue is so ridiculous that it makes me blush, not the sex scenes.Von Trier's films usually sound like solid artistic concepts, but play out badly as slow ponderous things.  This is by far the worst one yet though.  It's entirely pointless."
One of the worst efforts at a new series I have ever seen. Don't spend a cent on this crap.
The overall premise of the story is good. The fact that the only people sent down are teenagers? Please. The whole thing is dreadful.
"3 episodes was all I could take.  The premise is ridiculous (especially sending down the little girl - what could a 10 year old girl really do to help the cause?), the pace is slow with little payoff, the characters lack charisma and the BEYOND EXCESSIVE use of lens flare on every scene on the space station screamed cheeseball sci-fi.  Also, what's with not having a proper ambient soundtrack?  The use of pop tunes is comical.  It's like it's amateur hour sci-fi done with the lowest budget possible.If you want to watch a sci-fi human survival drama done right, go watch Battlestar Galactica (the 2004 version) or Firefly and skip this mess of a show."
too much lord of the flies doesn't sound interesting at all!  definitely not my type of show at all too depressing.
"I'm surprised at how many positive reviews this show is getting, its pure drivel.  Logic holes so big you can drive semi trucks through, horrid dialogue, pure teen formula show complete with theme music for scenes to give &#34;mood/meaning&#34;.  How something like this saw enough production to make it live is beyond me and shows just how little studios think of teenagers and the public in general.  Either that or our culture really is that bankrupt and intellectually exhausted to where shallow teenage antics are considered worthy story material no matter how stupid the presentation.  I could go on, but you really are wasting precious minutes of your life watching this."
"Poor acting and scripting, I didn't like this series at all- very corny!  Story was a good idea-Poor translation.  The actors were awful!"
"You know what the bible says, right? The only way divination is possible is through the demons. You should not watch this show, nor should you believe in or follow what she says. The dead &#34;know nothing at all.&#34; They are without thoughts and feelings, for they are DEAD. Anything else anyone tells you is counter to what the Bible teaches and is propaganda originated by the devil. Look it up. It's true."
You need to use the type of CGG that &#34;Archer&#34; uses rather than this stiff cartoonish animation. I could not watch past the first 5 minutes.The story is just too ho-hum. I would never even stream the thing let alone go to a theatre to view. Sorry. Try again.
"Possible spoilers.High concept and no-brain techno-thriller about a young woman using a video chat room as part of a grant-funded project who becomes the target of a high-tech psychopath.  Unfortunately every ounce of thought that was put into this movie went into the visual design (Let's shoot a movie where all the footage is on web cams and computer screens--cool!) and none apparently went into the threadbare and consistently illogical script.The problems start almost immediately when our heroine pitches her project to the university board.  Her pitch is basically I'm going to use a video chat for three months and find out about people and stuff.  Despite the lack of any apparent scientific purpose to her project it's approved--and then things rapidly get more idiotic.The Den is one of those video chat sites where you can switch from person to person randomly, pressing next if you don't like what you see.  The filmmakers didn't give any thought to what you might actually see on such a chat site--what they come up with is and old, overweight woman with too much make-up filming herself laughing like she's a character in a David Lynch movie; a group of people who prank unwitting viewers by playing a fake game of Russian roulette; some guy with a cute dancing penis puppet; etc.  While this is all stuff that would not be out of place on You Tube as filmed video if this were being performed live in a rapid screen chat environment then basically you would have people performing the same bit of performance art over and over and over every 30 seconds or so, which is about as believable as anything else in this train-wreck.The heroine is supposedly tech savvy, yet it's obvious very early in the movie that her laptop has been hacked and she does absolutely nothing about it.  It's not like she has no options--she could ask her techi  pal who set up the video recording software on her computer to take a look or she could just ditch the infected laptop and use some of her grant money for a new computer.  Even after she tells her project adviser from the university that her computer has been hacked she still continues to use it and does nothing to protect herself.Later her boyfriend disappears and she's sure it's related to whomever is stalking her via the internet.  This is such a basic idea that you would think there's no way the filmmakers could screw it up but they do.  You see not only did the boyfriend disappear but every scrap of furniture in his apartment disappeared as well, leaving nothing behind but a laptop which is on the floor transmitting to the villain (or villains).  When someone who has a job and a girlfriend disappears for a day or two without warning they don't take their furniture with them--it would have been much less suspicious (not to mention a lot less work) if the villain (or villains) had grabbed the b.f. without also cleaning out his apartment.  Luckily for the villain (but unfortunate for the heroine as well as common sense) the police don't find the situation suspicious at all and tell her to stop wasting their time.The Den actually continues to get worse after that until it finally runs out of even bad ideas and pretty much just turns into an amazingly dumb and gore free knock-off of Hostel if it were directed by Uwe Boll in first-person video game mode.Not recommended unless you are determined to see every single horror movie that comes out this year."
"THIS MOVIS IS SO LAME!...IT HAS NO SCRIPT OR PLOT JUST A VAUGE CONCEPT,. IT WAS CHEAP AND REALLY? PHONE CAM MOVIES?..REALLY?...LIKE IF 911 DOSENT,...... WORK USE BOTH HANDS AND RUN .....LAME! VERY LAME!ONLY RENT THIS IF,.. YOU HAVE SEEN EVERY MOVIE, EVER TO HAVE BEEN MADE,.... AND DEFINATELY DO NOT BUY!"
"Here's the thing when you adapt a videogame to a movie: make sure the videogame has a plot, interesting characters, and a lot of fun ideas.  Don't pick a racing game.  A racing game is cars driving.  End of story.  Even Space Invaders or Q-Bert or Duck Hunt have better source material for a movie.This is a waste of time.  Bad acting.  Bad writing.  Nothing to care about.  And I really do wish Aaron Paul well, after loving Breaking Bad so deeply.  But this is a flop of flops.Wanna know what happens?  I'll tell you: vroom, vroom, beep beep, screech, and people talking.  That's what this movie is.With some cool cars thrown into the mix.If you wanna see action with hot cars and driving stunts, even Expendables 2 is better than this.  But all the Fast and Furious movies will do.  All the James Bond movies will do--especially the new ones.Or go &#34;old school.&#34;  The Cannonball Run movies.  Smokey and the Bandit movies.  Dukes of Hazzard reruns.  Knight Rider reruns.  Trust me.  All better than this movie.Only rent it for a dollar at a big metal box usually painted red.  Or just avoid at all costs.  Because, you'll want your dollar back."
"Nymphomaniac:  Volume 2 was not where as good as Volume 1.  It was cringe-worthy, not entertaining.  See Nymphomaniac: Volume 1, skip Nymphomaniac: Volume 2."
"When all they do is make shows about politics it gets really boring really fast! They need to focus on relationships more. The political agendas get pushed so hard it's tedious to watch! Also the guardian angel was a total joke! They should have brought back Fred!  He was the best! Her new angel was annoying and was always trying to get attention by not having clothes on, ok we get it already you think your hot get over yourself!!! SERIOUSLY DISAPPOINTING!!!"
"If you are totally ignorant of our history, then, perhaps, you will get an average start on learning some names, a bit of geography, and several significant dates. Other than that, it is no more than a story on par with &#34;George Washington did not lie about chopping down a cherry tree&#34;. Very childish."
Almost unwatchable...there were 11 reloads in final 30 minutes ranging from 43 seconds  to over a minute ( Yes- we started timing them). Too many copies were probably sold. It would have been better with commercials.
"DON DRAPER IS NOW A BORING CAD, PEGGY IS RIDICULOUS, DON'S WIFE IS A CARTOON, BETTY IS A DRAG AND ALL THE CHARACTERS ARE DUMMIES. IT WAS NEVER A GREAT SHOW BUT NOW IT IS AS USELESS AS SCANDAL."
"This show is very tired, must finish watching but it is painful, Don Draper is pathetic and this thing is just dragging, his wife makes me cringe. His ex Bettie is a miserable mess, Roger and his antics are bizarre and yes boring, God let it be over"
"Not sure why they opted for this &#34;final&#34; season. Writers must be burnt out. The 60's fashion is fun to see, but not much else going on there as far as any interesting story line."
Not very interesting
"I've always liked this show, as it's a no-frills forensics show which was around long before CSI (a phony plastic rendition). It was some time before I noticed certain things about the show. The show has one focus...murder of human beings. First, it is well-known that only ten percent of murders are solved, so this show give a false sense that perpetrators will ALWAYS be caught (and that's the way cop shops want the public to think i.e. they are doing their jobs!). But what finally bothered me was that ALL the murderers portrayed were white males! Statistically, all four races murder equally, other than blacks, who are more prolific depending on what town and state you're in! (Look it up!) In addition, females murder at HIGHER percentage than males (~52%), so murderers are NOT gender-specific! So what does this mean? If you show ONLY white males murdering and they are murdering mostly women (already shown to be biased), then the assumption is that ONLY white males murder and this sets up a 'fear-base' among populations and biases 'white males'. This is called misinformation i.e. some parts are true and some not and is a form of propaganda. This show is produced by the J*wish New World Order, which has often proved a vendetta against this particular racial group (white males). I got so tired of this biased viewpoint that I finally stopped watching altogether. You've got to keep an eye on our corrupt media, as they constantly feed you lies and disinformation!"
"The makers of this should be ashamed.  For a story line that could have been really funny, it turned out to be boring."
I was unable to look mat it as it kept popping out.  It is not possible to rate this video.
&#34; Morris also creates commercials to support liberal candidates and causes. &#34; About.com biography.  Just another Michael Moore that is trying to paint a picture of Republicans as evil boogey men.  I turned off after about half since it is obviously not an impartial evaluation of Donald Rumsfeld. I am not a Bush fan but all the five stars above must be Obama voters getting just what they expected from this guy.
I'm a huge Errol Morris fan.  Making good documentaries takes serious courage but when the subject of your film is an infamous  question dodger you better be prepared to ask tough questions and push him for real answers.  This film leads you don't a rabbit hole to nowhere.  I'm pissed that Morris allows Rumsfeld to smile mockingly at the camera for an hour and say absolutely nothing of consequence.  I rented a curtain reveal but instead of a brand new car I wound up with the 1970's vacuum.  Thanks a lot Jim.
"The premise is that an autistic boy films everything as part of his condition.  I feel like this is downright offensive, and that's only where the movie begins.It does some things which are good, like show you the hint of a creature in reflection or a shadow moving on the corner of the frame, but then it just sticks the creature there in front of you, relying on camera shake and vertigo to obscure it.Things like this make me want to go into movie making, because if these idiots can get a movie to market, anyone can."
"It seems like the more companies Disney takes over the worse they become. They now own Pixar, Lucas films, The Muppets and Marvel. And they have ruined all of these franchises. The last few muppets movies were horrible. The las few marvel movies were horrible. And the last few Pixar movie have been terrible as well. This movie is no exception It has average repetitive action scenes and predictable plot. would not recommend."
"Just a dumb movie. I have no idea what made me want to rent this, I just wasted $4. Not Amazon's fault, just mine for hitting the confirm button."
"Well, I wish I could recite the plot or give the prospective audience a review of exactly what this film is about and what I disliked and liked about it but I can't make myself write an intelligent commentary basically for the simple reason that there isn't any thoughtful remarks to be made when it comes to rating this movie.I'll try to summarise what I understood so far, a bunch of superficial men and women are introduced and they talk about their boring uninteresting lives as well as sexcapades. I just yawned the entire time, this is exactly what the media is trying to brain wash people into being nowadays; mindless, self entitled, unambitious dumb heads who will chase the first trend they see.Ugh, I couldn't even finish it skip this mediocre stupid movie and watch something else more meaningful. Whoever made this mess should be ashamed of themselves."
"This is a young adult sex romp comedy, or at least tries to be funny.  Cameron (Virginia Williams) and her husband (Jesse Bradford) have an open marriage. They attempt to convince Owen (Bryan Callen) and Kate (Tammin Sursok) they should try it. Through a series of circumstances they all end up at a Hampton house complete with a young naked man, two girls from Craig's List, a Brazilian bombshell, and a decorator.While this is going on they try to hide it from a visiting author the guys want to sign. Confusion mounts as signs of infidelity are all around.The film wasn't funny. It  took a standard formula and ruined it with a bad plot and idiotic dialogue. They just put one stupid thing on top of another without thinking if it was funny or not. It started out with promise and then fizzled fast.Not recommended even as a rental.Parental Guide:  F-bomb, sex, nudity."
This stinkeroo is so blatantly bad it will make your teeth hurt.It is incredibly disrespectful to women. It makes no attempt to be historically accurate. WGN should be ashamed to be associated with this project!
"The hyped-up description of this mess is empty and unfulfilled.  What is delivered is unexplained weirdness which you patiently sit through because you cannot believe there will be NOTHING delivered in the end.  If Ms. Johansson makes a couple more films like this, no one will again trust a film is good just because she is in it."
"This is the strangest movie I watched in some time.  Scarlett Johansen has very little dialogue, she seems to stumble through and does not demonstrate her acting chops.  I would not recommend this movie at all."
"I don't know of any heterosexual man who is not a Scarlett Johansson fan, but I could be wrong.  This may be rare, but I buy/watch movies based on the actors/actresses rather than the plot.  Obviously, it's hit or miss since not all can be blockbusters.  This one was definitely a miss.  As some posters have already mentioned, there is very little dialogue, a whole lot of SJ looking blankly into space, heavy Scottish accents, and unfortunately a lot of nude men scenes.  The only consolation was that SJ displayed herself in all her glory in a few scenes.  I understand that the female alien role, that SJ played, had a self awareness awakening towards the end, but the journey getting there was excruciating and the ending landed with a dull thud.I must add that the Scottish landscapes and other scenes of life in the UK were spot on.  I lived in the UK for 5 years and it brought back many memories of the mostly dismal weather and the Mom and Pop grocery stores complete with bland food - God Bless America!Unfortunately, I'm not an indie movie fan and cannot recommend this movie even for rental.  If I could rate this movie with half a star, I would.  Save your money."
"I waited eagerly for this film to come out.  The book was fabulous on so many levels. It asked thought provoking questions about the relationship between men and women, women and women, and humans and animals and it even included questions for discussion at the end. Everything that was intriguing or thought provoking in the book is missing. What replaces it is are shots of Scarlett Johansson staring into space, with and without clothes. Seriously, that is a major part of the film. This film goes beyond slow to tedious. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that the story I'd read would suddenly burst forth...it never happened. You might as well turn off the volume and treat it as an abstract art film.Perhaps the biggest initial turn-off was the choice of Johansson. In the book, Isserley was not a beautiful woman, having been (painfully) engineered to feature the large breasts that would cause men to leer at a plain girl with the thick glasses she required to see on earth. That fact made the culling of the hunky men she chose much more palatable. They were to a large extent the victim of their intentions to use someone. The objectification of women was a large part of the story. Isserley was also constantly reflecting on her environment. Her alien insights were intriguing, something not captured by the dull stares they were replaced with in the film.In the end, what takes the place of depth and story line is a very slow and repetitive movie interspersed with a bit of fancy CGI. A group of alien men on motorcycles occasionally zip around to clean up any details left behind by her abductions but that is as action oriented as it gets. Forget this one...I already have."
"Do not waste your money on this Movie, it's below 1 star. Just because Scarlett Johansson is a hot chick, don't be a fool Like me. It should be called Under One Star. If you get sucked in and watch I warned you, Save Your Money for Blockbusters, This movie is Crap.Sincerely Edgar"
"Horrible, terribad, worthless. Do not waste your time. This is a disjointed, awful, attempt at some type of &#34;artsy&#34; statement. Watch at your own risk and waste of money."
"( Don't think so but could be a spoiler) I read the reviews and couldn't believe the movie was that bad I didn't rent  I paid for for the blu-ray, I would say bad mistake but yet I'm glad I did, the reason Scarlett Johansson in front of a full body mirror only in her birthday suit. The movie itself was crap, the story went nowhere fast, nothing explained at the beginning why they were here. If they were going to take over the human race, they sucked at it. They had no superpower no tect, her only job was to pickup men, as good looking as she is, had a hard time doing that. If you are a Johansson fan Buy don't rent. If not you can't say the one stars didn't try to tell you."
"Is it even possible to adequately articulate why a movie that (briefly) features ScarJo nude in all her magnificent glory rates only one star?I read the novel by Michael Faber, and it is the only horror story that I've ever read that literally made my skin crawl. The movie aspires to be as literate and artistic as the novel but only manages a silly pretentiousness. The film starts out with 5 minutes of utter darkness followed by a bright light shown directly in the viewers eye that slowly resolves itself into a headlight; yep, somebody just graduated from film school. Get used to that blackness by the way; 80% of the movie is filmed in a shadowy darkness so that the actors are barely visible. It is the worst cinematography I have ever seen in a film that features an A-List Hollywood star (look at the shadowy image of Johansson's face on the box cover: that's exactly what the movie looks like). I know ScarJo relocated to France to be with her new husband, a bonanza for European film makers, but if she keeps making these cheaply produced European films, she won't be an A-List actor for much longer.The plot is pretty straightforward and can be reduced to a single sentence: an alien is surgically reconstructed to appear to be an alluring human female who entices men to the aliens' feeding pens. But you will NEVER figure this out by watching the movie. There is almost no dialogue (a crime when one considers the literacy of the source material), and then it is spoken in an impenetrable Scottish brogue so thick you will need to read captions if you want to know what they are saying.If you are a fan of Michael Fabers' novels, do not watch this movie; his writing is like a swift flowing stream that captures you and carries you along, but this movie is the dam on that stream."
"Much of the current cast is unlikable: the two new ones are 1) crazy, and 2) bland; and I would like to see the pretentious and over-bearing Heather booted as well; her arrogance and sense of entitlement has become incredibly annoying. I think Heather has exerted too much influence over this show because she is Jewish and so are the show's producers, and that is one tribe that sticks together. Heather pretends to a kind amiable character that she does not possess; she has now twice kicked another cast member out of her house when her or her husband's comments rebounded back on them (and who can forget the infamous ""intervention"" Heather staged when she viscously blindsided Alexis while on vacation). I miss Alexis too; maybe she wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, but she had a good heart (more than can be said of Heather), and Alexis is the greatest beauty that has appeared on any of these house wife shows. I think her beauty is why Heather was so jealous of her; that, and the fact that she is pointedly Christian and Heather is Jewish. I strongly suspect that Heather had Alexis blacklisted. Apart from being eye candy, it was fascinating to watch as Alexis fought for parity in her marriage. They should bring Alexis back. I don't think I can stand another season of Shannon; she is bat s*** crazy (0f course, I'm sure Heather will have her fired anyway). The other new one is just a bland version of Alexis, who knuckles down to Heather (as much of the cast is now doing...where are Tamara's smart aleck wisecracks?  She keeps her mouth shut because she's scared of Heather and of the power she wields over the show). I don't think I'm going to continue to watch with the current cast. Besides, they are so scared of Heather that they cannot be themselves."

"This movie is a failure on so many levels.  Let's tackle the mundane first: It is boring, slow, and barely has a plot.  It milks the kid's sickness like a farmer on meth--to the point of mind-numbing nausea.  Melodrama anyone?The acting is terrible.  You may ask, &#34;Really? Even Kinnear?&#34;  Yes.  You know why?  Because these actors know that they are participating in a fraud, a money-making venture that is exploiting an attention-starved child to support his overzealous Christian parents.Jesus rides a rainbow horse.  Everybody has wings in Heaven.  The Holy Spirit basically looks like BooBerry.  Come on, now.If you think the movie is full of nonsense, read the book.  It will blow your mind that anyone gets away with this.  Really.  Colton's dad is going to fight in the end time.  It's going to be just as Revelation claims!  Literally.  Monsters and all.This movie is really about the father and, to a lesser extent, the mother.  Two poor Christians looking to make a spectacle of their child in order to bring in the cash flow.  The movie is less obvious than the book, but their true selves shine through.  This is not about a child's trip to Heaven.  It is about a father's manufacturing of an experience to excite complacent or bored Christians into coming to church and tithing like ATM's with food poisoning.No?  Look up how long it took for this &#34;experience&#34; to be revealed/reported to the world.  About as long as it takes to write a novel or two.Disgusting and heart-wrenching.  This child only wants to be loved and recognized and accepted as he is.  Yet he needs to jump through hoops and participate in an unconscionable fiction to gain his parents' attention.  This movie is an excellent eye-opener for the religious.  Stay home with your children more days than you go to church.  Maybe those prayer meetings can be skipped to show love to your child.AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  Certainly do not PAY for this tripe."
"It is quite disturbing , for multiple reasons . The story is from a kid who just happens to be a preachers kid ( oh , just what are the odds of that ) and it's clear the dad had means , motive and opportunity to convince the kid that he had been to other worlds . I don't know about the right wing but centuries of science hasn't shown any evidence of an afterlife and believing this kids dad brainwashing him is just as realistic as an afterlife . The fact that Hollywood is giving this guy what he wanted is repulsive . The religious right is repulsive for being so desperate to brainwash a kid . Hence this is where their arrogance shows . It's okay for them to take , shall we say , an extreme stance because of course , there're right and you're wrong . How does anyone make such a call . The mission of the hardcore church is the product of powerful egos . It's the greed of the industry which thrives hypocrisy . Which industry . That question is to be answered , albeit easily , by yourself ."
"&#34;Proxy&#34; makes the mistake of making very specific connections amongst its characters and in its storyline yet sprinkles the world its created within its frames of celluloid with plot holes like some sort of crater-loving Johnny Appleseed. The common thread in the film only seems to be insane behavior with little to no explanation.After Esther loses her baby, you're introduced to her lesbian lover Anika (Kristina Klebe) who is basically a complete knockoff of Lisbeth Salander from &#34;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.&#34; Anika is covered in tattoos and a complete freak in the bedroom. This is something the film points out on more than one occasion. Anika is incredibly vindictive through and through. She enjoys Esther's company because of her craziness.Meanwhile Melanie's husband Patrick (Joe Swanberg) is not a good father. He's more infatuated with trying to come off as the &#34;cool dad&#34; than anything else. The Patrick character goes through some really funky stuff in the film. Something tragic happens to him and Melanie that affects them both. Melanie begins edging back into society while Patrick kind of retreats internally and resorts to brooding. The character begins having delusions that mostly revolve around torture. The way they haphazardly leave a shotgun lying around makes you wonder why tragedy didn't strike them sooner.If you dig a little and stretch what little substance is there, &#34;Proxy&#34; attempts to say something about people dealing with the grief of losing someone close to them, how the loss affects them, and overcoming what seems like crippling depression. But the film seems to illustrate that everyone under those conditions gives in to wrath and revenge especially when it comes to the Patrick and Anika characters.But none of the characters feel genuine. None of their actions seem like logical, real-life conclusions. The film is very slow-moving and bogged down from uneventful and long strings of dialogue. While &#34;Proxy&#34; is listed as a horror, it's not scary. The scariest part is getting through the entire thing. The film's highlight is a slow-motion shotgun blast sequence in a bathroom, but even that is laughably bad thanks to how thick and jelly-like the blood appears. &#34;Proxy&#34; only seems to illustrate that stupid, insane behavior is spread by proxy and everyone suffers, including the film's audience, because of it."
"Proxy feels kind of like a bad Ingmar Bergman drama crossed with an even worse Brian De Palma thriller.  The story starts off being about a pregnant young woman who is viciously attacked outside her obgyn's office but after a couple of twists turns out to be about something else entirely.  Proxy is way too slow and talky to work as a thriller with its two hour plus running time but the acting and writing are too campy for the movie to work as a drama, so you're basically left with a painfully slow exercise in watching unbalanced people do unbelievable things.  I would avoid this but some people might find Proxy's odd tone and twisted characters appealing."
"POORLY DUBBED, STORY LINE/PLOT VERY WEAK LEFT A LOT TO BE DESIRE. THE SCENERY WAS GREAT THE COUNTRY SITE WAS TO DIE FOR."
"It's stupid and a lame premise . No humor , no script and Diaz , Mann , Upton , etc is just pointless , directionless and just a brainless chick flick ."
"I saw this show on our FIOS menu and decided to record it.  We watched last night.  My mom and stepfather liked it.  I could not stand it.  There are a few reasons why.1. There was a lot of action going on.  Not much in the way of story.  I felt like I was watching the season finale of a show, not the first episode.2. There were a lot of characters being thrown at me all at once.  I honestly don&#8217;t remember the names of any of the characters.3. Am I supposed to like the main character?  He is a traitor.  He is a dirty cop who will let his group do whatever they want.  He did take care of one guy.  But the way he did it made me hate him even more.  I understand that they are probably trying to show that it is hard for him, being on both sides.  But I do not care.  I hate the character and do not care if he lives or dies.4. Finally, I wonder how long they will be able to go with this type of story?  I mean, how long can they have a character playing both sides before it just gets ridiculous?  Will they have something in which every five or six episodes, he gets close to getting caught?  Again, that will get old fast.I will try this show again.  I am stuck with it now because my mom and step dad like it.  But I think it sucks to put it simply."
"""The Sacrament"" is nothing more than a very LAME account of the Jonestown/Guyana tragedy which actually took place and where people actually died.  I guess Ti West and Eli Roth were counting on the fact that since the true tragedy had some age on it, they could try and pass this garbage as something original.  Trouble is, there was nothing original about this.You have some reporters who decide they are going to do a ""piece"" on this (fictional) city of Eden Parish.  The filmmakers never bother to tell you where this town was located...I guess because their script writers were not that smart to come up with an unoriginal one.  But I digress.  Seems one of the reporters has a sister who has decided to go beyond the pale and has headed wherever it is Eden Parish is located.  Once they arrive, they start their interviews and all seems well.  But then, people start confessing they are being held against their will, the reporters cannot shut their mouths long enough to get out of Dodge, and then all the people of Eden Parish are forced to drink poison--yes, these filmmakers couldn't even come up with something original for this, so they used what Jim Jones doled out in Guyana:  Kool-Aid laced with some type of poison.I am not going to address the so-called ""acting"" in here because it was non-existent.  ""Father"" (a/k/a Jim Jones) should have been killed during his stint as the clerk in ""No Country for Old Men.""  He just sorta' ""is,"" and that's it.  As usual, Ti West and Eli Roth have delivered yet another stinker to add to their collection.  If you're going to shamefully copy an actual event in our history, have the testicular fortitude to at least do it correctly.  To do what you did is to literally show no respect for the dead.Shame on you."
Dubbed. Couldn't finish it.
Didn't care for this at all but clearly a matter of opinion.
If you want to watch something more adventurous watch basic instinct. This is the same premise but without any bite too it very boring and slow. The girl is crazy but they draw it out and the shrink or whatever falls for her charm. Girl makes a fool out of the shrink and sets him up .
"May be spoilers belowMy mom and I went to see this.  We were thinking it was going to be a normal adult comedy.  Well, we were right and we were wrong.  We actually left after about 50 minutes, but what I saw was so stupid.  The movie had an art house feel.  People get neighbors.  They are a frat.  They ask them to keep it down and things go crazy.  That is the movie, at least from what I saw.There are so many things that happen that just didn't need to.  Like the guy being able to get an erection whenever he chooses.  I mean, really?  It just didn't make me laugh at all.Some of the stuff made me feel uncomfortable.  I know this is a movie, and none of this actually happened.  Still, it made me feel uncomfortable.  Like when the two are having sex and the baby is sitting right there looking at them.  I know what they were trying to do, but it didn't work.  The guy starts smoking a joint and there baby is there.  That didn't work either.  The two worst parts I saw were when the baby put the condom in it's mouth and when the doctor told them the baby had aids.  He was kidding, but I didn't find it funny.I have this pre ordered.  I may cancel that and just rent it when it comes out.  As I said, we saw like 50 minutes.  But, it felt like 15 or 20.  The movie just has the same thing happening over and over again.  It was just a childish movie.  If they didn't have the baby, it could have been better.  It is like they used the kid as a prop.  It was a waste of $16.50.After thinking a bit more about it.I was thinking more about this throughout the day.  Here are my thoughts.This movie has three parts.One is, two people who have a kid and are not yet ready to live the life of two adults.  They want to continue living a life of fun and continue to be carefree.Two, a couple still feel young and want to hang out with people younger with them.  They want to live their life with the people they want to believe themselves to be.Three, people have neighbors that are driving them crazy, care nothing about their feelings and live a crazy life.I asked myself.  If any of these parts were taken out, would the movie have been better?The part with them having a kid and not being ready to live like parents. That could be funny.  I think they could have made that a fun movie.  If they took out all the random use of the F-word, all the sex and random drug use.  I think it could have been great.If it would have been about two married people trying to live like they did when they were kids or teens.  That could have been funny.  If they did a movie like that and took the child out, it could have been really funny.  With the kid not in all the scenes, they could have swore, drank, did all the drugs and had all the sex they wanted.  I would have laughed a piece of my ass off.If they did a movie in which a couple tried to get rid of bad neighbors.  That could have been funny as well.  It would all depend on who was trying and whom they were trying to get rid of.  Husband and wife trying to get rid of neighbors would have added a fun element.  The actions and reactions between the two would have made for some good laughs.The problem is that I don't see how these three things can fit into one hour and a half movie.Another thing I realized is that perhaps some of it had to do with the actors.  I am not saying any are bad.  I like all of the actors I saw.  But, seeing Zac Efron as a druggy, partying teen didn't work for me.  I do not believe I have seen him in anything.  But it just didn't feel right.Dave Franco.  He seemed like a good actor.  I do not know what I have seen him in either.  But it just felt like he was wrong for the character.  I cannot explain why.Another reviewer said something.  They said it felt like you were watching clips.  I thought the exact thing as we were leaving the movie.  Nothing seemed to go together.  No story at all, or maybe there was a story, they just did not pull it off.There is a part of me that wants to finish the movie.  I want to see if there is any point to it and what the conclusion is.  That is why I kept my pre order."
All I got was a preview or interview of what the season was about. I didn't get to the third season at all. What's up with that?
"I give up. This show started well, but is deteriorating into, a politically correct soap opera The sets are great and of course there is always John Malkovich, but it isn't enough.  In his episode, Blackbeard is revealed to be dying and he wants one of the women to take over the island; also there is a black slave girl who seems to want to buy the plantation on which she was raised, and from which she escaped Then there is the fact that Blackbeard  repeatedly sees the ghost of a woman he knew. And yet again, there is a wife who loves her gravely ill husband, but is lovers with the Hero Doctor. Yuck."
"I decided to give this show a shot since it was free and I missed it on airing. so, I watched the first episode and there really wasn't anything to make me or my family want to continue with the series. John Malkovich is just as odd as usual and doesn't really make any sense in his role. give it a pass unless you are hard up for something to watch."
"This show is  a joke. The aliens are pathetic. They're all human like bipeds with nothing more than different coloring.No real alien will look anything like humans. Ask any scientist. Even worse, all the so called aliens act exactly like human beings do as well. Horrid attempt at sci-fi. Horrid writing, Horrid acting. Horrid scenery. Just plain Horrid."
"Watched it thinking it would possibly get better, but, alas a dashed hope not realized!  Editing and more work on the dialogue, script, and acting might have helped, I don't know???  But it seemed to have potential.  A limited budget no doubt!  Perhaps more money would have given it an edge???"
Whatever this lame flick is it's not a horror film.  It looks like a classic bait and switch game to get you to see the documentary that is this film.  I guess some directors  will do anything to get you to view their C Movie.  Not I.
"I think Fiction requires at least a little plausibility to work and frankly I couldn't see the group in this movie surviving a power outage, not to mention that even the most innocuous situation seems to provoke a 5-minute discussion (at times I felt like I was watching a Woody Allen film).  Discordant strings and chaotic cameras try to force thrilling atmospheres during the following anticlimaxes: the alpha-nerd discovers a slashed tire, a girl with some blood on her appears at the door (sending one of the quintet into borderline shock), the mysterious visitor subsequently locks them out of their cabin (oh the humanity!).  OMG, you gotta love the 8 minute, not-so-riveting argument on whether to go out into the dark night and find one of the team where they finally convince his wife to wait till morning by saying ""please... help us get Doug back"" (*camera zooms in on bewildered wife, mouth agape while crickets chirp gleefully in the background*).Featuring the most spineless, indecisive and petty, horror-movie-victim groups of all time hunted by a slasher of epically lame proportions (ooooo... his eyes are milky-white... s.s..scarrrry) ""The Killing of Jacob Marr"" comprises 1 hour/51 minutes of pure, cinematic flatulence.  Somebody light a match.  :o)"
"Another predictable cop show.  Violating people's right, assaulting innocent people while they're handcuffed and covering it up.  Well, actually it's pretty predictable in that sense, the only thing I hate is how the cops are portrayed as the &#34;good guys&#34;."
"So, I like new things.  I recorded the first episodes of this.  I had watched about thirty minutes.  I had to stop it.  It was awful.  SO over acted.  They wasted so much time just showing stuff shoot or be blown up.  When the guy that looked like he was an 80s Bond villain screamed at the guy to tell him something, I said ""that's it for me.""  One of the stupidest shows I have seen.  I will not waste anymore of my time onIn short, bad, over the top acting.  Child like action made to make you feel intense, which it did not.  Never felt drawn in or engaged at all.  I just felt nothing.  I will try again on net flix or hulu plus one day."
"Unfortunately this show has little resemblance to the excellent book it is supposedly &#34;based on&#34;. Well, I guess there is a ship. Yeah, that's about it. As usual, they have taken an excellent and intelligent written work and gone for the lowest-common-denominator and dumbed it down tremendously. It's also fallen into the current trap of &#34;everything being about a virus or plague or disease&#34;. Too bad, as the book's premise was much more compelling. Go read the book and skip the show."
"Oh brother, so pridictible and overacted. Just a waste of time, Don't bother."
"Willow Creek is by far and wide, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The universal acclaim it gets from top-notch critics is alarming, if not terrifying. In fact, Willow Creek's high ratings is the only ""scary"" thing about this movie you will find.When a new found-footage flick gets dumped in theaters, the first word that comes to mind is gimmick. This type of film making attempts to create suspense the cheap way, in light of budget constraints. Very few films are better off having been filmed like this. Chronicle is the only recent one that comes to mind.There have been many, and I mean *MANY* advancements in this film style since The Blair Witch Project. Unfortunately, Willow Creek is so shoestring, that it is more or less a step back into 1999. The budget (if there is one), is not conducive to a monster movie. Let alone Bigfoot, the least terrifying monster anyone can make a movie about.The obvious payoff would be an actor running around in a fur suit, making horny gorilla sounds. If done correctly, the blurry footage would reenact the infamous Patterson-Gimlin sighting. Willow Creek does not end this way.***SPOILER ALERT***Instead of a cheap monkey costume, or even a furry ape hand, the Bigfoot of Willow Creek turns out to be more than one. What the movie does show us is a female variation that is basically a fat 40-something with slinky tits hanging down to her waist, wearing nothing but adult diapers and what looks to be some sort of necklace (an alligator foot?), that was purchased at the nearest truck stop. That's it, no joke. The rest of the final scene involves loud growling and screeching coming from an unseen Bigfoot party as the star couple is mauled and dragged to their death. This entire sequence involves the cameraman's video recorder zoomed in on tall grass as it's dragged along with its owner.Does Willow Creek break any new ground, add something new to the genre, or deliver anything in terms of entertainment value? FNO! Garbage like this should not be green lighted. There are porno's with more exciting dialogue than this. GRADE = F."
"A perfect example of form over function. Unexciting, uninspired visuals set to bombastic orchestral music. Dialogue that is Insipid, empty, meaningless, predictable and repetitive, delivered slowly.  A gimmick of ""viewer discretion is advised"" warnings at every break when nothing in the content comes even close to warranting it.And poor Anthony Stewart Head robbed of his personality by being forced to do an American accent which hampers him because it isn't a very good one and doing it seems to take up the brain processing power that would normally be dedicated to his acting.Skip this bomb."
Blood and guts ... females expendable
Total- TOTAL C- Movie!I plead that you listen to all the 1 star reviews.  They are not lying!!!  OM Triple GGG!!! This movies gore is not even C minus worthy.  There is none. Sad that the  movie trailer has you  thinking otherwise.  I sat through almost half the movie before I had to turn it OFF.  The folks who are rating this movie 5 star must be part of the filming and acting crew.  Great premise but the monster is throw up ridiculous looking and my gag reflexes would not stop and not because of the movie.  More due to the symptoms of actually paying to see this BEFORE SCHOOL special. Best bet- save your money for an adult horror flick not some third grader pop tart and marshmallow roasting affair.
It's so misleading.  Don't rent this movie.  Honestly?  It's the script.  The actors are actually decent... but this doesn't play to any of their strengths - they all seem like nice people... nice people who make bad choices.  It's all over the place and the monster looks better when you only see the head - and that's in profile or dead-on.  All in all... not enough redeeming qualities to justify the price.
"I am sure that there shows that are worse, have even more ridiculous clich&eacute;s, worse acting, cheaper display of endlessly insufferable stereotypes. Might it be that even worse writing is possible. I am very grateful that I have not seen it."
"Very boring, not a good story. Starts out slow and get even slower. A complete waste of good money. I found it very hard to find the main character believable in any way."
This movie had so many pieces that did not fit that it is a wonder anyone would actually invested money in its making.  The script is adolescent and the acting is terrible.  The idea that aliens have taken over the minds of a relatively small group of humans who will make a rock song record with a poorly concealed subliminal message that will cause young people to rise up and change the world into some undefined utopia is so silly that I must assume that whoever wrote this must have suffered from some malady that precluded any logical thinking.  If you are over 12 years old skip this one.
"Wow, this movie is bad beyond belief. It's so bad that after struggling to watch it for 20 minutes I decided that if the world ended in a few minutes, there is no way in hell I'd want to die watching this. Bye money, bye film.To start with, I could hardly hear what the actors were saying. In part this was due to their mumbling, and in part due to noise or music played over their voices. Now, I haven't got a clue how you make soundtracks. That's why I don't make them. The moral is: if you're going to charge people money for something, you need to have some clue - some inkling - of how to make that thing.The video quality was awful too, but that may have been Amazon's fault. Sometime's streaming is like that. It did look though like it was recorded on VHS. In this day and age, that's a miracle.I managed to figure out that one of the main characters had visions of something, possibly some beings from outer space, who instructed him to do stuff and told him about the future. These visions, ugh, how can I explain this. Think the 70s-80's. Think, again, of VHS. Think made for TV. Think infomercials. Think of an ad for Vegas/timeshares/used cars. Think of the cheesiest low budget thing made that would fit into those categories. Now you have some idea of just how godawful these bits were.Twenty minutes in, nauseous, I quit.There is no way that any of the glowing reviews are true. No way. This is not a matter of personal opinion. Not unless the reviewer is the filmmaker's mother AND is high at the time of viewing.I'm posting this review as a public service, to counteract the misleading 4-5 star reviews that came before me and created a high rating which led me to watch this. Save your money and save your time. I wasted money but at least I walked away."
"Season 1 of Under the Dome started off on a relative high note, and at the very least was intriguing enough to keep me watching as things fell apart. By the end, viewers were left with a ruin of jumbled concepts and terrible dialogue, as well as characters that the writers couldn't seem to agree on, each script pulling them in different directions. Instead of establishing psychological complexity, it left an impression of indecisive, inconsistent writing; and the details surrounding the revised and expanded plot-line became straight-up hilarious, taking one of King's stupider books and somehow managing to dumb it down further.I was interested to see if the producers might have been able to salvage something from the smoking rubble they had left themselves with, taking the downtime between filming periods to rebuild the story for season 2. But episode 1 made it pretty clear that Under the Dome is unfixable. Stephen King scripted the season premiere, which no doubt piqued the interest of even those viewers who had abandoned all hope during season 1, but my god... keep that man away from all film sets. While some of his books have been adapted into great films -- The Shining, Stand By Me, and The Mist come to mind -- whenever he gets involved in the transition process, things go horribly wrong. An unintentionally hilarious 'crisis' strikes Chester's Mill once again, as the now sentient Dome throws a hissy-fit and somehow magnetizes itself. As metallic objects start flying through the air in the cheap, clunky manner of the original Star Trek, Under the Dome became a total write-off. I continued watching but ceased to care."
Last season was so much better.
"While I certainly wouldn't claim that the first season represented the pinnacle of acting and dialog, season 2 has somehow managed to find a way through the bottom of that barrel and plunged to new depths of poor production and ludicrous logic. It's probably no spoiler than season 1 ended with Barbie (yes, that's a guy's real name in this show) with a noose around his neck on the gallows - this is resolved in the first episode in the most uninspired, incredulous, eye-rolling and ultimately lame way in seconds before they drop him to certain death. And that's the best thing that happens.Who might be the screenwriter for this first episode? Was it a second-grader finishing a corrective English assignment or the overrated ""master of horror"" himself Stephen King? Seriously, I'm surprised he didn't introduce an author with writer's block as a lead character. This episode brings in all the worst and most repetitive tropes of King's recycled writing from the cringe-inducing dialog to total disregard for character, logic and story. It's like laziest episode of The Outer Limits had an affair with a canceled daytime soap opera. It's so bad as to be completely unwatchable.Though it limped through a first season as its own concept, this show has now officially become Lost. By which I mean the TV show, although it has actually become lost as well. Things that happen for no reason are blamed on the island, I mean dome, which exists purely to act as a sandbox around a bunch of overwrought D-list actors (if only I bottle up their energetic overacting and sell it). Plot-wise, they can throw anything into the mix from resurrection the dead (done that) to changing physics (done that, too) and getting all pseudo-intellectual (please don't do that). It's horrible. And to think Dean Norris was so good in Breaking Bad. So when's the next season of The Americans coming on?"
"Season one was decent. But this second season is pathetically bad. Not only is it all around bad TV, but it has become a vehicle for blatant in your face product placement. THIS PROGRAM IS NOTHING MORE THAN A 42 MINUTE TV COMMERCIAL!"
"hideously acted. i watched season 1, and it must have not sucked because i queued up season two. or maybe my tolerance for crappy dialogue and unbelievable plot lines is just low today. really awful, couldn't even finish."
"This season is simply ridiculous. Where did all these new characters come from? The science teacher just pops up out of nowhere and seems to be an expert in just about every specialty in science, engineering, skilled labor, farming, history, anthropology,etc. The barber and brother in law of big jim are two other characters that just make no sense. I'm totally turned off and won't be watching to see how this dome thing is resolved."
"Amazon's attempts at original work appeals to the lowest denominator - not common denominator, I mean the lowest IQ level - Dome is even worse than the wasteland TV is. Amazon has more money than Netflix; yet fails to create decent shows. Why is this happening to Amazon? Certainly Jeff B. has talent in all other areas; but, wow! Jeff B. fails totally at creativity. Netflix is making toast out of Amazon's attempts at films."
"When &#34;Under the Dome&#34; premiered in the summer of 2013, I was excited as anyone to see Stephen King's novel come to life.  That excitement seemed to have payed off, as the few first episodes were mind-boggling in terms of visuals and atmosphere.  Simply put, the show looked like a real winner.Sadly, I don't know if I've ever seen a show take such a nose-dive.  For the last half of Season One and so far into this Second Season, the quality of the plots/characters has descended into an absolute mess.  I usually don't like to review an &#34;unfinished product&#34;, so to speak, but I became so frustrated with this show that I had to cut ties.  The other night, I sat down to watch the third episode of this second season.  About 15 minutes in, I thought to myself &#34;why am I watching anymore?&#34;.  It had become a chore, and that's when I know it is time to hang it up.Basically, I think what happened to this show is that it made the decision to stray from King's novel.  Had they just done a 10-15 episode mini-series and stuck to the events King penned, this show might have really worked.  As it is now, though, they are just treading water (and, I would argue, barely staying afloat) and wasting time.  The characters are going nowhere, each episode does very little to resolve (or sometimes even reference) the dome mystery, and let's face it...acting was never a strong suit of &#34;Under The Dome&#34;.It pains me to say, as I had such high hopes and excitement for this show, but it is a mess right now.  Until the show creators make the decision to narrow the focus and actually start focusing on real issues (not just a &#34;story of the week&#34;) approach, it will continue to flounder.  I have a feeling, though, that the viewing public will not stick around longer enough to give them that opportunity."
"Was really looking forward to this as the premise mirrors my own life in so many ways, but oy, the writing is weak, the main character is a piece of wood (we're supposed to think he's deeply disturbed and divided through flashbacks of him as a kid protecting his older brother), but there's no vision of the turmoil inside Barry (Basam) except through his tepid American (blonde, of course) wife, who keeps pestering him and saying there's no joy in their life (well, why hang around so long then?).  So Barry/Basom clearly has issues to work on, and I liked the storyline, but there's no depth, it's all formulaic cartoon that was done much better in Syriana and other films on Arab potentates, the potential for political reform, good son vs. bad son, etc.  Bummer.  Could've been a contender."
"Honestly, I should have paid better attention to the 1-star reviews. I love both Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, which is why I feel terrible for what I'm about what I'm about to say: It was painful to watch. There wasn't anything even remotely laugh-worthy. I watched the entire movie hoping that there would be some redeeming qualities, but sadly - there were none. I honestly hate to say this, but please don't waste your time. I'm doing you a favor!"
"Parody of romantic comedies is a huge disappointment given all of the talent involved.  The idea was to do a meta romantic comedy that comments on all of the clich&eacute;s of the genre while also indulging in them--it feels like two thirds of the movie features the actors talking in air quotes.  Unfortunately with his focus on being clever writer director David Wain forgot to bring any laughs.  Seriously, I've seen god-awful straight-to-video horror movies by The Asylum that were much funnier than this.Not that it matters but if They Came Together really wanted to parody Hollywood romantic comedies then Amy Poehler is miscast--she isn't pretty enough to be a lead in an actual Hollywood romantic comedy and would likely end up playing the sassy best friend.  Paul Rudd, on the other hand, has the leading man good looks but he isn't capable of elevating weak material, which is what he's stuck with here.Some people may be able to get on the same wavelength as They Came Together but I found it to be an unfunny drag that was torture to sit through--I actually stopped the movie several times and pondered whether it was worth trying to make it to the end or not.  It wasn't."
It wasn't my cup of tea. I know most romcoms stink but I gave this one a chance. Bad idea.
"This is second only to &#34;Dinner for Schmucks&#34; as the dumbest movie I've ever seen.  I THINK it's supposed to be a spoof on romcoms, but that's just a guess -- that's how bad it is.  I'm surprised that Amy Poehler would agree to appear in such an awful film.  I like Paul Rudd, but he'll appear in anything. I thought Poehler was more discerning.  Save your money!"
"Publicizing a movie is very expensive but here in the guise of honest viewer reviews, false advertising with faked praise reviews by those who have a connection with the films, it's FREE."
"Let's stipulate that Halle Berry is a beautiful and talented actress.  Based on this show we can safely conclude that beauty and talent are not enough to save a mediocre script.  Alone in a CGI space something or other Ms. Berry becomes mysteriously pregnant, apparently by the ghost of her dead husband (?).  The Space Agency's medical director agrees to conceal this salient detail from the agency.  Had enough yet?  It gets worse.  A parallel plot re-cycles, almost verbatim, the basic elements of ""Artificial Intelligence"", Mr. Spielberg's 2001 mess about creating a child-robot (android).  Not to be confused with the child Ms. Berry's character is purportedly bearing. The whole thing is stirred into a thin soup of bad dialogue and mediocre acting.  BTW:  I agree in general with the Infinite Loop review (see above).  Originality is not on display here."
"a 'LifeTime Movie' in spaaaaace.  Boring....and another thing women who are well educated in this competitive field are NOT that superficial and don't have Hally's fake nose, fake boobs, lipo and fake hair...sorry don't appreciate the stupid female stereotypes."
