"I highly recommend this series. It is a must for anyone who is yearning to watch ""grown up"" television. Complex characters and plots to keep one totally involved. Thank you Amazin Prime."
"This show always is excellent, as far as british crime or mystery showsgoes this is one of the best ever made.  The stories are well done and the acting is top notch with interesting twists in the realistic and brutal storylines.  This show pulls no punches as it enters into the twisted minds of criminals and the profiler psychiatrist who helps out in a northern english city police force. The show looks like it is shot in Manchester but it is called by another name in the show.  One episode is not on this disc the excellent 'prayer of the bone"" which is on a seperate disc.  Still crime shows don't get much better than this one on either side of the ocean.  It's just a great show that never has had a less than well made episode. Unfortunately like all British shows you only get about five shows a year ,  but these are an hour and a half shows , still one could hope for at least 8 of these a year.  The realism and depth of the main character Tony Hill as protrayed by the excellent Robson Green is well worth viewing because he just makes this role truly part of himself in everyway.  I bet he went to crime scenes even in real life to research his role.  But the writers too must be applauded for their way above average stories.  Lets hope this show continues on for many years to come."
"I discovered this series quite by accident. Having watched and appreciated Masterpiece Contemporary: Place of Execution, I was keen to read the novel (which inspired the TV adaptation) by Val McDermid. The novel was very well-written, and a nail-biting suspense thriller. Then I discovered that Val McDermid wrote other novels as well, and a couple of them inspired the TV crime drama Wire in the Blood.I finished watching all of Season 1 and have become a fan of this gritty crime drama that follows the investigations led by DI Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris). She is assisted by clinical psychologist Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green), a rather eccentric figure who delves deeply into the minds of serial killers, studies patterns of criminal behavior and profiles criminals. His methods may seem strange at times, but he always manages to get results. Both Jordan and Hill make a strange if compelling pair, with Jordan analyzing a case based on evidence, and Hill working based on his knowledge of deviant behavior and what makes people commit disturbing crimes.Unlike some of the ""cozy"" mysteries such as the long-running Midsomer Murders - Set One and The Complete Inspector Lynley Mysteries, Wire in the Blood is not for the faint of heart. The crimes are horrific, sometimes involving children, almost always patterned on deviant behavior and the suspects are almost always very disturbed individuals. The crime scenes are difficult to watch as are the way victims are found and even the forensic examinations are graphic and unsettling. Though compelling, this is not really a show to watch in one sitting, and may very well give viewers nightmares.The first season contains three main stories, each divided into two episodes:The Mermaids Singing - Hill is on the trail of a seriously disturbed serial killer who targets homosexuals.Shadows Rising - The skeletal remains of a young woman is found, and when further evidence turns up, DI Jordan and Hill realize they have a serial killer on their hands, one with a penchant for dark-haired young women.Justice Painted Blind - Another unsettling case, this time revolving around an old child abduction and murder case. A couple of apparently random murders turn out not to be so random after all when it is discovered that the victims do share a connection involving an old court case where the accused was found not guilty. This throws up a whole bunch of suspects, including the parents of the murdered girl.The writing on this crime drama is excellent, and Robson Green is credible as the clinical psychologist who has a rare knack for profiling and getting under the skin of some of the most dangerous criminals. The drama also explores the chemistry and tension between Hill and DI Jordan, all of which result in a riveting show that keeps viewers coming back for more.The streaming was good overall with only a little delayed streaming during Episode One. There were no glitches on the other episodes. The picture quality could be improved though as it did seem a bit grainy to me."
This is the best of the best comedy Stand-up. The fact that I was able to just watch continuously one comedian after another was great. I had the best laughter I have had in a long time.
Watched it for Kevin Hart and only Kevin Hart!  He makes me laugh.  The best comedy comes from pain and Kevin does his comedy with a huge heart.
"Enjoyed some of the comedians, it was a joy to laugh after losing my father whom I was a caregiver for"
All the comedians are hilarious. I have seen them all before on Comedy Central but what a great idea to put them all together. I love Amazon prime and I love their shows. They are so much better than Netflix. I got rid of my Netflix Amazon rocks and Netflix well it thymes with rocks but in a bad way.
Very funny. Some of the comedians were funnier than the others. We were laughing so hard the dog thought something was wrong with us
Great variety of good comics. Each show is just the right length to not get boring. The comics are really funny too.
"I loved the humor of the stand-up comics featured here. I only got the free episode listed at the beginning of the season, but it probably gives a good idea of what is contained in the rest of the season. I have actually watched several episodes of this season when I was having a free 30-day trial membership in Amazon prime, which I eventually plan to become a paid subscriber to."
Season 2 of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia is mandatory for anyhow who watches the show to own. This season has some of the greatest episodes in Sunny history!
Each episode gives me more entertainment than anything else on the tube. though I may not  want to have these characters as real friends - the women are hot though - the plots and characters make for great viewing.Do not see myself abandoning this series.I give 5 stars to every episode and season of Always Sunny in Philadelphia!Thanks Amazon!
Got these for my son's birthday. He says they are great! They are funny so give them a try! OK!
Gave this to a good friend and ordered another for myself.  Very funny!  I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys irony and a good laugh.
"Out of all the new comedies that have come out in the last ten years, Sunny is as the top of my list.  You need an affinity for quirky, offbeat humor to enjoy it, not to mention a high tolerance for raw language and sexual humor.  The first season consisted of just seven episodes, but established the core characters and operators of Paddy&#8217;s Pub; owners Dennis, Mac, and Charlie, and waitress/Dennis&#8217;s twin sister Dee.  In Season 2 (ten episodes), Danny Devito comes on board as Frank, Dennis and Dee&#8217;s dad.  The show&#8217;s creators (Rob McElhenney/ Mac; Glenn Howerton/Dennis; and Charlie Day/Charlie) are hilarious as actors, and also as writers.  Every character on the show stands out and gets big laughs out of me.  It&#8217;s one of those great ensemble casts that&#8217;s incredibly balanced in terms of the personalities and comedic nature of each character, resulting in a consistently high level of quality in every episode.  These first two seasons have some of my favorites, including &#8220;Charlie Has Cancer,&#8221; &#8220;Charlie Got Molested,&#8221; &#8220;Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare,&#8221; &#8220;Hundred Dollar Baby,&#8221; and &#8220;Charlie Goes America All Over Everybody&#8217;s Ass.&#8221;  Like most fans of the show, I tend to favor the Charlie-themed episodes, and considering that he&#8217;s the only one so far to get movie roles and a gig hosting SNL, it&#8217;s clear how important he is as part of the cast.  But that&#8217;s not a knock against anyone else.  I can&#8217;t really imagine it continuing if they lost any of the key characters of Dennis, Dee, Mac, and Charlie, and even though Frank wasn't there in the beginning, it would definitley hurt the show to lose him.  As far as current TV comedies go, no one else is doing anything funnier than &#8220;Always Sunny,&#8221; and these first two seasons show it."
"4.5 starsI knew nothing of this until a friend lent it to me this weekend. I laughed. Often. At things that aren't supposed to be funny, but as any serious fan of comedy knows, those can be the best laughs. I walked away feeling lighter and happier. If that ain't comedic success, what is?IASIP is like Seinfeld if the SeinFour were ten years younger, Irish, and ran a bar in South Philly. These guys have clearly studied Sein and Curb very closely, and their tight timing and topics and banter are all very Larry Davidesque...but they go places even LD won't. The best two shows of the 7-episode first season are about cancer and abortion; I howled at some moments. These guys have done what so many guys want to do: make a show about how funny they are. Except, these guys really are funny. Sometimes. But hey, no one's always hittin' homers, even on comedy 'roids, so I cut these three some slack and marvel at how tightly they work together. There's a lot to be said for working with old friends, if they have talent: the camaraderie and timing here are born of many years of drinking and laughing and thinking and falling down, no doubt. And these three guys are each pretty dang funny, each in his own fashion.DeVito is ok but I liked the first season best for its rawness. Still, as the later shows get a little more polished it's often in good ways.If you don't like drinking, if you insist on PC language from your friends and neighbors, and if you are in general just plain uptight about people living and thinking the way you want them to, look elsewhere. But If you enjoy tying one on and laughing your butt off at the endlessly silly idiocy that accompanies being alive in America these days, you may just find Always Sunny to be almost always funny."
"This series revolves around 4 friends who run a bar in Philadelphia and who go through a variety of difficult but extremely funny and often extravagant situations. I had heard of the series previously but was only convinced of buying it after seeing an intervewi with the actress. What a suprise: this is a somewhat lesscorrect version of Friends meets My Name Is Earl. I agree that this may not be correct at all since this series has no respect for conventional moarl issues such as lying about having cancer, discovering a friend's grandfather was a nazi. It also tackles the strange love men sometimes has for guns ets... In some ways it is difficult to describe and understand if you have not seen this gem of comedy."
"Watched Charlie Day give a commencement address and then decided to check out his show. Found this show surprisingly GOOD!  The cast is funny but they deal with real world guy and girl issues I. A fun, but informative way. Highly recommend it and not just for the laughs."
I wish I were a part of this cast. This is the funniest stuff ever. YOU MUST GET THIS IF YOU ARE A DIE HARD &#34;SUNNY&#34; FAN!
"Who says the sitcom is dead?  Not since Arrested Development has a sitcom been this truly hysterical and quick paced that you don't know what to expect next.  It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, originally premiering on the FX network in 2005, revolves around four friends: Charlie (Charlie Day), Mac (Rob McElhenney), Dennis (Glenn Howerton), and his sister Dee (Kaitlin Olson); all of whom own and run an Irish bar in downtown Philadelphia.  They get into all kinds of crazy hijinks through misunderstandings and just plain bad judgement, ranging from being mistaken as a gay bar to Charlie lying about having cancer.  Yes, there's nothing really wholly original about the show's premise, but it remains hysterically funny throughout.  The second season of the show finds Danny DeVito joining the cast as Dennis and Dee's father, who isn't the sanest of the bunch either.  This DVD set compiles the first two seasons of the show, and is definitely worth picking up for viewers who turned it when it first premiered, as well as newer viewers who may be anxiously awaiting the upcoming and long awaited third season of this very funny show."
"I heard about It's Always Sunny from a Kevin Smith Smodcast. If you haven't been force-fed the usual formula comedycrap replete with obnoxious laugh tracks, you might just like it.It's not a continuous knee-slapper but just some good ol' off-center comedy. Welcome back Danny DeVito - sure he's doing the same ol' DePalma character, but I STILL think it's funny. For me, it's another one of those sit down and plow through a DVD at a time. I would never have had the patience to watch these one at a time on the tube when it aired (that's just me)."
"Fan-tastic. This is a show about terrible people being terrible, and it's hilarious and mean and perfect. Watching the characters grow into such vile monsters is a real joy. Seriously!"
I love this show and I don't think that will ever change.  I hate all of the characters and I mean that in the best way.  Hilarious.
"I love it's always sunny and wanted to own the seasons, but didn't want to spend a lot of money. Came to Amazon and managed to buy seasons 1-6 for less then $25!! Way pumped!The discs were clean, no scratches, worked perfectly. No problems at allAs for the first seasons of it's always sunny, you either like it or you don't. I used to hate this show, but it's now one of my favorite shows. If you haven't seen it yet, then get on it player!"
Wish I had watched this show when it began back in 2001.  Very happy that it is available from Amazon to stream.  I've watched 5 seasons in 3 weeks!  Will keep you on the edge of your seat (if you suspend reality a little bit).  Highly recommend!
Non stop action with edge of your seat thrilling plots with a new turn every minute.  Cast of great stars keep all events seeming like weeks but actually are in 24 hours
I had a hard time following this show when it was on TV but now that it is on Prime I can watch the episodes in a row without commercial interruption. I now can watch all of them at my leisure. I am so excited that I can't wait for another day to watch more! And I think Keifer Sutherland makes the show. I would like to tell all viewers out there that you should be on Prime because all of these episodes are for free with your membership. Many of your TV episode series are for free and tons of movies. So you all out there join Amazon Prime!
"Season 5 24 is fantastic.  Each episode gets more and more exciting!  I keep thinking, it can't get any better than this, but guess what!  It does! Fantastic show, no show can beat 24!  I am a wreck when its over, but I love it so!"
"Seson five is killer! I would recommend this dvd set to anybody! Full of suspense killer action! Jack is a bad ass! Buy it , you won't regret it!"
This show is like a runaway train ride. Every episode has poor Jack in some death defying crisis. Really enjoyed the ride.
"For sheer intensity and plot topsy-turvies, no other show comes close to 24. You'd think the premise (every hour of the 24 episode-long season is played in real-time; thus 24 encapsulates a full day) would get old by now, but, surprisingly, the producers and writers have managed to come up with another riveting, must-see season. In fact, this might be the best season of them all. The thrills and nail-biting suspense (as well as the SPOILERS alert) begin early in the season five opener, with the shocking slaying of President Palmer and assassination attempts on familiar CTU agents (one of which is tragically successful). Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is lured out of hiding after 18 months and becomes rapidly embroiled in a devious conspiracy that goes all the way up to the White House. As he becomes the most wanted man in America (he is framed for Palmer's assassination), he must try to ferret out the true culprit(s) and again save the country from deadly Russian extremists and various domestic villains. On a personal level, he must come to terms with the deaths of personal friends, the alienation of his daughter Kim, and the fact that his former girlfriend  Audrey Raines (Kim Raver) might have moved on.There's a reason why Kiefer won the best dramatic actor Emmy and why 24 beat out the likes of the West Wing, the Sopranos, Grey's Anatomy, and House for best drama. The fifth season is fully serviced by a coming together of story and acting - from the gripping, edge-of-your-seat plot line, with its manic twists and turns, to the no-quarters-given, full speed ahead performances of the cast, but specially of Kiefer Sutherland, who gives his all in inhabiting his role. Kiefer IS the show and consistently produces such driven intensity, lying just beneath an icy cold surface, and yet his eyes reveal a vulnerability of sorts, when he's reacting to something personal to him. He makes a scene work, even without dialogue. Very good stuff. And, no, you do not want to get in the way of Jack Bauer.There are other standouts, of course. Gregory Itzin as the shifty and weak-willed U.S. President makes you gleefully hiss, while Jean Smart as the medicated First Lady Martha Logan brings earnest soap-opera acting to primetime. Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe O'Brian) continues her highlight role as CTU's brilliant but cantankerous and socially-inept tech support operative. Meanwhile, James Morrison, Roger Cross, Kim Raver, Carlos Bernard, Louis Lombardi, and Sean Astin become the season's dependable, solid bedrock.That so many of the regular cast die in this season lends an immediacy to the episodes and exponentially raises the stakes. There's no comfort level at all here, as you're never sure who would survive in the end (but, with this show, were you ever sure?). Even Kiefer Sutherland had played around with the idea of having Jack Bauer biting the dust (Please, no!).So, the 24 - Season Five dvd box releases December 5, 2006, just in time for you to go thru 'em to prep for season six, which begins next January on Fox. Season Six, by the way, picks up nearly two years after season five's finale and will have James Cromwell with a recurring role as Jack's estranged dad, Phillip Bauer. Also joining the cast is Eddie Izzard, Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle), Peter MacNicol, Regina King, and the beautiful Rena Sofer. I can't wait to own season five and, then, to see season six. Long live Jack Bauer!"
"Revel in his awesomeness!!! For he is a god amongst men and he is deserving of all praise that can possibly be heaped upon him. The one time the Emmys got something right!! Jack Bauer is as close as any fictional character has become to being superhumanly powerful, and at some times his recurrent circumvention of the bureaucratic system, assaulting his friends and co-workers, his flagrant abuse of ""prisoner's rights"" and his uncanny ability to fight his way out of any trap... it may require a little bit more suspension of disbelief than would normally be necessary in a lesser show, but the very core of this show is Jack Bauer, or more specifially, Kiefer Sutherland and his increasingly better performance each season of 24. When he is having a particularly emotional moment, you feel it exude from the screen.... this is just an example of the power that Sutherland brings to this show. Also standing out as always is Mary Lynn Rasjkub as the wonderfully ascerbic and wicked-tongued Chloe O'Brien. The introduction of her character is one of the best things that's happened to this show. But this season has some other stand-out characters: one that was introduced in season 4 and a brand new one. Fans of the show know these as President Charles Logan (the wonderfully slimy Gregory Itzin) and his first lady Martha Logan (the amazing Jean Smart). Their interplay and their performances are almost as key as Sutherland in this season. Another thing that came to be almost an in-joke is that three members of the cast of the original ROBOCOP film appear in different parts of the series, which as a fan of that film was just really cool to see. Whether or not that was intended, it's still a nice touch for genre fans. Julian Sands has lots of fun chewing up scenery as the evil Russian-yet-English-Accented Terrorist. The premise is per usual: Jack must defy all odds to save the country and avenge his personal losses. But the plot itself is of a higher level of complexity and tragedy this season than prior seasons. The way it begins is ALMOST as shocking as the way the season ends. And the ending of the final episode of the season... that scream you heard in the whole of the United States and parts of Canada and Mexico... that was me. January 2007 CANNOT GET HERE SOON ENOUGH!!!"
"The first five seasons of 24 are the best thriller/escapism you'll find on television. It's fast-paced, big-budgeted, over-the-top (sometimes WAAAAAAAY over-the-top), and mostly clever. But I don't think ANY of the previous seasons (or the lame season 6) can come even close to the excitment and joy of watching this fifth season.Yes this season follows the same (tired) gimick of everything happening in real-time, but what set this season apart for me was it's more focusd plot-line. Several of lead character Jack Bauer's friends are killed or attacked and he's out to find out who and get revenge. Ok, sometimes the overall story arch DOES get side-tracked to the typical (terrorists trying to release poisonous gas), and sometimes it's not always that interesting (CTU gets infiltrated AGAIN!). But none of these side-attractions even BEGIN to take-away from the exciting central story which pushes along at break-neck speed and crediblilty (thanks also to the believable performances of the ENTIRE cast).Like some people I try not to watch the show on TV and much prefer to wait for the DVD to come out which is why I can't recommend buying this season enough (thought why there's not subtitles on every episode is beyond me). Yes it's a couple years old now, but it's still the best (and most affordable) 24 episodes of action you'll find anywhere."
"Just finished the 5th season of this very riveting series. I must admit the season started off with a Bang! When you watch it you will see what I mean. However, about mid season I had to push myself a little to get through to the last 1/3 of season, and I am SO glad I did! WOW! talk about being on the edge of my seat. This season really does have more of an edge to it. A fictional Syntox gas, nerve agent,  is involved, terrorist plots, political corruption and some of the main characters are bumped off! Loved this season and would highly recommend it to anyone!"
Absolutely great show! Every episode keeps you on the edge of your seat!  Makes it very hard to turn it off!
I particularly like the fact that the show (which I missed when broadcast) subtly introduces the moral dilemmas of the situations.
"In the aftermath of season 4, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) had to fake his own death and go into hiding.  But he can't seem to stay in retirement for long.  Someone knows Jack is alive and targets his friends, forcing Jack to come out of hiding to face down terrorists yet again.Meanwhile, it is an important day for the United States and President Logan (Gregory Itzin).  He has been working hard to iron out an anti-terrorism treaty with Russia, and that treaty will be signed that day.  But the treat of terrorists in Los Angeles with stolen nerve gas just might be enough to derail the treaty.Season 5 won an Emmy for best drama, and it was well deserved.  Even after five years, this show is gripping drama with excellent writing and acting.  I am glued to my seat every week, breathing only during commercial breaks.  This season the threat and storytelling seemed more focused then previous years, adding to the drama.There were a couple flaws this season.  I sure don't remember the explanation of who knew Jack was alive at the beginning of the season.  Maybe it was mentioned and I missed it.  Furthermore, we have yet more examples of lack of security at CTU.  While it does make for gripping drama, it does seem like they could come up with a new plot trick every so often.My biggest complaint this season was the body count.  We lost several key characters from previous years.  While I understand the producer's desire to keep us on the edge of our seats, can't anyone from the show live happily ever after?  It honestly got to the point I dreaded seeing anyone who had been on the show before for fear they would be killed off.Still, these are minor issues with a truly wonderful show.  I'm counting down the hours until the next season premiers and we can start the rush all over again."
"This is a banner series for this extraordinarily conceived and executed television series.  From its explosive opening through 24 hours of plot twists, exciting action, and devastating loss, this season is absolutely superb.  Be warned though---there's lots of unexpected killings in this season and several favorite characters are disposed of.  You just don't know what to expect from this Emmy-winning series.Kiefer Sutherland won his much deserved Best Actor emmy as Jack finds himself confronted with one impossible task after another.  The supporting cast is superb:  James Morrison as CTU director Bill Buchanan; Mary Lynn Rajskub as the neurotic but brilliant Chloe; Kim Raver as Jack's former love Audrey; William Devane as irasible Secretary of Defense; Louis Lombardi as the plump and human Edgar; Jayne Atkinson as the Homeland Security Director; Sean Astin as the pompous replacement; Peter Weller as the vicious assassin; Glenn Morshower as the stoic Aaron; Jude Ciccollella as Mike Novick; Julian Sands as the evil terrorist; and of course, Gregory Itzin and Jean Smart as the President and First Lady, who were robbed of their supporting actor Emmys, and who are just fantastic in these pivotal roles.24 is one of the best series out there and this season shows why."
"24, Seasons 1 - 8 are some of the best I've ever seen! From the first hour, every scene is filled with suspense and anticipation. JACK BAUER (Kiefer Sutherland) is a story hero that is always two steps ahead of the bad guys which helps keeping me from throwing rocks at my i-pad (the bad guys)! Can't wait for the next season to show up!&#128522;"
"Love the show. Period. Have just finished watching the first 5 seasons (something of a marathon over the last month).Season 5 is probably my favorite season to date. It starts strong and doesn't let up until it's over.As to packaging and the discs themselves: the first 4 seasons come in fold-out packaging + outer sleeve, much like the Highlander series and a few others. The first discs contain the episodes themselves, and the last disc contains some bonus materials. Season 5, however, breaks from this tradition and instead packages the discs in 4 slim cases (the 4th holds the bonus features disc). A change of page in packaging, but still quite attractive, with approximately the same shelf footprint (if not slightly smaller).Season 5 continues to do a good job with chapter breaks, scene selection menus, and bonus features. I might note however, they've added a slightly longer intro before getting to the main menu (looks like booting up and logging into a CTU computer system). However, on my DVD player I could skip ahead without having to play the whole sequence. So, it wasn't completely ungainly.The video and audio were up to par. Of course I don't have a large-screen/wide-screen TV nor surround sound, so I can't test under all conditions. But if there were any video or audio issues I didn't notice them. Perhaps some moire/color issues in scenes with close parallel-line patterns. But I've noticed that on any number of DVD releases of other series from other studios, so I wouldn't say there was any more in 24 than other series.Overall, I highly recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen 24, and who likes the spy/thriller type show. If you liked Alias and/or La Femme Nikita, you'll probably like 24 as well. There are some ""intense"" scenes and probably some harsh language, so preview episodes before showing it to any youngsters, if at all."
"24 is the most  fun series I have ever seen on tv.  I love keifer Sutherland and it appears to me that a lot of actors get good parts and get in a lot of acting.  Also this series has people, even the bad guys speaking articulately and very rationally.  We are seeing a show full of admirable people not a bunch of losers.  That must be a part of the popularity of the series.Note something else, these people comply with the human requirement  of pronouncing judgement."
"There was lots of action, I love it , Cant wait for the next season, very good acting. A lot of actors I remember. I would recomend to everyone."
"Season Five was the winner!  Of course, Kiefer and the regular cast absolutely rock, it was fantastic to see as much of Agent Pierce as we did this season, and Gregory Itzen and Jean Smart...... well, what can I say about them other than === shoulda won the Emmys!!!"
"We were not fans of 24 until a family member gave us Season 7 DVD.  The show is well done, we get a kick out of the fact that 24 shows is equal to 24 hours of activity.  And laugh that no one ever takes a nap or eats during any of the shows.  We are now working on Season 6 and then will catch up with the new show on TV this season."
"The shocking opening moments of the fifth season of 24 literally blew away everything that we've come to know about the show.  Alliances are challenged, close friends are lost--all the while Jack Bauer tries to keep his sanity and find out who the real culprit is behind one of the most trying days in American history.The cast is perfect, the storyline is compelling, and the action is never ceasing.  This season had by far the most suspense as well as the most cliff hangers.  After I finished watching an episode, I usually wanted to go right to the next and watch it right away!  There is, however, a big plot hole in the season.  The fate of Evelyn Martin and her daughter was never covered, and I found that unfair; an entire episode depicted their plight, and I feel it should have been resolved, whether she was killed or left alive by Henderson.Any show that can make a person sympathize with someone while viciously rooting against them (i.e. Logan) is a stupendous show.  24 delivers all of that and more, with its best season to date.9/10"
"I loved this season of 24. I loved almost everything about it, even the death scenes. I felt like nobody was safe, and anybody could die! I especially loved the episode where everyone is trapped in C.T.U. with the nerve gas everywhere. I also loved the surprise ending with Jack being taken hostage by the Chinese who were still after Jack from season 4. I highly recommend this season to all fans of 24. And I just saw the season six trailer. I've watched it over three times and I can't wait."
"I am watching each season of 24 on Amazon Prime Video and thoroughly enjoy each season. The twists and turns in each story are amazing, plus the shows give you mystery, action, love, betrayal, and so much more. It can take some time to get through an entire season because there ARE twenty-four 45 minute episodes. But whatever time you have to devote to this series is well worth it."
"I'm a fan what can I say.  I just watched seasons 1-5.  5 was one of my favorites, Jack seems to be going rogue more, the president is a despicable character.  The various sub plots are on the verge of repulsive but the writers reel it in or at least end them with Jack Bauer justice.  This season you should watch."
By now I've gotten into 24 pretty deep. I like the intensity of this real time format. I really enjoy watching Jack save the world.
"""24"" is like Red Bull--once you've had it you're addicted. The fifth season of ""24"" revolves around one central mystery: who killed an ex-president and how is Jack Bauer connected to the assassination? It's a thrilling season--probably the best since the first season--and it comes to a stunning conclusion that will be answered in January of 2007. Interestingly after having watched ""Casino Royale"" its clear that the new Bond film was inspired by shows like ""24"" which were, in turn, inspired by early Bond and some of the newer spy thrillers out there. There are a number of twists and turns in this season set my advice is NOT to read any reviews that summarize anymore of the plot if you haven't seen this season as there are some major spoilers in some of the reviews that follow.As usual Fox has put together a terrific DVD. This also features a brief episode ""prequel"" to the sixth season like previous sets had. We get a large amount of worthwhile commentary tracks including some with Emmy winner Kiefer Sutherland. There's also a summary of the season included as well athough if you've watched the show (or are watching it now) it won't really provide anything new. Th ""100 Episode Reel"" is a pretty useless extra -- basically a clips compilation.Different places are offering different exclusives. If you purchase it here you can download a free episode from Unbox (at least during the Holidays) while Target also offers a limited edition bonus disc for this set with additional featurettes on the show. Regardless of whether you buy it here at amazon.com or elsewhere this set features plenty of extras including an examination of the wonderful Presidential retreat featured in the show, a good featurette on the stellar work by the cinematography on the show, a featurette on the supporting actors on the show as well as extended and deleted scenes. I haven't had a chance to dig through all the bonus material yet but it what I have checked out looks really, really good.This set is packaged in the thinpak holders with two discs per holder so the accordian style packaging has been abandoned for this thinner packaging. This is a terrific set for an outstanding season of the series.What I would love to see if Keifer Sutherland and Donald Sutherland featured during a season."
great acting.  Lot of cliff  hangers.  good direction. absorbing - couldn't stop watching it.  i would recommend it to anyone.
"While Season One of 24 focused much of its attention on President David Palmer, Seasons 2-4 saw the Oval Office by and large take a back seat to the missions of Jack Bauer and CTU.  However, Season Five brings some of the attention back to the sitting U.S. President (this time Charles Logan) and ends up with a much more well-rounded storyline.For a basic (non-spoilery) plot summary, a group of Russian terrorists threaten to release canisters of nerve gas in the U.S., leading Bauer to be reprieved from his thought-to-be death in order to help stop the crisis.  As CTU begins investigating the terrorism, however, it quickly becomes clear that the terrorists are working with a high-ranking government official, and the conspiracy begins to be unraveled.To be honest, at first I was skeptical of all the focus on President Logan, as didn't like his character and wasn't sure that he could command the camera as well as his predecessor Palmer.  However, by the end of the season, Logan is easily the most enjoyable/interesting character on the show.  His acting, along with his wife, chief of staff, and head of security, really gives the show the Presidential presence it lacked since that first season.Of course, there is still more than enough of Jack Bauer and his fellow CTU agents (Audrey Rains, Bill Buchanon, Edgar Stiles, Chloe O'Brien, etc.) to go around, which means that intense drama ensues in every single episode.  The writers have an amazing way to take a character that looks like a creep (think Tony Almeida and George Mason in the early seasons) and, by the end of a few episodes, have him become a noble hero, and that tradition continues in this season as well.The only ""knock"" I have on this season is that the cliffhanger endings of each episodes aren't quite as shocking (e.g. Nina Myers doesn't appear out of nowhere).  However, I think that was more of a creative choice by the writers, as the story is actually more coherent that any season besides the first one.  Instead of seemingly changing the plot of the show with every episode, Season Five slowly crescendos until the big finale.So, fans of 24 can purchase this season with confidence knowing that they will still get their action, drama, suspense, and some great twists and turns along the way."
"If I had a friend Like MacGyver, than I would have try Survival Island and we would win all the money."
MacGyver can work his way out of anything with his knowledge of physics.  He is a master of problem solving.  I think everyone would enjoy seeing his stories.
"As usual, MacGyver is as exciting as ever."
James Bond minus the adult stuff.  Great show that shows the mind is still the best weapon.  Sure there is some liberal stuff thrown in but it is family friendly.  And who can't resist the MacGyverisms as you think could that work.  Maybe not but it will make the kids think and want to experiment.  Good stuff for the whole family.
What happened with Tony and the plague he was dying from.  HELP!  It's killing me to know!!!!!!!!!!
"NCIS changed in third season..and gotten strongerAt the end of season two, Kate was shot and died. Season three handles her death in the openning two parter ""Kill Ari"" which also introduces the audience to Ziva David (Cote de Pablo) and the new NCIS director (Lauren Holly).The change comes in many ways, Gibbs seems harder after Kate's death and it shows during the season, which builds to the two part season finale ""Hiatus""...a cliffehanger to open season four. all the character grew from Abby, Ducky, Mcgee and especially Tony.Most say change is bad, for this show is GOOD and we the audience reap the benifitsBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
We have watched the first and second season and we love the series.  We are now watching the third season and just like the first two we love the NCIS Team and the plots are excellent.
"Please see earlier rant on season 4.  I like that they do not always end on a shocker, sometimes they just quietly say good bye.  It can be so hard to replace characters but they have a knack for it.  Good season for sure."
"What is there to say about NCIS?LGG..slappin the back of peoples's heads.Abby..man what a great show.I watch this every Tuesday night,though Los Angles is better."
Started watching NCIS marathon on USA Channel (had never watched the show) and got hooked.  I have since purchased every season through Amazon and am enjoying every episode.  Great show.
Love having the Instant View feature on Amazon.com. I have used this feature many times and will do again. Would highly recommend to friends and family.
"as one of their own is shot and killed by the terrorist Gibbs has been hunting Ari.  The season also shows how the different NCIS members are dealing with this tragic loss in a two part episode Kill Ari.  This in turn leads to the new characters, Ziva David and the new NCIS Director (who has more than a little history with Gibbs).This all blends in well and the new members of the team pick up right where they left off.  With all the quirkiness and fun that they have in each show, it only helps to show much the actors/actresses have grown together and it makes NCIS one reason that i love to watch not only this show.  But others of the same caliber.  I am looking forward to season four as well as the 3rd season ended in a particular way.  It leaves a lot of things open for the following season.But it also answers a few questions before the season is up like Gibbs past and how that affects him in his job today.  I love all the characters in the show-Abby, Ducky, Dinozo(sp), ""Probie"", Ziva and the like.  As each of them has their various moments throughout the season from killing an undercover cop, to a prisoner dying in custody or a mentally deranged ex-boyfriend that just won't go away.Along with some cool special features, NCIS is a show that is best watched from the beginning so that you get the full effect.  So buy the 1st seasons and start from there.  By the time you get to season 3 you'll be well versed and know what all the buzz is about.  NCIS is the real deal when it comes to TV shows period."
"It is a well-done TV series that can absorb cast changes and continue to deliver excellent shows.  NCIS Season Two ended with the shocking murder of Agent Caitlin Todd.  Season Three opens with two major cast additions.  Cote de Pablo joins the team as the beautiful and dangerous Israeli Mossad Agent Ziva David, while veteran actress Lauren Holly, as Jenny Shepard, becomes the new director of NCIS.The changes put iconic Senior Agent Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) in the awkward situation of working in a new agent while getting used to a new boss who is a former love interest.  The rest of the team, still grieving for Caitlin, are slow to embrace Ziva but will be won over by her obvious competence, and by her hilarious efforts to master American slang.  Wisecracking Agent Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly)in particular will find that Ziva forces him to raise his game in a way that Caitlin never quite did.The exciting two-part season opener resolves the still-open case of Agent Todd's murder.  A two-part season ender places Gibbs' service with NCIS at risk.  The audience will learn more about Gibbs' past while contemplating another season-ending cliff-hanger.  In between, the team will handle serial killers, terrorists, and kidnappings with its usual mixture of brisk police procedural and entertaining repartee.  Six special features about the making of the show are included in the DVD set.  ""NCIS: The Third Season"" is very highly recommended to fans of the series."
"Season two ended with the murder of Caitlin Todd by the double agent Ari.The NCIS team is not going to allow this to go unpunished and the first two shows deal with this.Former Mossad intelligence officer Ziva David's replacement of Caitlin is not without problems as the team deals with both loss and acceptance.Complicating matters is a new director that has a romantic past with Gibbs.This season the Director of NCIS moves out of the shadows and into the light.  From now on, the Director is a full-fledged character and an important part of the story.Tony, Tim, Abby, Ducky and Jimmy are perfect in their roles.Jethro is boss, maverick and teacher while being larger than life.The cases are engrossing, complex and intelligent.The on-going interactions and personal stories support the show and fit the characters.This is an excellent series and this is an excellent season."
"This is one of very few current TV shows which is worth my time to watch. Most of the shows on TV now are vulgar, violent, unfunny or intent on pushing an offensive social or sexual agenda - even the so-called animated comedies. Even the game shows are leaning way Left (Jeopardy clues etc.). Most Reality shows are just plain stupid and fall into the above description as well. Though NCIS is often more GP than G rated, it has great characters and good plots."
This said it was used but you couldn't tell. The box had just a little wear on the corners other then that it looked new. Would order from them again.
Great storylines and very believable great i would recommend it to anyone over the age of 18 years and love the show
"It was rough enough for the fans of NCIS to lose Kate Todd by having Ari Haswari snipe her at the end of Season 2.  So, starting Season 3 off by showing Kate's murder from Ari's POV is a little rougher.  But the two episodes that start off Season 3 of NCIS--the two part ""Kill Ari"" episodes--really bring up a subject in this series that hadn't been fully fleshed out.  Obviously, these two episodes allow the regular characters to come to grips with the loss of Kate--the irony of Kate's ghost talking to Ducky and Ducky not talking back to the ghost, the overall story of how the survivors all see Kate.  McGee seeing a superwoman, Abby seeing Elvira, Tony being Tony in seeing Kate (That schoolgirl outfit), and Gibbs seeing Kate as he last saw her--with a hole between her eyes.  Just as obviously, ""Kill Ari"" allows for the introduction of Cote De Pablo's Ziva David, the Mossad/Masada agent liased to NCIS in the wake of Kate's death and Lauren Holly's Jenny Sheppard--Gibbs' former partner/lover who rose beyond working the field to the NCIS director's job.But my observation after a couple of viewings of this box set is that the underlying story of the season is the revelations about the history of Leroy Jethro Gibbs.  For much of the first two seasons, Mark Harmon's ""tough, no-nonsense investigator"" (To quote the liner notes on the set) has always had an understated sense of humor that has allowed him to smile quitely at the office interaction between the members of the team while presenting his harder face.  But that exterior begins to crack in the ""Kill Ari"" episodes; the mystery surrounding Jethro's background begins to unfold as Ari murders Kate, then takes his shot at Abby and captures Dr. Mallard.  This is what starts leading Jethro to being close to Ziva--maybe no one notices, but because of the information that she uncovered about Jethro and fed to her half-brother Ari, Officer David feels partially responsible for Kate's murder.Through Season 3, we start getting clues to who Jethro is and what he keeps from everyone--the flask that we see at the end of ""Under Covers"", his continued attraction towards redheads (It certainly is no coincidence that Holly/Sheppard is a redhead), and the subtleties of his relationship with Ziva--forged in an oddly shared tragedy.  Of course, much of all that goes on in the season comes to a head in the ""Hiatus"" two-parter at the end of the season.  We find out why Gibbs is what he is, how many of his actions have prepared DiNozzo for running the team and prepped Tim for being an agent; and how the discoveries affect his relationship with Dr. Mallard and Director Sheppard.As always since this series started, the performances are stunning.  Mark Harmon continues to embody the toughness and instincts of Jethro, but also had to be very nuanced as Gibbs' painful history comes out.Michael Weatherly's Tony DiNozzo continued being the second coming of David Addison (my usual Moonlighting aside), but Tony had to face growing up and being a decision-maker/leader (""Bait""), and had a difficulty through this season that he hadn't had in the previous two--ZIVA.Cote De Pablo flipped the dynamic of the team.  As Ziva, Cote brought a much more formidable presence to the squad.  In the first two seasons, Tony could get Kate off-balance with his remarks and his stunts, offending her Catholic schoolgirl sensibilities.  In the third season, Ziva--partially because of her background, partially because it was just HER--was able to get Tony off his feed more than he thought possible.  An example of this--aside from her driving, or her mangling of slang--came up in ""Probie"", when she was able to get Tony to reveal why he was receiving calls from a sperm bank.  De Pablo was able to affect a very cool and very canny customer in Ziva.  Many viewers are always going to miss Sasha Alexander, but Cote is a wonderful fit.Sean Murray's Tim McGee is still a wonderful work in progress; the nerd-boy field agent who continues to get tortured by DiNozzo in a big-brother/little-brother fashion.  He still seems over his head at times, eager to please Gibbs (Or at least keep Jethro from popping him one in the back of the head--isn't it funny how The Head Slap has become one of the show's many trademarks?).  Plus, there's whatever seems to be going on in his private life, whether or not it's with Abby.Of course, what can be said about Pauley?  Perrette is a scene-stealing wonder on screen, especially in Abby's lab when she's mainlining the ""Kaff-Pow"" or getting Bert to do what he does (Her stuffed hippo--YEAH, THAT ONE).  Plus, we get surprised by Abby's ability with duct tape (""Frame Up"") and her temper in general (""Bloodbath"").David McCallum's Dr. Mallard continues to be the second coming of Jonathan Quayle Higgins, though not as prissy as Robin Masters' major domo.  Ducky continues to tell his stories while working his was through the cadavers.  Plus, we get another visit from Nina Foch as Ducky's mom late in the season, getting a surreal moment when she's visiting the NCIS HQ.Many people thought the introduction of Jenny Sheppard as fluff.  Given the underlying story of the season, Lauren Holly's character was actually needed.  Jenny became an insight to Gibbs' relationship issues and why he stays operating as an investigator--basically, she knows certain things about Jethro that his squad aren't privvy to--though as it turns out, she doesn't know the whole story (Until ""Hiatus"").The good guest shots in this set have to start with Sasha Alexander, and her completion of the Catlin Todd storyline.  Her ghost appearing in various forms to the team members was striking (Of course, her schoolgirl outfit in Tony's vision was typical Tony).  Rudolf Martin's Ari Haswari was brilliant--slick, dangerous, deceptive and unstable.  I found myself regretting Ari's storyline being completed--he could have been Wo Fat to Gibbs' McGarrett (Hawaii Five-O reference).  It's always fun when Jessica Steen drops in to trade remarks with Weatherly as Paula Cassidy.  Michael Bellisario's turn as Abby's lab assistant is a comical and dangerous turn.  Finally, we can't forget Muse Watson's introduction in the ""Hiatus"" episodes as Gibbs' mentor when he joined NIS, Mike Franks.  Franks' amusement at the changes--the female director in particular--are tempered by his having to fill in many of the blanks for Gibbs when Jethro is recovering from amnesia.Ultimately, the season of change that is NCIS Season 3 is a storytelling wonder--full of the humor and action that has been the staple of the series since it's beginning, but also the undercurrent of melancholy that permeates this season.  The loss of Kate really becomes the latest in a series of painful losses for Gibbs--but we never realize it until the end of the season."
We love NCIS and all the seasons are great.  Anyone who enjoys the characters will like this season.  Beware of scenes in the autopsy room.
"Season Three lacks the edge that the first two seasons had, but the characters remain complex and the plots, unpredictable--except for the demands of the formula.  Visually and auditorially effective."
"It is Doctor Who (Classic) Season 1 what else is there to say? If you are a true Doctor Who fan than you can not miss watching these classic, see all of its humble beginnings.Only thing we have seen that is a problem, is that there if several seasons missing, it would be nice to watch every Doctor Who up to date today."
"I had always heard and read about Doctor Who's &#34;early years&#34;, but had never watched.  What a pleasant surprise.  This enterprise has been a winner since the beginning.  I've got a lot of shows to watch!!"
"My first Dr. Who was Tom Baker back in the 1980s. I watched every episode and even taped them to watch over and over.  When many years later I found the early ones I laughed because they were so silly and the technology was hysterical, cardboard, plastic tape, logic errors, and then I realized that they were made in the  1960s and were made for children.  Funny, I never thought of it as a children's show.  I was nearly 50 when I first watched and it grabbed me instantly!  So now I am over 80 and I still love it.  Even these funny old ones.  A truly wonderful show for any age."
The Doctor is the longest running si fi on television and there is little dout as to why. It's great.
"The older Dr. Who series always has a theatre quality to it. Tom Baker is the Doctor I grew up with, so it feels good to stop by and see these episodes again. This one features Romana, one of the better companions I feel (though she was kind of forced on the Doctor).Generations today always want a female Time Lord (ok by me), and well, there you go. Romana is a Time &#34;Lady&#34;. She's as smart as the Doctor, but lacks the experience he has traveling the universe.  She also seems to usually be very calm in a tight situation against his silly antics some times. They make a good pair.So if you ever wanted to see what a female Time Lord (excuse me, Lady) might be like, check out these episodes."
It is great filling in some of the blanks of what happened to that character or how did the doc meet this character! it would be great if you would get more missing episodes .
The best and lonest running sifi on tv ever. I have been a fan since 1970s. I think my wife loves it more them myself.
enjoyed all episodes of season 16 I only hope it continues with 2014(season 56) cant wait for it to appear
The writing in this season is amazingly well done. As is the acting. The character actors playing the bad guys and the heroes accompanying the Doctor are top notch.
"I have watched Dr. Who for years and enjoyed these early ones.  The thing I liked the best about this Dr. Was the way he would get confused and say &#34;Oh dear&#34; all the time.  He is very sweet, and I loved him just because he was Dr. Who.  Since it was a children's show, this might has had a lot of appeal to a child. for myself, I tend to forget it was started for children, and watch it avidly every time."
A great show about the Cybermen.  The episode centers around the tomb of the cybermen and the old look of them is pretty cool.  I only wish there were more episodes in the AMAZON library.
I appreciate technology and seeing the dreams fot the future.  I will watch additional Extreme Engineering seasons.  thank you for tne presentation.
"The series is in the older square video version.  Made for the older TV types, but it's still a great series.  Inspirational and mind boggling.  Some of the amazing things they come up with are absolutely incredible."
These guys are great and they have a fantastic team. There have been a couple of knock-off shows that weren't even in the same galaxy as the Mythbusters. I would give 7 stars if I could!!
"I've been a Mythbusters fan for a long time and while I'm still not used to the US narrator (coming from the UK where it is narrated by a Brit) I made my way through all the Mythbusters series again on Amazon Prime.The show takes us through those things we always thought we knew about but often didn't. Watching the whole seasons through, it is obvious that while Adam and Jamie were younger in this season they were also a lot angrier at each other. Perhaps they learned each others quirks as the seasons progressed but it is interesting to go back to the early days. You can also view how the budget for the show started increasing over time as their initial experiments were low cost and generally done near the shop, now they have massive explosions in man made lakes and mining quarrys.I recommend this show to my friends and it is often discussed in the work place. Everyone with an interest in science, explosions and humour should be watching this show."
These guys are a little bit crazy.  It is a fun series to watch.  You never know what they are going to do.
I've always enjoyed Mythbusters. Glad this show has gone as long as it has because I can always pull up an episode and be entertained even though I've seen most of them before.
"Probably the best children's show since Mr. Rogers Neighborhood. I wish they'd kept it going. This show has not one moment of anything I ever worry about my children watching. It's wholesome, educational, and actually interesting (lots of kids shows fail hard on that last one). My favorite thing is that unlike Dora the Explorer or Diego, no one *ever* encourages the audience to be loud. Also, while they do &#34;play Blue's Clues&#34; in every episode, the shows are not all the same. The structure changes slightly each time, which is fantastic. To get what I mean by that, try watching an episode of the exceedingly vapid Animal Mechanicals for a comparison...it's painful."
"My 2 1/2 yr old granddaughter who is only allowed limited TV time, is quite the connoisseur of children's shows.  Blues Clues is one of her favorites, and explains to me what is going on, and which host is on the show (apparently Steve went away to college)."
This is great for my grandchildren.  As an educator I know how important it is to encourage children to think and problem solve.  That is exactly what this show does.  My 22 month old twin grandchildren love it and it is the only show they are allowed to watch.
My grandbaby loved this show very much. She still looks for spots all over the place. She was mezmarized totaly.
Really? have you ever met a kid who didn't like watching this show whether with joe now or steve in the past?
"Blue's Clues has been around for well over a decade, but this 90's gem still shines in contemporary times with content that rivals any other children's programming today.  Educational and at a level that is attractive to a wide range of ages, Blue's Clues is a staple for educational / enjoyable children's shows."
"Granddaughter, age 5, can't get enough of Blues Clues Season 1.  I must say tho that when she viewed later seasons that changed Steve's role to another guy, she didn't like it.  So she watches the seasons with the original Steve over and over."
"So glad Blues Clues is on Amazon Prime!! My kids love it :) Thank you so much Amazon! Just wish y'all had other shows, like Little House On The Prairie, and all os the seasons of Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman."
I love this program.  The kids get so involved in the entire show. I really chuckle as the little ones really think they can be interactive.
"My 3-year-old son likes Blue.  His attention span is still pretty short, so he doesn't usually make it through an entire episode.  But, he repeats &#34;a clue!  a clue!&#34; often throughout the day."
"Good, clean, moral show. Teaches them a lot and not just wasting time watching useless junk.  Good for kids and fun for adults too"
"I'm not crazy about my son watching TV, but I make an exception for Blue's Clues. It is very sweet and my son loves it."
Very instructional and cute. Both my 7 year old and 1 1/2 year old love the show! More seasons for Prime members to stream!!
My daughter (5) really enjoys this show. It's colorful and interactive. She gets to help Blue (the dog) solve problems.
Such fun and so educational. Perfect show for toddler.  I love to watch the learning. Highly suggest this show for supplemental learning.
Awesome tv series. My son loves blue clues. Wish it was on more often. He likes then one where Blue talks in the videos too
My 2 and 3 year old grandsons love Blue's Clues.  I bought Season 1 and downloaded it to my Kindle Fire.  They like to sit in Nana's lap and watch Blue and Steve....and it gives Nana a good excuse to hold and rock the boys.
"Steve is a genius with children -- he really knows how to elicit their feedback and engagement with the story, and it never feels like he is above his audience.  And it is not too jarring or obnoxious like some children's shows can be."
"There are a lot of kids' shows that are super, super annoying.  This one is cheesy, but it is sweet, and I especially love Steve.  I love how this show teaches kids about deduction and gives them the chance to solve mysteries."
i grew up watching blues clues and now my daughter can enjoy the great music and teachings from fun blue
This is a great edicational show. My kids have watched the entire run of blues clues. They love to watch blue and Steve
"My children love this show. I will give a great example from my four year old from last week. We come to a stop sign and she reads S T O P and says that spells stop. We were really impressed, we have been working on letters for quite a while now, but she could comprehend  stop means stop. We  asked her if she learned it in K-3. She said no she learned it on blues clues. Just a side note I know some people are going to read this and say. Well if he didn't have his kid in day care they would be smart... or something of that ilk. Our children are in a small Christian school and they didn't have enough teachers so my wife became a full time volunteer to help the kids. I'm not a fan of preschool, I do not sit in judgment of those who do. It's just a personal choice for us. Back to the show my children have learned so much from this show. hope this helps."
"Our two year old loves watching Dora. If your kid loves shows like Bubble Guppies, Backyardigans, Umizoomies then this show is probably right for you."
Well if my two year old had a say she would give it ten stars. I think the show has gotten better since it's introduction. I don't mind her watching it at all and the fact that she surprised me by counting to 5 in Spanish says a lot.
What is bad about Dora.  Not one thing.  This is my grand children's all time favorite.  The first thing out of their mouths are &#34;I need Dora &#34;. Recommend to anyone
"I enjoyed watching Dora and Boots and  the Gang with my Granddaughter on Saturday morning.  The plot lines are simple and easy for her to understand, (she is a preschooler), and she was really engaged.  She loved being a part of the story when Dora asked her to participate.  She was so involved in what was going on.  We had a lot of fun, and we will enjoy watching it again very soon.  We love Dora!!!!"
The colors are bright and cheerful. Great story lines.kkeps a child's attention while teaching them life lessons.My grand child really learns a lot from this show
The little short videos is just right for her.  It helps her learn to count and limited Spanish as well as sequencing. Very helpful for learning to read.
"My 2 year old grand daughter loves Dora and all her friends!  It's a very positive toddler/kids show. It's also educational, fun and entertaining."
My 4 yr old loves Dora and always enjoys going on adventures. She also like to speak other languages and thinks it is so cool.
Entertaining and informative for the young minds. Granddaughter already is counting to 10 in Spanish and has picked up several words (colors).  She is only 2.
"I believe it's a very positive show, she can learn both languages, English and Spanish and also, about friendship! Isn't that awesome. Only three seasons are on prime but its really worth the cost."
"dora teaches problem solving, spanish, manners and fairness.  my son loves this show, as most kids do, but i feel good letting my son watch this show, because he always comes away learning something and the show is very interactive, it prompts kids to talk back to the tv and answer questions and solves problems."
"My son loves this show. He is always asking ""more Dora more Dora"" I like how the show will pick up where u last left off"
"No matter what episode it is, my son has been hooked on this cartoon since he was a little baby... he's learn alot of words and general knowledge watching this..."
"I love the ease to remember songs for my kids, and that it helps them work on their memory. It's got rally cute characters too. I so like that it teaches Spanish too"
I am a nanny an the little girl love this show. Every time we go shopping she screams backpack (what she calls Dora) when she see it.
My kids enjoy this show.  I like that it's got some educational value and isn't annoying for me to watch with them.
My girls ages 3 and 4 absolutely love Dora and they enjoy these episodes from season 2. They stream easily on the Roku.
"I have two young children and we love almost everything Dora! The shows always have some element of learning,  My girls have actually recognized Spanish words in books now that they have heard Dora speak them."
My grandson LOVES Dora the Explorer and he learns a bit of Spanish too which really isn't the goal of watching this program.
Both my sons love watching Dora. The language is appropriate for 3-5 year old kids and boots is an awesome addition to the characters.
"My granddaughter just can't get enough of Dora. Two years old and it's perfect for her..she is learning a little bit of spanish, and the stories are a wonderful learning tool."
"Who doesn't love Dora? My three-yr old granddaughter is being expertly prepped for K-2. Just as my previous four grandkids. The vocal response to Dora's questions say it all. Five stars, Dora, five stars"
My grandsons love Dora.  I find myself watching right along with them and learning new words.  If you have a preschooler please try Dora.  She is fun and entertaining.
Great show for young kids. My thee year old son loves Dora & Diego. Educational & entertaining for kids & will make them want to sing.
Educational and entertaining to the grandkids. Would recommend for anyone with preschoolers. Hope to see more seasons in the future!
Good clean and colorful fun for a four old.  I can always be sure that she will be entertained as she learns about the world she lives in
She's so enthusiastic and has great adventures!  Our son and daughter both love Dora shows!  They're great enthusiastic fun and the kids learn a little too.
"My granddaughters, ages 5 and 3, can not get enough of Dora.  They ask to watch it every time they visit.  We love it because this show teaches the girls so much.  Would highly recommend this to all!"
"This series was always dependable.  It always resolved itself satisfactorily.  The characters were sensible, disciplined, and willing to have fun."
If you've never seen the franchise get the movie starring Kurt Russell first.Then get all 10 seasons(there is a boxed set of all 10).Nuff said!!!
"SG1 is everything a show should be, intelligent, funny, attractive- this is sci fi that deserves to stick around for a long time."
"I found it to be an enjoyable series though the recognizable science was a bit thin. Towards the end it seemed to me the writers had explored pretty much what could be done in the premise of the show. It was a good idea to stop when they did. If you like science fiction, I think you will like this one."
Oh the finale!! Did you get the feels? I did. Man I cried once(on the inside) when I re-watched the most memorable of episodes. Ahh! Why did you have to leave us!!
"A great show that will make you laugh, cry and cheer.  Fantastic acting and loveable characters.  What more do you need in a show."
"Stargate  SG-1is one of those shows that the good guys win most of the time.Lots of action, Lots of humor if you pay attention.I would recommend to most anyone how wants Sifi, action or adventure"
what an episode. its episodes like this that make me realize that SG-1 isthe best scifi ever. I hope all feel the same!
"Good cast, good stories. Well directed and well-written.  And of course Richard Dean Anderson is always good even if this role is definitely different than his more famous one Angus MacGyver."
"Always buy this series, and am sorry that it is, as a weekly show, ending.Therefore it is good to be able to have the last season (I have all the others) as it is one of the best in the field - science fiction - apart from old faithful Star Trek. Always miss Richard Dean Anderson, that wry and handsome wit, but Shanks and Browder, let alone Claudia Black, what a terrific actor! more than make up for his loss. I always wish more of Amanda Tapping's abilities apart from sheer mathematics that she is forced by plot to come out with at least four or five times per episode could be utilized in more interesting directions, but she is the greatest also. Look forward to her in Stargate Atlantis.Stargate SG-1 season 10 is a worthy product and has been added to my collection with great satisfaction.Linda Sheean"
"This show is fantastic!  I love how they wind ancient culture and Myths into futuristic events!  It's a lot of fun to watch, especially if you're into ancient myths and such."
"Stargate was a good movie and an even better series.  Very imaginative and well acted.  Recently, I rewatched the series and enjoyed it very much."
Love the characters and seeing them as they develop over time. Very fun show. Episode 200 is awesome. Love it
"In case you aren't familiar with the show, this is the final season DVD set.It's a TV show that lasted 10 seasons and gave the viewers a realistic world of science fiction that often made you think if it's really fiction.Imagine finding an ancient artifact that allows you to travel light years away to another planet and explore the unknown. What you discover is fascinating, exciting and dangerous; We are not alone and we are not as advanced species as we once thought.I've been a Stargate SG-1 fan since the beginning.This DVD will complete my collection as I already seen all the episodes.  This is for my personal archive of what I consider the best Science Fiction show.I have been a long time fan of Science Fiction.  I watched various Star Trek Series, Space 1999, The Avengers, Doctor Who, just to name very few.I loved them all for what they gave me; a momentary escapism.  They all have given me a place where I can immerse myself and enjoy the wonder of another place and time.Then came the Stargate SG-1.  I'm sure many will argue what is the most influential SciFi of all times.  But if you ask me what show gave me the most satisfying and lasting impression as the best SciFi, it's Stargate SG-1.I have to thank the writers and the chemistry of actors who made it the most enjoyable show."
"Stargate went ten seasons, this alone should tell you how good the show was. The military man, the alien warrior, the nerd and the sexy scientist. Get it them all and you will have entertainment for some time to come."
This series is very adventure filled. Not only that but we love the concept of being able to travel to other worlds through a star gate worm hole. How awesome it that! in just seconds you're there. We watched several episodes a night and couldn't wait til the next time we were able to watch. It was fun to see what the team was up to next and what lie ahead on the next planet. You definitely won't be bored with this series.
"I was very pleased to find this on Criterion's pre-release list, but not surprised - it's just the sort of little-known cinematic gem that Criterion does wonders with. In fact, I've been looking for a copy of this for some time, having first seen Eddie Coyle years and years ago, the memory of the film's stark realism and mood etched in my mind like few others. This is definitive 70's Noir and a title fully worthy of a pull-out-all-the-stops release that Criterion consistently provides.  What a fine addition to the Criterion title catalogue, the choice reflecting - as usual - an impeccable sense of film history on the part of Criterion's staff."
"""Eddie doesn't rob banks...He's about this high in the bunch but he gets around more than any man I've ever seen,"" says Dave Foley (Richard Jordan), a baby-faced Boston cop about as amoral as the wiseguys he hunts. Eddie Coyle (Robert Mitchum) is a worn out, two-bit gunrunner. He provides untraceable revolvers when required. He draws the line at machine guns. Eddie is honorable in his way. He loves his family. He's just a low life who isn't all that shrewd. The fix he's in, because he can't take any more jail time, is what this superb Peter Yates' movie is all about.""Look. I'm gettin' old, y'hear?"" Eddie tells a young hood who deals in machine guns. ""I spend most of my life hangin' around crummy joints with the punks drinkin' the beer, eatin' the hash an' hot dogs and watchin' the other people go off to Florida while I'm sweatin' how I'm goin' to pay the plumber. I done time when I stood up but I can't take no more chances. Next time it's goin' to be me goin' to Florida."" Now he's facing more prison time for foolishly agreeing to drive a getaway car when he should have asked his friends some questions. He'll do just about anything to cut a deal for no jail time. He's nearly 50. He doesn't want his wife to go on welfare, doesn't want his three kids made fun of because their old man is doing time. He's squeezed by Dave Foley to inform...and Eddie decides he'll rat a little. He's too believing to understand he might be tagged for ratting big time. It's all betrayal, but Eddie doesn't really understand betrayal. All those friends of Eddie's make us wary every time we meet them: Scalise (Alex Rocco), who robs banks, sometimes violently; Jackie (Steve Keats), the dangerous dealer in stolen machine guns; Dillon (Peter Boyle), owner of a low-life bar who knows more about things than Eddie does.The movie looks as hopeless as the Boston weather. It's the cold end of fall, filled with drab, chill days where parking lot asphalt is always wet. We're into Eddie's life in the low lane, where the anchors in the crummy strip malls are a tired Woolworth's and Barbo's Furniture Store. It's a lousy life and it belongs to Eddie Coyle. ""Have a nice day.""Director Peter Yates sets up scenes -- an exchange of machine guns, a bank robbery, a family held hostage, a stakeout in a commuter train lot, a night on the town -- that are so naturally established that we might miss how skillfully they build the story and show us Eddie's life. We're never sure if things are as hopeless for Eddie as they seem. Yates keeps us on edge, and he adds layers of Eddie Coyle's sad and foolish trust.This is one of Robert Mitchum's best performances. Mitchum still looks like he might be a tough guy, but his Eddie Coyle is a man who has had the force of his life wrung out of him. He's been in the life forever. He does the jobs others ask him to. He doesn't ask very many questions. He's just not smart enough. Mitchum takes all the hard edges off his usual persona and gives us an aging loser whose life is on the skids, and who doesn't understand just how badly off he is.The Criterion release looks just fine. There is a commentary by Peter Yates."
"this is one of those individualistic and remarkable films that for some reason has slipped under or past the usual critical and viewer recommendations -- hat tip to a.o. scott for highlighting it as a critic's choice in the new york times. ""friends of eddie coyle"" is in that peculiar variant of film noir where ""good and evil"" have been entirely extracted from the narrative dynamic, leaving only the tactical calculations of characters swimming a turbulent world of existentialist gray. it only gradually becomes clear that some of these low lifes are thieves, some are gun runners, and some are cops, or how exactly the thieves and gun runners are connected, or that acquaintances are hit men, and hit men will, for a price, take down even those they invite to enjoy a hockey game. the narrative shifts back and forth between set piece bank robberies or gun purchases and one on one conversations in which the protagonists alternately manipulate, flatter, wheedle, bluff, coerce or inform on one another -- all filmed in a flat, clinical, procedural style strongly reminiscent jean-pierre melville's ""army of shadows"" (1969). the whole is knit together by the fate of eddie coyle, embodied by robert mitchum in an unsentimental but nuanced performance, who attempts to balance the demands of treasury cops (who might help him in a forthcoming sentencing for smuggling liquor) and the needs of armed criminals (who provide eddie's livelihood). the film is a grim and tragic examination of human beings who must negotiate trust and threat as part of their daily survival, and where the winners are those who can do the most reliable service for ""the man"" (or for ""uncle""); the weak are those who only have the weak to rely on."
"Mitchum is always spell binding & he is again.  As a kid ""Thunder Road"" became part of my psyche (saw at a drive-in).  The song - I will remember to my grave.  Keely Smith as his girl friend couldn't have been more seductive or more in love w/her moonshine runner.  Mitchum always managed to be in trouble no matter which side of the law he was on.  His classic detective films are hard to find - ""The Big Sleep"" & ""Farewell My Lovely"".  AGAIN why do most reviewers blab it all?  Paragraphs & paragraphs & paragraphs telling one about a film...ever so boring.  Me thinks these folks have too much time on their hands.  I digress...this film is certainly worth watching.  Impossible to notice other actors - Mitchum w/his sleepy eyes & conspicuous laid back attitude could charm the fur off a pussy cat..."
"Though often dismissed by critics as ""walking through"" his roles, Robert Mitchum) was perhaps Hollywood's most underrated actor.  True, many of his films were not worthy of his talent, but when he did get a good script (e.g. THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, HEAVEN KNOWS MR. ALLISON, CAPE FEAR), his performance was always mesmerizing.Arguably, Mitchum's finest screen performance can be found in THE FRIENDS OF EDDIE COYLE (1973), now available on DVD from The Criterion Collection.Directed by Peter Yates, who supplies audio commentary on the disc, the film is set in Boston and casts Mitchum as a small-time felon, a family man facing a 2-5 year sentence on a smuggling conviction.  His only hope of avoiding prison is to give an FBI agent (Richard Jordan) information that will help to bring down some bigger bad guys...like the men who have been on a bank-robbing spree and killed a teller during their last job.Mitchum's problem is that, if he ""rats"" on those guys, his life is not worth a plugged nickel.Peter Boyle co-stars in the picture, playing Mitchum's ""friend,"" a former felon who is now a bartender and also supplies confidential information to the Feds.Adapted from the novel by George V. Higgins by Paul Monash, this is a gritty, first-rate crime drama, shot in almost a semi-documentary style.  Mitchum's performance, particularly his first scene in which he explains to a young punk gun dealer how he got the nickname, ""Fingers,"" is unforgettable.The Criterion package contains a booklet of essays on Mitchum and the film. Michael B. Druxman"
"Stargate Atlantis in my opinion is the best of the SG franchise.  The characters are excellent...lots of action, wit and even wisdom!"
"As I've said in all my reviews, I love the Stargate shows SG-1 and Atlantis, not so Universe.  I like the way they spun off the whole Atlantis discovery as the foundation for extending SG-1 which was great, but ran it's course and was in decline at the end.  It allowed some new characters, albeit with familiar personalities, along with keeping alive some old favorites with vague tie in's to their ongoing lives as well as bringing Samantha Carter back for a season to head the program (in addition to all her guest appearances).  I think the 3rd season of Atlantis was its best.  I knew from the start it would have a shorter shelf life than SG=1 because the premiss had already been pretty thoroughly explored in SG=1. A whole new universe allowed for some new bad guys, but the SG teams and the predicaments they can get into are finite before they are like plots different show.  I enjoyed their greater familiarity with the ancient technology but being Hyperspace or Warp drives, the technology is simply a backdrop to the episode storyline and seasonal/show ones.  I couldn't have stood waiting as long watching Stargate for them to develop defensive technologies and fight the enemies effectively.  I enjoyed the show and season 3 was at its peak as it was becoming a formula rotated through the seasons by season 4 and season 5 it is hard to get enthused when it begins by them canning a long time character who was well liked by fans and characters, replacing her with someone that I would have enjoyed having run Stargate for two shows and then get eaten by a Raithe no matter how much they tried to make it fun watching him have to change his ways to deal with the realities of being in the field.  The characters had become familiar such that losing main ones was difficult in this season making for some heavy shows, but also began the rotation that made it less upsetting when one was lost.  The only thing that sort of always left me in question was how on Atlantis they dealt with exploring an entire Galaxy with a few SG teams while back in the Milky Way they had a ton.  I realize there were more finite resources in the beginning, but by season 3 they had the huge city fairly up and running and enough trade partners to support a much larger military presence which all things considered I think back home on earth they would have been cranking out as many starships as possible because in the big picture they would need a fleet not a couple of ships.  i know they added on, but over years given the stakes I believe an international governing body would be funding mass production of those things so there was always one by earth, one by Atlantis and others for missions and with force.  It is part of what started to become a little to familiar, the desperate situation with impossible odds solved by a miraculous discovery at the last minute.  Great for a show, or a movie, but when it becomes cyclical it eventually translates to a show formula and the interest just begins to wane.  I did appreciate the writing around the problems they faced were of their own making many times (waking the wraithe early, messing with the replicator programming, genetic experiments on the wraithe to make them human) and the moral questions they raise in parallel with the real world application of genetics.  How much knowledge is to much before we are dabbling in areas we don't have enough seem to be evolved enough to have in our hands as they represent to much power, to much danger.  But for Star Gate fans I think Atlantis was a comfortable spin off that allowed a few more years of enjoyment of their &#34;world&#34; but unlike the Star Trek franchise that dealt with all universes the &#34;world&#34; created via the stargates became to self contained limiting the growth of the plots.  Bottom line is by this season you know what your getting and enjoying it, where in the seasons to come it started to get old and thus the show faded away.  Good, even great for periods, but limited from the start by being set in the present.  Great run while it lasted."
Phenomenal set of writers who seem to know how to keep the series action packed and with characters who the audience enjoy watching.  Strongly recommended for the SCI-FI junkies in the world.
I love anything Stargate!!!!!  One of the very few scifi series left on tv.....sad  :o(
Season 3 is as exciting and suspenseful as season 1 and 2 even though I've watched this series before. Truly great Sci-Fi!
"I love this series. This is the third or fourth time through for me. The characters of John Shepherd, Tayla, Dr Weir, Ronan and Dr. Becket and Dr McKay are unforgettable. It is a wonderful space fantasy. Whenever I want to escape into another world I go to Stargate Atlantis. I imagine how cool it would be to travel to other worlds through a stargate/wormhole and meet other people who of course speak my language, English. The SG-1 series is good too and was the beginning of the Stargate series. In the beginning of Stargate Atlantis Jack O'Neil passes the torch to John Shepherd. Very cool indeed."
Clean and fun Sci-fi. Not as dark and mature as Stargate Universe. Most of this felt like a clear good vs evil. Excellent effects budget and decent acting for a TV Sci-Fi. This was probably the best season for this series.
They should've created feature films for release in theaters of these tales.I hope we'll see more of these actors in the future.
It is so good that i have watched it for a second time.  Just imagine if this were true.  Great cast.
"i have loved all the sg series. it can get a little slap stick every now and then, but its still one of the great series of the last few years"
"Tell us why you chose this rating? Well, there is really only one answer I can give, only one word that sums up my feelings about this show: yes."
Love this show and all the stargate series shows its a shame they only got 5 seasons because there was alot more you could do with the premise.
I really like Stargate Atlantis.  I like seeing the characters from the first Stargate series working with the current ones.
I'm a big fan of this series. The constant fight with the wraith is exciting and makes for good character development. No worries no spoilers here but expect Ann exciting season with very high stakes.
"Stargate Atlantis is a fun and intertaining series. Full of action, good characters and imagination. My husband and I both really love the series."
This is a great sci-fi fiction show for the whole family.  We enjoy watching it.  Very glad the whole show is on prime to view.
"This is by far the best season so far. I kept looking forward for nighttime to watch an episode.One thing I like about this season is that some episodes follow on the previous ones. In other words, many episodes are not standalone. Many viewers do prefer standalone episodes, and producers certainly do. For producers, having standalone episodes means a viewer can jump in and watch the series at anytime during the season. This has the benefit of increasing ratings. For some viewers, standalone episodes are also an advantage since they can watch and enjoy an episode without having seen any other episodes. I, on the other hand, prefer continuity, sort of like 24 Hours. For this reason, I thought this season of Stargate Atlantis to be the best.I do have a few comments about this season:1. Dr. Beckett dies in a very simple plot. I was really very disappointed. Beckett was one of my favorite characters, and I often wished he was given more of a principal role. The writers also did a lousy job in the episode in which he was killed. They could have killed him off in two or three one-hour episodes that followed up on each other, thus adding more suspense and thrill. On the other side of the coin, though, killing off a principal character also means that all characters on the show are susceptible to death--none are superhuman. We know James Bond never dies in his movies. However, next time a character is threatened with death in Stargate Atlantis, we will be glued to our seats, wondering whether he or she will die! `Death in the air' makes the episodes more suspenseful.2. The character of Teyla (Rachel Luttrell) has not been developed, and she does not have much to say that is interesting. She is also dressed up in a way to make her look sexy. Shouldn't she be wearing a uniform? Can you imagine a female soldier in Iraq wearing her outfit?3. Jason Momoa as Ronon is another underdeveloped character. Sometimes he is annoying. He also is sparsely dressed, being topless most of the time. Like Teyla, I would imagine he'd wear a uniform. Don't they ever get cold?4. Dr. Weir's (Torri Higginson) character is also weak. She should be given more principal roles. There are rumors that she might be replaced in upcoming seasons.5. There is too much Rodney in this season, and this gets to be annoying at times.6. In one episode, a ship full of ancients is found. They reclaim Atlantis, and basically kick out the Stargate team from the city, who all return back to Earth. However, in the second episode they are all killed. That was really bad storytelling. As one reviewer pointed out, couldn't an ""ancient"" or two have been spared and used as secondary characters in latter episodes? They could have helped explore the rest of the city and reveal its many secrets. We could have also known more about the ancients and their culture. Furthermore, their ship could have been recovered and used to fight the Wraiths. There's so much that could have been done with the surviving ancients that wasn't.7. The episode ""Common Ground,"" in which the Genii kidnap Sheppard and enclose him with a Wraith was fascinating. We discover that the Wraiths not only drain another creature of life, but can also give life as well. For the first time, a bond is formed between a Wraith and a human. Wraiths are shown to be human after all. Humans hunt and kill prey (animals) in order to survive. Wraiths kill humans because we are prey to them, and they need to feed on us to survive. Viewed in this context, aren't Wraiths and humans the same? It all boils down to survival of the fittest.The season ends with the city blasting off into space. Having lost all power, it just floats in space. I can't wait for season 4!"
"This is the best of the three shows (SG-1, Atlantis, and Universe).  Too bad they dorked with the actors in the last 2 seasons."
"Yet again another fantastic &#34;Gate&#34; series. Intelligently executed script, an almost perfect cast and just enough babes and bullets to keep you coming back."
the entire series from the first season through the final fifth season is a marvelous creation of imagination. I love the characters and a course the city with all it's amazing technology listening leo's be under comprehension in some cases shouldn't even be in a position. The monsters better created each week or dangers of the universe springs both in outer space in technology lovers races that they came in contact with. The rating the central 1. I enjoyed the up organic feel the race very similar to the movie series alien having that to organic look to the interiors of the ship and there insect always of preserving food and consuming the life force of human being
"I never watched this show on TV. I had heard about it but I couldn't add one more to my queue. Then the show ended after season 5, my shows went on hiatus for the summer, and I wanted a show to watch. I have to say, I'm not only glad I picked this show, I'm glad I actually waited until now. I blew through the first season real fast and thought maybe I'd take a break, except that didn't happen because of the nice cliffhanger at the end so immediately in went season 2.Like I said in the title, this show is like a drug. I blew through season 2 faster than the first season. They're out, they're on the run, the Fox River Eight. T-Bag is the villain you love to hate. Scofield is still the modern day MacGuyver. Sucre gets far more interesting. Burrows really is able to reveal his bad-@$$ nature, and the plot continues to thicken with ""The Company"". I'll warn you, you're not going to want to stop here, you might want to just get the entire collection and take a vacation so you can watch it all."
This is an addictive show. Suspense that leaves you wanting to fast forward to next week so you can find out what is going to happen next.
"More fun from the behind bars, okay they are on the run now, oops hope that doesn't spoil it for you!!"
"This is a very good second season. Granted they are not in Prison anymore. They broke out and are on the run with other prisoners. Added new people to the mix and they fit in well. This show has a lot of good action, drama and story.Has a lot of intense scences as well as surprises. The bond between the brothers is done well. The man that steals the Show is Agent Kellerman. A very good series to own."
"The first season of ""Prison Break"" was amazing and it solidified it as one of the best new shows on network television. When it ended, with the escape of 8 of the convicts; I wondered how they would keep the show going. Well, they did it...The 2nd season is different from season 1 in scenery and in story. And, I'm going to get this out of the way right now, it's not quite as good as season 1. The first season was smart, suspenseful, and entertaining. Season 2 is suspenseful and entertaining...But not a single episode on here captured the heart-pounding 2nd to last episode of season 1. Still, viewing all these episodes a 2nd time (I watched them all while they were airing); It's still an amazing show. When the show begins; Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller) and his brother Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) have successfully broken out of Fox River. Along with them are John Abruzzi (Peter Stormare), Fernando Sucre (Amaury Nolasco),David ""Tweener"" Apolskiss (Lane Garrison, who's had a recent run-in with the law himself), Theodore ""T-Bag"" Bagwell (Robert Knepper), Benjamin ""C-Note"" Miles Franklin, and Haywire. With the entire world knowing their faces, they ""Fox River 8"" begin running...With new character, F.B.I. man Alexander Mahone (William Fichtner) guessing their every move. This season develops the relationship between Michael and Sara, the doctor who aided the cons in their escape, and also makes you feel more for the characters. One amazing aspect of this show is that you actually like the characters and want them to succeed despite their wrongdoings. The best example I have of this is the character T-Bag, a convicted rapist & pedophile who is easily the most dangerous of the bunch. Many viewers of this show have a strong connection to T-Bag and love the character. This is not a result of good writing, but a result of good acting. Robert Knepper plays this character so well, you root for T-Bag to succeed. You don't want to see him killed off or shipped back to prison. The fact that the Emmy awards haven't even acknowledged Knepper is a complete travesty. If this was a movie, Knepper would be nominated for an Oscar. But all the actors are good and with season 2, they've only got better at playing the roles. They're gotten under their character's skin and have really became them. The chemistry between Miller and Purcell is terrific. You believe that they are actually brothers. Fichtner as Mahone is terrific as well. He has that icy stare and intenseness that John Malkovich has and does an amazing job as the sympathetic F.B.I. agent that you love to hate. Like I said, the show isn't as smart as season 1...There's many episodes where they seemed to make up things as they went along (Michael's tattoo has become a ploy and a plot device. The writer's can make new tattoos appear whenever they wish) and the way they handled the Haywire character could have been better. There were times when they disregarded him for several episodes, when really he should have been caught by episode 3. There's no way that Haywire could've remained out longer than Abruzzi. But the suspense factor is way up there. Every episode has me on the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen next (Even though, I already knew which makes it even more impressive). If you haven't jumped on the ""Prison Break"" bandwagon yet, you should...I missed the season 3 premiere last night and I truly want to cry, because I can't wait to see what happens next. When you have a TV show that can you get that pumped up, you know you've found something special...And ""Prison Break"" is damned special all right. Fine acting, terrific writing, and nail-biting suspense. I said this is my review for season 1 a long time ago, but I'm going to state it again. If this was a movie, you can bet that Oscars would be involved.GRADE: A"
"As the second season of Prison Break opens, things get moving along rather quickly.  Michael (Wentworth Miller), Linc (Dominic Purcell), Sucre (Amaury Nolasco), C-Note (Rockmond Dunbar), and John (Peter Stormare) have escaped from prison and are on the run.  After going their seperate ways, shady FBI Agent Mahone (William Fichtner) arrives on the scene with one main intention: stop Michael and Linc from escaping the country.  In the meantime, T-Bag (Robert Knepper) goes to some great lengths to get what he wants, and Captain Bellick (Wade Williams) is still hot on the brothers' trail.  The conspiracy that was apparent in season one is even more farther reaching here, as revelations are made that will cost everyone involved dearly, and by the end of the season, not everyone that has been here since the beginning will still be standing.  What makes Prison Break so good is that the show never relents from it's break neck pacing.  This could easily be a bad thing, but the minds behind Prison Break manage to keep the constant flow stable enough so you never know what to expect next.  Even with the major change of scenery for the main characters, the show stays more compelling than ever as it becomes a high octane game of cat and mouse.  Undoubtedly one of (if not the) best shows on prime time network television today (and on Fox), Prison Break just keeps getting better, and by the end of the season finale, you'll be salivating for more."
"It was interesting how the roles became reversed.  Michael is now the prisoner in one of the worst prisons possible and the brother is now the free man.  Talk about twist of fate.  I was excited to see T-bag back in the second season.  He's a mean, rotten man, but somehow he just grows on you.  You kind of believe there's some good in there, some where."
"Love this show. Plenty of twists and turns.really good, great cast and acting. Lots of great guest stars to keep it fun and interesting."
"I vaguely remember it the first time. There was a lot of hoopla and you weren't normal if you couldn't converse about each weeks episode. This time I was ill and decided to have a marathon. It all melted together. The actors,the script,music editors producers. it made me scream at the tv like an idiot and laugh like"" haywire"" and cry as though my brother was going to the chair!!!!! Wentworth is amazingly beautiful! eye candy. &lt;sorry> had to put that in! One of the funniest quotes I have ever heard came from Balak's mouth"" omg you are slower than a bunch of stutterers at a spelling bee"" just the visual made me crack up! the only unfortunate part is season two! I hope it gets better the episodes aren't as nail biting and a little predictable and I did see the second season before!! give my review later for 2.."
"Breaking out of prison is one thing.  Dealing with the inevitable and complicated fallout and consequences afterwards is another.In the second season of this series, the characters discover just how hard it is to regain a normal life, a life not spent on the run.  C-Note has a wife and sickly daughter who suffer to a degree because of him and he nearly kills himself.  T-Bag's twisted logic tells him that his former lover will take him back into her home, but he doesn't face reality.  Bellick thinks he can find the money but ends up imprisoned in a foreign country and has left Sucre's beloved woman locked up somewhere.Haywire ends up dead, as does Tweener, while Mahone and others involved in the conspiracy and the hunt create their own hell.Scofield and Burrows try to hide out in Panama with Sarah, but all goes asunder and Scofield is now in the hellish prison of that country.In such a bleak world, it's amazing that any of these people keep trying to carve out a life for themselves."
"I have kept up with Bones through the current season and I have to say that I think season 2 is my favorite season! The chemistry, the stories are especially excellent and enjoyable to watch!"
"My overriding impression of ""Bones Season 2"" is that perhaps Booth and Brennan were getting too close in season one, and forces needed to be put in place to put some distance between the two. The first was by replacing Jonathan Adams (Dr. Daniel Goodman) with Tamara Taylor (Dr. Camille Saroyan) as Brennan's boss, who, by the way, had a romantic relation with Booth when they were in New York. The second was to introduce a romantic interest for Brennan, in the form of FBI agent Tim Sullivan (Sully), who replaces Booth while he is sidelined for a psychiatric evaluation by the premier guest character on ""Bones"", Gordon, Gordon Wyatt, played by Stephen Fry.Wyatt and Booth have some of the most delicious scenes outside of the episodes where Booth and Brennan get close.In retrospect, it is just a bit hard to take the interchange between Brennan and Saroyan in the first few episodes. Booth is surprised at her arrival, and resists Saroyan's direction. I suppose the reason it's odd is because we all suspect from the outset that in the lab, and with Booth, Brennan will always be the alpha dog. After all, the show is named after her.Overall, I would say season 2 is as good as season 1, and better than season 3 (It is rated better than both seasons 1 and 3.) Season 1 had the ""getting to work together jitters"" and season 2 had the ""separation moves"". The main season 3 arc was simply not as good."
"The Bones tv series is a great show.  David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel work so good together and even though it is a crime drama, there are also plenty of light moments that will make you laugh.  I love it and hope this series goes on for many more seasons."
"I admit that I found myself caught up in the TV whirlwind that is Bones.  But with good reason a show that focuses on solving crimes via skeletal remains mixed with humor, sorta romance and danger.  It all equals a wildly addictive TV show that has you coming back for more with each episode watched.It stars David Borenaz and Emily Deschanel as partners working together.  Along Dr. Brennan and her crew of coworkers who are just as important to the show as the two stars in it.  All kinds of things take place in the 2nd season with more storylines resolved and new ones opened up.  They are just as addictive and compelling as the first season and they even have an addition to the team as a whole in a new director (Tamara Taylor) for the Jeffersonian.I love the way the season progresses with the different members of the team reaching new personal goals and other things (marriage (sorta), promotion).  It's exciting to see a show this good actually stick around for more than a minute.  I can only hope that Season 3 picks up right where this season ended on a very high note and full of possibilities this time around.  That i'm sure will have even more people flocking to check out this all around well written, directed and acted show in Bones."
"Bones is a great TV show. Not like about 90% of the Trash on TV.. It is fun to watch, and keeps you going.. If you want a good TV show. THis is one to get!!!!!"
"I hadn't watched Bones until I picked up the first season on DVD when I was looking for something different to watch. Now it's one of my favorite shows--much more fun than CSI, a little gross at times, but over all one of the best shows on the tube right now."
I think Bones is a very good show. I love all the characters and the chemistry between all of them is fun to watch.
Better than the first.  Know a bit more about the history of the characters and their motivations.  Dr. Seroyan is excellent addition.  You get a hint of grossness of the murder victims but not over much. The writing is still excellent and holds your attention. Looking forward to the new season and more cases.
"I loved this season of Bones even more than season one, as more of the cast are developing to fuller characters, with new subplots to keep things tied together, and more really cool forensics.Dr Brennan (Emily Deschanel) continues to struggle with her desire to feel normal emotional connection, while her intellect keeps her from exactly getting there, and while the chemical tension with her partner simmers under the surface. Thrown into the mix are new moral dilemmas due to her developing knowledge of her birth family, and shades of gray start to infiltrate her world of black and white. Can one be a moral (justified) killer? Etc. Forgiveness and love are examined in rather unique waysBones is very good TV, that I can enjoy with both my wife and my teens.So if you have already watched season one, get season two (but really, watch one first for the character development that is quite good) and have a marathon fun weekend!"
"O Happy Day! As presented in widescreen, here's Season 2 of Bones. The great news is that there's no slack off at all from season one's most excellent run. Involving forensic conundrums and grim visions of death once again winningly meld with great drama, humor, pathos, and tenuous romance. Emily Deschanel as forensic anthropologst Dr. Temperance ""Bones"" Brennan and David Boreanaz as FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz) continue to dazzle as television's most electric investigative duo.Whereas Booth is the intuitive people person, Brennan is still mostly socially in the dark. She remains dispassionate and driven in her pursuit of her personal Holy Grail, the truth. As always, her ability for drawing accurate observations from ruined human remains proves invaluable in solving FBI cases. As ever, the perceptive Booth and her free spirited best friend Angela are her main conduits to understanding the, to her, bewildering labyrinth of emotions and social decorum. Deschanel is great at allowing the audience to glimpse the wounds just beneath Bones' supremely confident exterior. She and Boreanaz are magical, and their chemical synergy remains the overwhelming draw of this series.There's a barrage of big technical jargon used on each episode, but that doesn't keep me from being sofa-ed in rapt attention. This show is so clever that my attitude more or less echoes Booth's: ""Keep talking. I'll catch up."" The mysteries are compelling enough, but when thrown in with the engrossing human elements, it makes me want to tune in to the show that much more. The squints, while intimidatingly brainy and toiling away on a wavelength drastically foreign from that of average folks, are nevertheless engaging and very sympathetic characters. The supporting cast is remarkably good and quirky, bolstered by this season's newcomer Tamara Taylor and by occasional guest stints by Ryan O'Neal, Stephen Fry, and the wonderful Patricia Belcher (as no-nonsense attorney Caroline Julian). It must be noted that T.J. Thyne (Hodgins) and Michaela Conlin (Angela) share an endearing chemistry.Season 2 introduces a couple of curve balls, beginning with the arrival of Dr. Camille Saroyan (Taylor) as Brennan's new boss at the Jeffersonian Institute, with whom Bones instantly clashes. Then mix in some office romances (except the one we're hankering for). Offer up a serial killer or two. And, thru all the cases she works on, Bones still fixates on her mother's unsolved murder and her father's disappearance. On this, some light will be shed.My favorite episodes are ""The Truth in the Lye"" (Tub of goo!! So cool tub of goo!! To quote Bones: ""Even for me, this is disgusting.""), ""The Woman in the Sand"" (Booth goes ultimate fighting and, Omigawd, Bones in a sexy black cocktail dress!), ""Aliens in a Spaceship"" (Hodgins and Brennan are entombed in a car and must come up with makeshift ways to surviva as air runs out; raw-emotioned acting by Thyne and Deschanel), the nerve-wracking ""The Blonde in the Game"" and its equally harrowing follow-up ""The Man in the Cell"" features the return of clever serial killer Howard Epps from last season's ""A Man on Death Row"") and the season-ender ""Stargazer in the Puddle"" (Bones learns more about her mother).Special Features include optional episode commentaries on ""The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House"" (with Emily Deschanel) and on ""Stargazer in a Puddle."" Boreanaz doesn't commentate this time; perhaps, his effort last season was deemed too loopy. Disc 6 offers ""The Memories in the Season"" featurette; ""Visceral Effects: The Digital Illusions of Bones"" featurette; 8 minutes of deleted scenes with optional commentary by the Executive Producers; and the gag reel.By the way, the episode commentary on ""The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House"" reveals that an unaired 22nd episode will debut in the third season. Does that mean there'll be 23 episodes in season 3? One hopes (but doubts)."
"This second season is exploring new ways and avenues where bones are of course multiplying at leisure and for our best pleasure. Yet this second season is quite new in several aspects.First and foremost the season is widely open to personal matters and it explores the private, and at times not so private, relations between the members of the team, after the boss has been changed to a woman, which rebalances the sexual ratios. Bones herself is courting and going out with an FBI agent who has temporarily replaced Booth while he was sort of suspended and deprived of a gun after shooting a clown on top of an ice-cream vendor's van. But in the end she will not go through the process completely as far as leaving the Jeffersonian for a life of full leisure and farniente.Zack manages to get his doctorate and to be hired in the job he was holding as an intern because he goes to Angela and begs for help on his  look and manages to become presentable, which means he can now stand in court and testify seriously in a deportment that can carry the agreement of the jury. So far he is no longer obsessed by sexuality but he encounters a great difficulty: he is summoned by the White House to go to Iraq. But this time this reference does not lead to any political dissertation or even cogitation on the subject. Political questions are systematically and carefully avoided in this second season.Jack and Angela are finally realizing they love each other and even decide to get married and they finally find themselves in front of a priest (in fact a black priestess) in some church for the last step when the State Department steps in and reveals Angela is already married in some kind of broom stick over-jumping ceremony. More later, I guess.Booth is entangled in the hands of a British shrink after his shooting the clown on the ice-cream vendor's van and he is a perfect sucker, building a full barbecue for the shrink under the shrink's blackmailing procedure of retaining the document he must sign. This same shrink will also step into Bones' psyche as some kind of private counselor. Agent Booth and Doctor Brennan will not be able to establish some kind of personal relationship, especially since Temperance's father reappears in her life and even saves the situation a couple of times. But he has to be arrested by Booth and be brought to court for his ancient crimes, including the attack against the deputy chief of the FBI, though this one was crooked to the utmost, his lips kissing the heels of his shoes or something like that.Booth reestablishes for a short while a relationship with the new boss of the institute, Dr Camille Saroyan, with whom he had had a liaison some time ago in another life. But that cannot last more than one or two episodes. This is characteristic of all these people: they are unable psychologically or administratively to build balanced and normal relationships. Is it a side effect of their jobs or professions, we can wonder, or simply  personal immaturity?That level of the season blurs out the various crimes and cases they examine and solve. And these cases do not deal with political issues or even with immigration, except one case about some strange Chinese practice of burying the bones of a man with the bones of a woman so that the man has some company on the other side of the road. Most cases are plain simple crimes in America and among Americans. But they often deals with social problems like the mother of a severely handicapped girl: what can the mother do to help her child the genetic victim of a deadly disease that keeps her retarded, even if it is only for a short time before she dies? Some of these questions are crucial: do we have the right to experiment on human beings new treatments that would enable astronauts to reinforce their bones that get highly decalcified due to prolonged sojourn in space?Some of the cases are plain vicious crimes and it is fun to catch the killers who are most of the time not at all the one or the ones we were expecting. Suspense is always with us even if the personal and more sentimental level of this season makes that suspense not as intense as I would personally prefer it to be.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID"
These are the kind of replays that are always entertaining for the whole family. Enjoyable and good to relax in front of.
"I tried the book series but couldn't get into it-both before the tv Bones began and after watching it-they are so different. The series is a wonderful mix of science, friendship,  sexual tension between the two leads and ""who did it""- the murder that is, that I am getting each season til I have them all. Watch the show on FOX and get hooked as I did."
Again I really Love this show and the people are great the story keeps you wanting for more each week...
"Whiel the first season of Bones was slightly imperfect, partly due to the real geekiness of its actors, it was a pleasure to watch. Fortunately with Season two the craetors have managed to make this an even better series. Boreanaz' stigma of having played Angel in the Buffy franchise is now completely gone and we can identify him with agent Booth completely. Bones social ineptitude is also put more on clear display this time. These are the two main things that mange to make the chemistry between them even stronger than last season."
Bones are the best series if you like crime and love story then these are the best series for you
"I loved Kathy Reichs' books centering on the Temperence Brennen character and read them all.  The show is somewhat different from the books but still very pleasing.  Reichs continues act as an executive producer/consultant and it shows in the forensic goodies.  Emily Deschanell is perfectly cast for her role as the tile character, and David Boreanz as well as her FBI cohort.  Plenty of humor to offset the gruesome details of the murders they investigate.  If you like crime procedurals, you won't be disappointed in this show.  There is also some nice romantic interplay among the various cast members as well.  A very attractive cast.  The shows are consistently enjoyable."
"I really enjoyed this TV series, and I found it superior to season one.In season two, the relationship between Dr. Brennan and Booth is well developed, albeit unpredictable, especially with the newly introduced and sexy new boss. There are a lot of tensions, thrills, passions, conspiracies, and sex in this season. Some episodes were extremely well though-off and intriguing. I did like the most the episode on the astronaut. Are there aliens from outer space, and did one just fall down to Earth? Watch the episode to find out.This series will teach you a lot of medical terms as well as how crimes are committed (and how not to commit crimes)."
"...Season 2 is where Bones hits its stride.  S1 was a fanatastic season, and what hooked most of us who have continued to watch this series, which is, by the way, currently one of the most well-written, character-driven, comprehensive shows on network television.And it is the well written episodes (that frequently tie-in to the past season and also allude to the future) and the absolutely outstanding and superior characters that make this show pretty damn flawless.  From ""Bones"" herself, to the self-depricating and sometimes hilarious Agent Booth (if nothing else this show showed how much range ""Angel"" DIDNT give David Borneaz, which is not something I thought I'd ever write) to the supportive cast (like Jack and Zach, you find out more and more about them practically each episode) to the sometimes-present tertiary cast members (for my money, there is NOT a more appealing character on the show than federal prosecuting attorney Caroline Julian, who says things so nuanced and powerfully, you just want to hear her read the phone book) this show will make you a unshakeable believer by this second season.Its not perfect.  Some of the dialogue is a little too Lifetime for me, on occasion, but this is the exception, not the rule, and being so well rounded is probably why both my wife and myself can fully agree on this show as one of our favorites.If you aren't watching Bones, you are missing out on possibly the best prime-time show on TV."
"This show got even better in its second season, with the arrival of the tough new Cam as the boss of the squints, the wonderful Stephen Fry appearing as Booth's psychiatrist, Angela and Hodgins falling in love, and wonderboy Zach being promoted and getting a new haircut in the process.  The characters and the show are really coming into their own now.  I look forward to season 3."
The interaction between Bones and Booth got even better this season.  The change in other characters helped develop the series.
"Most British comedy always gives me a laugh or twenty, but one in which pretentiousness is skewered is especially enjoyable."
"I continue to find a visit with keeping up appearances a delight.  Every one of these people are true professionals.  None of us would want a neightbor with hyacinth, but we love to watch others deal with her."
"Love this series and watch it over and over.  I am sure many people who watch it know a person like Hyacinth, which makes it even more humorous.  I am so happy I can watch it any time I want a good laugh with my Premium membership."
"This is one of my favorite comfort series and is great for a good cheer up.  Hyacinth's life revolves around appearing &#34;better&#34; than her station would really allow and is hilarious.  Having someone of high quality nod at her in her mind makes her best friends that she can brag about.  Patricia Routledge is excellent in her role as are the actors her play her husband, friends and family.  If you haven't seen this show, you need to.  You won't be disappointed!"
"When life is busy or frustrating, I turn on Hyacinth and relieve stress.  Good laughs are helpful and she provides so many.  Feel sorry for Elizabeth, but she's an angel and we think Richard is wonderfully written and acted, poor guy.  Very entertaining."
I enjoy British comedies. The language makes me think and stay focused.This comedy has always gotten laughs from me.
"I found this show by accident and fine it hilarious. I love Hyacith, Richard and the rest of the family.  A well written and acted show .  I miss some of the dialog due to the accent but the more I watch the better I understand.  A very funny sitcom."
"If you enjoyed Season 1 of Hyacinth and her attempts to impress all her friends and acquaintances, then you will also enjoy Season 2.  Brother- in-law Onslow and sisters Daisy and Rose keep popping up just in time to overturn Hyacinth and Richard's dinner party plans or a visit to a nobleman' s estate. Neighbors, the milkman, and and the postman also try their best to avoid Hyacinth, but can't quite seem to sneak by her house without running into her and getting a lecture on having cleaner shoes, better milk bottles, finding lost mail, etc. Of course, having her 90 year old ""Daddy"" thinking he needs to protect the area from imaginary bomb attacks doesn't help Hyacinth in her quest to be the best hostess either. Enjoy another fun filled season!"
"English humor can be a little hard to understand sometimes, but funny enough to keep me laughing & watching repeatedly until I began to get it"
"Clean, funny and plain right down silly.  Great acting and fun to watch.  I would recommend this to a friend."
"This is one of the more campy and fun SciFi shows to come from the BBC. It has some of the same arch sense of humor that makes the Dr. Who series so beguiling, but with a slightly darker and more dangerous edge."
"unfortunatley, I seem to be watching the seasons out of order (i can get several seasons on amazon, other ones from different places) - but the season is great - good twists & change-ups - now just get amazon to make all the seasons available..."
Wow the season with Ozzie.  Watching him swim and do so many of the challenges was fun.  Definitely one of the good seasons!
If you love survivor then you will want to checkout this season. This is one of the better seasons.Love it.
"No spoilers.I LOVED this season. The division in the tribes was incredibly entertaining and I loved seeing the drama that played out because of it. There's several big name players that come from this season and for good reason - they're amazing Survivors and a lot of fun to watch.If you're looking to spend money on a season of Survivor, it doesn't get much better than this. I highly recommend."
"I'm loving the ability to go back and watch the seasons of Survivor I missed! I was especially looking foward to this season because one of the castaways is from the same small town as I am. Please Amazon, get more older seasons soon!"
This is another great show with scenery that is not to be missed.  The challenges and rewards allowed the contestants to enjoy the native island culture.
Wonderful. Need all seasons available to buy.
"Yul is a great Survivor and is the mastermind of the entire season and deserves to win. Jeff Probst declares he was disappointed that Ozzy didn't win because of how well he dominated all the challenges. Ozzy is one of the best players to ever play the game and his game is pure according to Yul. He doesn't screw anyone in his alliance over and physically is a step above anyone else in the game. Yul is much smarter than Ozzy and gets more respect from the other players. Jonathan Penner is pretty funny and owns Probst in some of the back and forth at challenges. In the start of the game the tribes are divided by ethnicities into 4 tribes, which has never happened in Survivor. After the Asians dominate the first 2 challenges the tribes are mixed up. The hidden immunity idol plays a big role in this season. It's pretty cheap that you get to play it after the votes are read, so the person with the idol never gets any votes. This is a great season of Survivor, you should buy it."
"if for no other reason, select this season and admire oscar in all his glory! this man's smile will break hearts around the world..."
"Horatio and his crew just keep on doing what they do best, convict the folks that think its easy to get away with killing folks.  They do it with style, class, determination and sometimes a sense of humor as well.  Really loved the season 5 opening episode in Brazil that was really cool to see them go there and take down a criminal that thought he was getting away with killing someone dear to Horatio.  Very solid season 5 throughout with various crimes and different drama that affected everyone at the CSI office from gambling to ex's that just won't go away.  It has something for everyone especialy loved the special features with Wolf (Ryan Togo) showing us the ends and outs of the real CSI Miami office and what goes on there very cool.Looking forward to season 6 with the way this one ended, i know it come out in typical CSI Miami fashion with a bang."
"Loved the characters, their interactions, the crimes and how they were solved.  Love to see this show renewed.  Great fun, entertaining, and educational (for those of us who know nothing about catching the criminal)."
"The first couple of episodes weren't the best but overall, it is a good series. It kinda looks like they are just putting something together to have a show on a couple of the episodes. That is my only negative. A couple of the old case files came back into the picture and the bad guy comes to justice. I love it when they do that!Another good season for Miami:CSI!"
"This is another great police show,it also gets better each season and you also learn more background each season.Some of the eposides get emotional at the end  of them this season."
"To me, season four is the last of the great NCIS seasons, until season Nine. Gibbs is in Mexico, Ziva is on the run after being framed by a former massad officer who everybody thought was dead. Tony is the team leader, and Mcgee is no longer the probie. Ziva calls Gibbs in mexico, and he agrees to come back to the states to help. The F.B.I gets involved. But in the end, Ziva proves that she's an Investigator first now, and gets the killer to talk. Which clears her, and allows Gibbs to go back to Mexico. But not for long, as Fornell asks Gibbs's help in solving a case, which he does. And decides to come back to NCIS for good, the stories in season four are outstanding. The Halloween story alone is worth watching, as a marine is attacked in his home. And his daughter is kidnapped, and all throughout the case, Ziva thinks that the Daughter's mother is the one who kidnapped her own daughter. But alas, in the end she is wrong.  Or the creepy episode, ""Smoked"". Where a body is found in a chimney, the body of a sadistic serial killer with a toe in his stomach, only come to find out his wife was the actual killer. As she buried the bodies in their yard, and the episode ends with Gibbs asking fornell how he thought the toe got in the guys stomach. There are two threads of stories throughout this season, one is Tony has a new girlfriend, and Gibbs has a Girlfriend Col. Hollis Mann. We also find out, that Mcgee is a fictional writer. We're introduced to Shariff, in two incredible episodes, where they stop the terrorist the first time, and Gibbs is almost killed the second time they meet. Also in this season, we eventually find out that Tony's girlfriend is his undercover assignment for Director Shepard. As she tries to get an international arms dealer  La Grenoulle, now Ducky had been mad at Gibbs for quitting, but eventually they become friends again. And Paula Cassidy and her team are killed in an explosion, in a really powerful episode, season four ends with Jeanne and Dinnozo getting in a limo, which is her father's, and there is La Grenoulle. Season four again, is the last of the great NCIS seasons."
"For some reason, we had never watched this show.  Once we saw it we fell in love with it and have now watched season 1 though season and are anxiously awaiting season 11."
"I hated Mark Harmen for years.  I saw him in 2 roles where he was a really bad dude, and so convincing I decided he must be a bad dude for realz.  When NCIS came along I said &#34;I'm not watching that A hole&#34;.  The everyone kept telling me how much fun it was and how I was missing it.  I got the first couple seasons on sale and decided to give it a shot.  All is forgiven Mark.  The show is smart, funny and fresh every time.  they do not go too far on gore or violence and they always look good, even in a prison camp which is not easy.  You can start with any season and still enjoy but I suggest begining at the begining."
Love NCIS - enjoyed Season 4.  Watching every episode of every season to date to have a better understanding of the characters.  This is an awesome show.
"Love this show and love having the DVD's to watch anytime I wish. I am looking forward to purchasing seasons 7, 8 and 9 (when available) to complete my collection. We purchased seasons 1-6 for Christmas :-)"
"as we all know Season 3 leaves us with Gibbs gone from his position as the head of the NCIS team.  He's out of the fold but comes back in a case by case basis for the first few episodes.  As Tony is in charge of the team since Gibbs has been gone and isn't really too keen on giving that position back.  Among them being Ziva gets framed for murder when a bombing takes place while she's out on the town.  It only takes another episode or two and Gibbs is back and running things.  All the actors/actresses come together to make this show what it is.  A throughly engaging, story driven and all around fun show to watch.It just clicks from episode to episode with various cases in need of solving and a couple that delve deeper into the inner workings of the Director.  As she has a history with one of the criminals that the team is trying to apprehed.  The fourth season of NCIS continues to roll on and bring us excellent stories.  I'm looking forward to checking out the next couple seasons on DVD very soon.  Keep the show going it is one of the better and more interesting shows out there."
My wife has become incurably hooked on this show and the eclectic cast of characters. It is entertaining to watch as a result of clever writing and convincingly portrayed characters.  The plots are extremely varied even though they all boil down to the same crime scene investigation theme. There are both ongoing story lines as well as satisfactory resolution of crimes in each episode. The person who dreamed up the character of Abbey deserves a gold star and the role is convincingly as well as entertainingly played.
"""NCIS: The Fourth Season"" will delight fans with the entertaining mixture of tight police procedural and humorous team interaction they have come to expect.  This season will bring something extra, what exective producer Don Bellisario terms ""a season of secrets.""The opening three episode story arc concerns the return of Senior Agent Gibbs from his hiatus in Mexico recovering from injuries, including partial amnesia, suffered at the end of Season Three.  Along the way, we will learn that Israeli Mossad Agent Ziva David and acting team leader Tony Dinozzo have secrets from Gibbs.  In the course of the season, we will learn of Abby's secret romance and McGee's secret hobby.  Most importantly, we will learn of Director Shepard's secret vendetta against the arms dealer named Le Grenouille, for which she is prepared to bend and beak rules, and which will place Gibbs' team at risk by season's end.""NCIS: The Fourth Season"" includes eight special features on the production of the show, of which the most entertaining may be a two-part roundtable with the cast.  The cast answers questions about the show put by viewers, and the viewers may come to appreciate just how well cast the show really is.  ""NCIS: The Fourth Season"" is very highly recommended to its fans."
"Great fun to enjoy again and again.  Enjoy the characters, especially Abby,Ziva, and Ducky."
"This is a season of on-going story linesGibbs could not be allowed to retire and the first couple of shows bring him back to active duty.This season has several strong individual episodes.Witch Hunt has the famous Abby as Marylyn Monroe at Halloween.The episodes Once a Hero, Driven, Dead Man Walking and Smoked are excellent stand-alone stories.Twisted Sister and Friends & Loves present a McGee in a new light and are major steps in this characters development.Their are a number of story lines, some major and some just fun, in this season.Special Agent Lee and Jimmy have several encounters in less than appropriate places lending some comic relief.The publication of McGee's first book has some team members upset with how their portrayal.The decision to retire creates problems for Gibbs; Tony became team leader and is involved in special projects for the director.  These are ongoing stories during the season as problems are ""resolved"".Tony falls in love.Director Sheppard establishes her authority and hate for an arms dealer known as ""La Grenouille"".The producers call this the ""season of secrets"" and season five the ""season of answers""."
"I don't have television, haven't for 11 years. When I learned CBS was allowing free viewing over the internet I checked it out and started watching episodes of CSI, CSI NY, CSI Miami, and NCIS. I found NCIS to be my favorite and this particular show Dead And Unburied is my favorite so far. I enjoy the light-heartedness of NCIS. So I decided to download this episode from Amazon Unbox.I really wish Amazon Unbox would allow me to burn shows I've purchased. As it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer. When Unbox expands this service to allow me to burn DVDs I will likely purchase many more shows this way. I like selecting individual shows."
I have ordered all the seasons of NCIS so far and have had no problems with any of the DVDs. All have come fast and when they said they would come.
another great season. My only complaint is how it ended. it was just over. It was like the writers just ran out of steam and left us hanging. The development of the characters in this season has been a great.
"If you  like comedy  and drama the show is for you.It is a spin-off of the jag series that was on a few years ago,and both shows show you how military law is enforced.It is so well written that the hour thier on passes on so quickly."
Great series and would recommend it to anyone over the age of 18 years  I gave it a five star rating
I am one of those people who chooses not to pay for cable so I buy the programs I enjoy and know that will enjoy watch many times.  This series is one of my favorites and I have just about all of the seasons.  I really like William Peterson so I am not sure I will buy any more once he leaves in season 8 or 9.  I find that when I watch them again I see something I missed the times before so it is well worth the money to be able to have control over what I watch and when I watch it.
"This particular season is excellent. I cant wait until season 8 lands on Amazon.CSI is far superior to the other CSI shows (New York & Miami). Season 7 ends with a bang and leaves you drooling for more, like every other season.Great series, great acting, great stories!!!"
Excellent!
"There are various things going on with the people this time around.  Whether its Gregg witnessing a gang beating and becoming a victim himself ""Fannysmackin"".  Katherine having a little too much to drink and winding up in a motel and wakes to wonder whether she's been assaulted or not.  It's a lot going on in other episodes as well with various issues.  It goes without saying that you won't be bored anything or character in Season 7 of CSI as they continue to up their game and keep finding more interesting cases to tackle and underlying stories between the office as a whole.After 7 seasons one would think that CSI would be slipping up or become complacent about its longevity.  But that is so not the case especially with Season 7.  Each episode has a little something different to it whether its ""Lab Rats"" where the other workers in the CSI office take a front seat to try and help Grissom solve the mystery behind the miniature killer.  This is an ongoing arc throughout this Season and it requires all the characters help in piecing together exactly who's doing this and better yet why.""Living Doll"", it ends with a cliffhanger as Sarah has been kidnapped by the miniature killer leaving things wide open on what will actually happen to her will Grissom, Katherine and the others make it to her in time.Some of my favorite episodes from this include:""Built to Kill, Part 1""""Fannysmackin""""Living Legend""""Lab Rats""""Living Doll"" the season ender with a big cliffhangerThe whole season is worth purchasing in any respect as in also includes Special Features-""Inside Built to Kill"", ""Miniature Murders"", ""Who Are You? Inside Living Legend"", ""Las Vegas: The Real Crime Solvers"", ""The Evolution of CSI: Season 7"" and ""Smoke and Mirrors: Directing Feature Television.Excellent in all respects from the writers, storyline, actors/actresses, guest stars, lighting, various backgrounds and mainly the attention to detail.  That everyone involved puts into this show on a daily basis, i'm impressed.5 out of 5 stars"
C.S.I. Crime Scene Investigation - The Complete Seventh Season DvdQuick Delivery! New Condition. Excellent series.HIghly recommend Amazon!!
"Am enjoying the entire series - once you get into the characters, you just want more.  Came to me quickly and in great shape."
"This, by the way, is the second review I've written for this - don't know where the first one is.  Having said that ...Each season I keep saying the same thing, - this show keeps getting better and better. I feel this show always manages to stay fresh and interesting and I love it more and more with each new season. I can't wait for this release.The first episode in this season is Built To Kill where we are waiting to see more of what we found out in the last episode of season 6 - that Grisolm and Sara had gotten together. My favourite episode is Happenstance where identical twins have been seperately killed and the team try to work out whether the case is related or not. If you want a total recap of each episode then here it goes:Built To Kill 1 - Foul play is suspected when an apparent suicide victim still has the gun in his hand, and a flower delivery woman is found crushed to death in the middle of a Cirque du Soleil performance. (Look for a special appearance from John Mayer.Built To Kill 2 - Grisolm investigates the murder of a rock star, which is complicated by the discovery of a miniature replica of the crime scene at the house. And Catherine tries to determine if she was raped after waking up nude in a seedy hotel.Toe Tags - A group of dead bodies in the Las Vegas morgue get to know each other while CSI tries to solve the crimes that got them there.Fannysmackin' - (another favourite of mine) A gang of street thugs is beating and killing people all over the city.

At first the team aren't sure if they heard right or not, but it becomes apparent that they are a couple and that's almost as exciting as working out who's behind these miniatures.If you are a CSI fan, you are bound to love season 7. It truly gets better always and I already can't wait for season 8."
"As many people said this show kept getting better each year.The crimes are interesting and the cast is believable and solid.The introduction of the new Character Keppler was a great move although his sudden demise due to a corrupt cop is this seasons one strained aspect. After all if the corrupt cop was going to kill his partner he would be unlikely to do it in Vegas when he's from Trenton. However that's not implausible and he was after all blackmailing Keppler. So  people do things all the time that don't make any sense even bad cops. So even a strained episode of ""CSI"" is still top rate entertainment.Overall the series was at it's peak during this season and the next.The ninth season is excellent too but long time viewers are without three of their favorite characters.  As many posters pointed out this is one of the entire series best seasons and that's true enough because it remains a fascinating show and thankfully there's no techno soundtrack like on later episodes of ""CSI New York"". (which is a great show otherwise).  And that's just another reason to enjoy this wonderful show."
"If you like to watch police t.v. shows  this series is great for learning about police investigations. This is also the season were the team is  played with by the minature killer  that leaves a model of the same  crime scene  the CSI team is investigating,and you also learn more about the series characters."
"The seventh season of the smash hit, original C.S.I. found the show still going strong, as opposed to when many network hits fizzle out by this time in their life.  The season opens with Grissom (William Petersen) and Sara (Jorja Fox) keeping their relationship secret as a mystery unfolds regarding a killer who leaves behind exact, incredibly detailed, miniature replicas of the crime scene.  As the rest of the season unfolds, Greg (Eric Szmanda) finds himself in a predicament he never foresaw, Catherine (Marg Helgenberger) finds herself playing the role of victim, and when Grissom goes out of town, a shady transfered cop named Keppler (the excellent Liev Schreiber) arrives on the scene; culminating in one of the best storyarcs the series has ever seen.  As the season winds to a close, the CSI's close in on the miniature killer, and the season concludes with one of their lives in jeopardy, and the others desperate to make things right.  Undoubtedly one of the best seasons of the show in it's entire run, the original (and best) C.S.I. remains one of the best crime dramas to ever grace prime time network TV, and the seventh season is a prime example why."
This CSI Season is another great one!  Stories are always interesting and enjoyable. Peterson is one of my favorites. Would highly recommend!
"I have all the seasons currently available on DVDs - watching the 3d season right now and it never dissapoints. I am not even pretending I could understand most of its mathematics, but the ""adaptation"" is done with real elegance so that your average non-mathematician is often nicely tickled by understanding so much :) The series also keep a careful and well balanced proportion between brain part and emotions part, so the relationships and friendships are interesting to watch but they do not drag a clever and fascinating crime series into a family drama.One of the best crime/investigation series around, together with Criminal Minds, Without a Trace and CSI. Hope it stays around for many more seasons."
"I am a big fan of this series, each new season brings something new to the back stories of each character. I highly recommend."
"I enjoy this series, especially the interaction of the two brothers and their father. I recognize it is not especially realistic, but it is nonetheless, thought provoking and enjoyable."
"who thought that a show about mathematics and crime solving would be both interesting and engaging to watch at the same time.  Season 3 is chock full of engaging characters, situations and stories that will keep any and all interested in this ever growing and popular TV show.  Numb3rs is on the way up and Season 3 has more than enough intrigue, mystery, romance and quite a bit of betrayal in it (The Janus List) a lot of things get brought out into the open and one surprise that i didnt ever see coming at all.Enjoy this one because from the looks of it Rob Morrow, David Krumholtz, Judd Hirsch and the rest of the gang are in for heck of a ride in Season 4."
"With every episode it seems to get better, the story lines are excellent and the characters are great. I love the family dynamic that is shown in each of the stories told."
"My son is a statics masters student going onto his PHD, this show so reminds me of him and the math that he does, it just makes you realize that math is everywhere no matter where we are, sorry to see that the series ended so soon"
"We have enjoyed all of the episodes, like the characters, content is educational, love Professor Epps! Recommend to all viewers."
"I loved it. Good action, great characters and educational if you are into math and equations. I would watch it again too."
"An excellent program if you enjoy math and science. If not, the characters are fun to follow through the ups and downs of work and college life. You have to love Finehart(?)."
"Again, it's all about the numbers! Numbers bring in the bad guys! Brother duo are still offering up great sleuthing situations using FBI technics with plenty of math formulas. This season add more story with some sad news and some funny surprises."
Great series and enjoyable to watch.I like how math is used to help solve the different cases.The characters are really down to earth and this series showed life outside the F.B.I.office. Mike
"We watched this show every weeek when it was on.  Well, may have missed a few.  The shows are memorable and we mostly recall them very well and enjoy them as much as the first time.  Some things just wear well and this show has something."
The storylines in this season are awesome!**SPOILER**My favorite part of this season is Charlie and Amita finally get together officially.
"I give this five stars because not only is this series funny, but it is insightful into the nature of governments and bureaucracies.  While this show is poking fun at the British government, it would be easy to envision something quite similar in Washington."
My favorite characters are Sir Humphrey and the Minister.  Sir Humphrey can twist a simple sentence or command of the Minister in such a way that you cannot remember the question at all.  He is a riot.
"great series, the casting and acting is terrific.  the &#34;yes, prime minister&#34; series is also excellent.  anyone who enjoys political satire will like these shows."
Rarely do I give a rating like this to anything but British comedy is a weakness of mine and the actors in this series was always first rate.
"I usually watch a more serious program, but end the night with one episode of this program. The humor puts me in the right frame of mind for a good night's sleep.Anyone who likes BBC comedy will thoroughly enjoy this program."
"&#34;Yes Minister&#34; and &#34;Yes Prime Minister&#34; are excellent BBC programs. Intelligent, entertaining, enlightening, witty, and fun. The one-breath convoluted statement that bureaucrat Humphrey delivers in each episode is delicious."

"This was my intoroduction to sci-fi when I was in 2nd grade.  Certain episodes were so vivid that they etched themselves permanently in my memory.  Upon watching them again, I see how they are also emotionally appealing and surprisingly sophisticated, both in their science and in the lack of ""feel good"" deus ex machina endings that mar so many otherwise excellent Star Trek stories.I think by far the best story of this lot is ""The Man Who was Never Born"", which exudes a kind of timeless anguish.  It still moves me to think of the deformed Landau, who was truly brilliant.  But the ""Architects of Fear"" is also wonderful, with the good man sacrificing himself in vain and communicating his love to his wife from his horribly altered form.  They are both tragedies with grand conceptions behind them, truly unique. ""The Galaxy Being"" and ""The Sixth Finger"" are also deeply affecting and believable in their way.  These are all timeless themes in hard sci-fi, done extremely well.There are some bad episodes too, but overall the good ones are worth the price of admission.  I do not see why some reviewers are angry at the format of splitting season 1 into 2 volumes - it doesn't cost more.Warmly recommended as a piece of TV history that still stands on its own as outstanding hard scifi."
I bought this episde of the Outer Limits purely from never forgetting watching it back in the 60's.  It was one of my favorites then and still is.

"I never would have thought I would enjoy a show like this. WOW...what a show. Honestly, I could do without the foul language and the nudity and in most cases such would cause me to go elsewhere. But this show is one of the BEST crime drama's I've ever seen. The main character, Dexter Morgan, is one of the BEST lead characters ever. The supporting cast of characters (everyone from his sister to girlfriend(s) to the many police officers) are all excellent as well. But wow...the story is soo good! It just pulls you in and keeps you wanting more."
"Michael C Hall, hot off the HBO series Six Feet Under, plays the title character Dexter Morgan in this series from Showrime Entertainment. A crime scene investigator from Miami who is an expert on blood. He also likes to seeking revenge on those criminals who escape the law by loopholes in the justice system. Believe me this is no CSI show!Created by novelist Jeff Lindsay, Hall and his supporting cast (including Lauren Velez, James Remar, Julie Benz, and Jennifer Carpenter)create an interesting portrait of man whose blood is dipped in both worlds. Hall's baby face showcases an evil side underneath his devilish killer smile. The show is an interesting character study as well as a great murder mystery.There is the  Ice Cream truck murderer who is stalking Dexter and leaving killer clues. The mystery unfolds in these 12 episodes and you will be intrigued by the last episode. This is like a good British televsion series, a full complete story unfolded in 12 parts.The extras on the fourth disk are  two episodes of Showtime's The Blotherhood (which is also available on DVD), audio commentary on the 12th episodes, and a true life crime story. Those of you with computer can read the first two chapters of the latest Dexter novel and a download of the Showtime show the Tutors (soon to be on DVD)Even without the extras, this is a five star killer show...its a bloody good time. This , like House, is what great TV is all about!  I can not wait until October for season twoBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
"I just finished watching Dexter : Season 1 and it is phenomenal!I'm an avid movie watcher and TV series watcher! Ive watched all the seasons of CSI Vegas and Law & Order SUV, The Shield!Dexter is far superior to all of them. Season one starts out good, gets alot better half way through as the characters develop and ends with an amazing season finale!Showtime hit a homerun with this one! Im looking forward to Season 2 and have already lent my Season 1 set to a friend!"
Loved it. I have always wondered what was the hype around this show. Now I know. This show is amazing.
"I will admit to some hesitation at even wanting to watch this show.I sit in Dialysis 2.5 hours a day 5 days a week. Sitting in Dialysis is hard, the recliner chairs are most uncomfortable having two 15 gage needles stuck in your arm is at best painful. Nor having anyone to talk to is the pits.what i did is bought (what was at the time) the only portable blu ray player on the market and started watching blu ray movies.i was told about Dexter by friends and everyone that told me about it loved t. ""it's about a cop that kills on the side"" they would tell me. after a few of them talked me sensless about it i thought i would try it.I loved it from the first show.Set in Miami, Dexter works for the police department figuring out how blood splatters from the victems of knife or gun shot wounds. but he has a darker side. he himself is a killer. his step father taught him how to channel his instincts and kill thoughs that are ""unworthy to live"".It;s dark, often funny, and very bloody. this is not recomended for those that can' stand people screaming and bleeding a lot. but it is for those that have a dark sense of humor"
"This set has been reviewed extensively so I won't get into too much detail except for why I gave it 5 stars. There are a lot of repetitive shows out there, about 100 regarding vampires, another hundred crime or law shows, etc. Yes, this is a crime show but they put a spin on it like no other. A serial killer who kills serial killers, rapists, murderers, etc? Awesome. The narration is actually amusing. The storytelling is amazing. I love it. It gets my 5 star vote."
"or those that can't stand the sight of blood because it is in abundance in this show.  Along with Dexter (a guy with more skeletons in his closet than a graveyard) and his repressed memories of a violent tragic indicent early in his life.  As the season builds we get to see glimpses of it with more and more being revealed until.  It builds up with a face to face confrontation with the Ice Truck Killer (a few surprises) abound in the first season finale and it leaves things wide open.  For the series and all of its characters.I believe that Season 2 will continue to impress and draw in new folks in the process.  Excellent story, lead and supporting characters and backgrounds leaves you with the first season of Dexter.  An up and coming show that gives those established shows a serious run for their money."
"Dexter Morgan is good at his day job, that of a blood spatter analyst in Miami PD's forensics unit. But he's bloody brilliant at his other job, the one where he gets to murder. Whatever effed up sitch it was that caused Dexter's amnesia regarding his early childhood, it's left him dead inside, an empty shell, a calculating cold fish. He co-exists with something he calls a ""Dark Passenger,"" essentially this urge that compels him to kill and kill. Recognizing the predatory beast inside Dex, his ex-cop foster father, Harry (James Remar), took the boy under his wing, reoriented his twisted appetites to a more productive cause. He instilled in Dex an elaborate code of ethics, taught him to target only other serial killers. He taught Dexter how not to get caught, how to blend in. Dads are awesome. And Dexter has steadfastly abided by the Code of Harry. His kills have been righteous kills.This Showtime adaptation is based on Jeff Lindsay's riveting series of books, and if you haven't read them, well, what's the hold up? Dexter Morgan is so emotionally detached he makes Dr. Temperance Brennan seem positively warm and cuddly. Social cues to which we effortlessly respond are baffling puzzles for him. Perversely, there is something innately likable about Dexter. Michael C. Hall plays him with stunning complexity. It helps that, like in BURN NOTICE, we're privy to his inner musings. Dexter is often humorous and whimsical. The girlfriend (Julie Benz) he pretends to care for doesn't suspect a thing. Even Dexter's jittery, potty-mouthed cop sister, Deb (Jennifer Carpenter), doesn't have an inkling.DEXTER THE FIRST SEASON hooks you in straight away as Dexter finds his bragging rights as Miami's resident monster challenged by an innovative fellow serial killer whom the press eventually dubs the Ice Truck Killer. It's an edgy cat-and-mouse game that would span the entire season and cause Dexter to ask serious questions of himself. The lovely twist is that Dexter accepts the Ice Truck Killer's tauntings with glee, perhaps like calling to like. For Dexter, it's an opportunity to play with someone just like him. Never mind that it's readily apparent that this rival knows everything about Dexter Morgan. Dexter shrugs this off. He's having fun.The Ice Truck Killer's modus operandi is eye-catching. He drains his victims completely of their blood and he freezes the corpses, amputates their limbs to a precise measurement. It's fun - and creepy - watching Dexter try to contain his excitement as each perfect frozen body part surfaces, each bit a gauntlet thrown in Dexter's mug.Most each episode also features a ""serial killer of the week"" motif, some heinous repeat murderer targeted and eventually carved up by Dexter, and these lesser villains are required so that we don't lose faith in Dex as a badasss dude, given his inability to track down the elusive Ice Truck Killer. It's a pretty good supporting cast, too. It wasn't long before I was keen into what these other characters were up to. Jennifer Carpenter is my second favorite actor on this show. She is one sexy, combustible, never-stop-cussing cop chick. But I do question her instincts. She's Miami PD - an ex-Vice, newly minted Homicide Detective - and yet in all these years she hasn't caught a whiff of her adopted brother's true nature? And then she does something else which ends up absolutely mortifying. And then there's Erik King whose angry, loose cannon character, Sgt. Doakes, is the only one who gets the heebie jeebies from Dexter. Doakes bullies Dexter so much, I sort of wish Dexter would just disregard the Code of Harry for once. Except that Dexter remains as cool as the other side of the pillow. He's a monster who's got his priorities straight. You need to not miss this show. It's wicked funny, cleverly written, and terrifically acted (especially by Michael C. Hall). Rife with moral ambivalence, DEXTER rewards its audience with unexpected - and frequently unsettling - moments. And you're hooked before you know it.The DVD set's bonus features:- 2 Audio Commentaries by the Cast & Producers: ""Return to Sender"" (with Jennifer Carpenter, David Zayas, Lauren Velez, and Erik King) and ""Born Free"" (with producers Sara Coleton, Clyde Philips, & Daniel Cerone)- ""The Academy of Blood - A Killer Course""- ""Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation"" - feature on a real-life police investigation in 2001 with particulars on blood spatter analysis- 2 Free Episodes of Showtime's Hit series BROTHERHOOD- A computer-compatible function which allows you to stream two episodes of THE TUDORS, to read the First 2 Chapters of Jeff Lindsay's newest novel DEXTER IN THE DARK, and play the newest CSI Video Game ""CSI: HARD EVIDENCE""- Cast Biographies"
"Had a friend who loaned me season 1,and after watching it I ordered seasons 2-4.This show has plenty of drama,to many twist's and turns to figure out what's next. Lot's of humor (you can't help but like Dexter's one liners!)Just waiting for season 5 to come available!"
"This concerns only the first season of this series and I know some of the things will not seem right to those who have watched the next seasons. But that is just the point. The first season has characteristics that will change later and the meaning will change too. I will keep within the very limits of that first season. What we gather from the first episodes is that this blood technician working for the Miami PD is the adopted son of a police officer. He was adopted at the age of four by this police officer because he had been traumatized by the killing of his mother with a chain saw by some drug dealers. At once the series insists on the fact that this trauma caused an irreversible damage in the psyche of the child who is fascinated by death and needs killing just like junkies need their drugs. He is addicted to inflicting death to other people. We will only learn quite late in this season who his real father was, after his death actually, so we will never know the man really. We will not be given in this season any detail about the death of the mother beyond what I have said. And all the detail that comes up now and then is always flashbacks in the memory of the child that Dexter was. Dexter recovers that memory little by little just like any child or even adult would do in the case of a traumatic event. His foster father just tried to bring this death impulse of his within some acceptable limits, within a certain code: you can kill but to survive hence you have to kill people who are just plain dirty (I sort of remember this is the code of Anne Rice's vampires). And that's what he has been taught and trained to do. First hide your impulse. Second pick the proper criminals. Third do it so professionally that you can never be suspected. This ideology then is very typical. You can survive any trauma if you know what you are, if you accept what you are and if you find out why you are what your are. When you finally know, then you are clear. The term comes from Hubbard but it is the one that is needed here. It may change later. This concept of clarity is doubled then with the Skinnerian concept of absolute determination of your whole being and future by the mould into which you have been cast in the very first years of your life. In this case, Dexter is a killer because of his trauma that happened when he was four, hence he will be a killer all his life. No one can change that. One can only teach the kid a code, a method, an art to do things along a certain ethical line and not to be caught. That is pessimistic but that is not the main interest of this first season. The main interest is that another serial killer, the Ice Truck Killer, though not being a copy cat, is obviously aiming at this Dexter. And his crimes that are very special in their style, method and delivery are there to titillate Dexter, to chase or bait Dexter into a trap or a corner. Little by little we will learn the connection between the two and that I won't reveal. In the end Dexter will have the upper hand and kill his competitor, along his own method, more or less.  The second interest of this series is how Dexter can keep his secret for himself in his own private life, hiding it from the women he is going along with, from his own sister (foster sister for sure but sister anyway), from his direct colleagues, from his department, etc. It is subtle and difficult and there the actor is doing quite a good job, though the series is more building the meaning with the environment of the character than with the acting of the actor. As usual in American series the actors are rather static and the stage director, the series director and the set designer are building around him or her a composed visual moving environment that builds the meaning of the expression or speech of the actor. Note in this case most of the discourse of the main actor is his own voice over the pictures. He is telling us a story and it is often a commentary of what we can see. The next and essential quality of this series is of course the real artistic and artful suspense that is built in each episode and in the twelve episodes of the season and that lets us absolutely breathless most of the time, even when we finally know who the Ice Truck Killer is, and then the suspense does not go down one iota. In other words this series is so far, first season only, Dionysian, quick, fast, dense, exhilarating, inebriating, intoxicating and many other things of that sort. In one word it is addictive and habit forming. You may, if you have ten hours and a half at your disposal watch the twelve episodes in one go and you will never be bored, tired, de-concentrated. Try it and you will like it I am sure.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID"
"This is the introduction season.  They want us to learn about the characters and take an interest in them.Dexter is a sociopath serial killer.  Adopted and raised by a police officer, Dexter learned to appear ""normal"".Training as a forensic specialist, coupled with his Father's training keeps his killings from official notice.Set in Miami, Dexter works for the police helping them solve cases.  Along the way, Dexter kills the bad people that have beaten the system.This season revolves around ""The Ice Truck Killer"" and how this affects Dexter.The humor is dark.  The dialog is witty and cutting.  The acting is above average, no one is miscast and all work well together.The story line is not overly complex.  If you think about it, you will see where the story is going.  Even with that, it is fun.If you find the idea of a serial killer working for the cops funny, you should enjoy this."
"Well, I have to say, when I heard about this show.....I detested the idea, thought it was gloryfiying serial killers....SWORE I would never watch......happened to be trapped working out and watching TV when a episode came on....I thought Meh....just get it over with....well I was hooked from the first scene....I couldn't hardly wait for the next weeks episode, so I decided to give in to my ""dark side""....lol...and buy the first and second season.  I REALLY like this show, it is slick, entertaining, innovative, well written and acted.....over all as stated in the title this is just a BRILLIANT show and I am really glad I was forced to give it a chance and not miss out on this stellar show!"
"I have read the entire series of Dexter novels and was pleasantly surprised to find out that Showtime has dramatized the series. Ye potential readers and viewers, be aware!! The Showtime series differs from the books in several ways. The ending of the first book and the first series are not the same. The TV version fleshes out the other characters, such as Rita. the girlfriend and the police lieutenant, La Guerta  and introduces a new character in the person of Esme. The book is an intense ride within Dexter's mind with a focus on his relationship with his Dark Passenger. The details of his relationships with other humans are not as detailed as in the series.Having said this, I highly recommend both. It will be interesting to see how Showtime adapts the second novel.I think Showtime has done a great job of casting in this series. I remember Michael Hall from ""Six Feet Under"" and I think he makes a perfect Dexter.Also, CBS is now showing Showtime's Dexter on Sunday evenings at 10 pm. It cuts too much from the Showtime series for my taste, but it is better than most of the junk on TV."
"This is absolutely one of the most original series around. No surprise there because Dexter first appeared in  book form (see link below). If someone had told me I would be riveted by a book written from the viewpoint of a serial killer, well...I would never believe it. But Dexter was almost...loveable and he has a certain morality, believe it or not.The series is different but I found it equally intriguing and quirky.Here's the real irony in this series: someone who is so far from having normal human traits, who really doesn't understand love or sexual attraction, can reveal insights into what it means to be human in a way that a more stereotypical series doesn't. It is similar to the way the dark parts of paintings illuminate the light, each complimenting the other. Dexter is dark but he isn't simplistic and he has a wry sense of humor.I was pleased that some of what had attracted me to the books managed to get on screen as well, including Dexter's unique humor and a certain presence that resonates from page to film. That pleased me. What is most amazing to me is how this series actually reverberated emotionally and touched my life in ways I never believed possible, considering the focus of the series.This could have been a flop. It was a brave move to put something like this on the air and I feared (before I saw the first episode) that the depth and complexity of Dexter, hiding beneath that slick, seemingly inhuman surface, would be lost. But my fears were groundless, thank goodnes.Dearly Devoted DexterDexter in the Dark: A NovelDarkly Dreaming Dexter"
"Always thought serial killers are scum but I kinda like having Dexter around just to even things out, balance the bad with the...whatever."
The acting the writing the concept.....it has great replayability as well for viewing a second time. It's like silance of the lambs/six feet under/CSI all rolled into one quality show.
"4.7 starsThis show is excellent mainly due to the tight bond Hall makes with this character. I'm not crazy about any of the acting here except Hall's, but he's flawless throughout, bringing a subtlety that few actors on the big or small screens ever master to this degree.Nearly every episode is well-written, paced, and directed; the season arc is a good one and plays out nicely, no need for spoilers here!It does get a little gory at times, but the series is about a serial killer, after all. I have some very queasy thoughts about why a series this twisted is so popular, but I guess it's just another Clint-type revenge drama where psychopathic violence is justified by (a vaguely) moral imperative; we do need our foreign policy to start somewhere.Hall is even better here than in Six Feet Under, where he was superb. He carries Dexter effortlessly on his shoulders, but one can feel the amount of work and care he's put into this role. It's as impressive as Gandolfini's Tony Soprano, and that's saying a lot. As is usual for most of the best cable dramas, the first season seems to be the best, so savor this one if watching it for the first time.Miami hasn't looked this good and this bad since Michael Mann was in town."
"I love Dexter, who knew being so bad could be so good. love the concept of the show, its something different for me to watch with all the detective shows out there. Would most surely recommend. The show is about a serial killer who only kills bad people and serial killers."
"The first few seasons really shine, Dexter is a fresh storyline, with suspenseful plots, and great acting.  This show stands head & shoulders above most of what else is out there."
"Dexter is the most amazing, clever, funny, dark and thrilling program I've almost ever seen.  It is brilliant and unique and interesting and thoroughly enjoyable.  The fact that we can actually like a serial killer is amazing in itself.Michael C Hall is fantastic as Dexter.  He is intelligent, lost, and almost unable to feel love for another human.  The story lines are chilling and keep you on the edge of your seat - you are always guessing.  The writing is superb and witty and smart.  I never read Jeff Lindsays books, but now I think I'll go buy them and read cover to cover.Trust me; this show is one that grabs you and won't let go till the ride is over.  Just when you think you have things figured out, they might take a different turn.  It's addictive and one of the best programs you'll ever see.  It's great and I love this."
"I loved Michael C. Hall in Six Feet Under so I was excited when he chose to do another cable TV show.  This show turned out to be even better than Six Feet Under.  Michael C. Hall plays a serial killer who kills only bad people.  This creates a moral ambiguity that the show plays up nicely.  Is Dexter a good or bad person?  How do we really feel about him?  How does he really feel about himself?  At the time we are exploring the story, Dexter is evolving from a character who states he lacks human feeling to someone who seems to feel more and more with each passing day (or episode).  The show is brilliantly done.  I've read the book and it is a pretty straight forward story.  To build the story up, the writers of the show build up the characters and made them even deeper characters.  I am just so impressed with the work.  They can even make me angry because I'm so involved and one of my major characters is affected in some way.  I am attracted to Dexter and repelled by him at the same time."
"Showtime's creative and terrific series of DEXTER is so fresh and uber-cool that we just have to applaud everyone who works on this awesome cable TV series.It is so rare to watch a television show that rivals or even feels like you are reading a rich novel. Usually they screw it up, whether it be Hollywood big screen adaptations of the Sci-Fi channel - they all usually suck eggs.But not Showtime! They are currently way better than HBO. With the richness of feel and look at the miami-based Dexter, the actors and writers here truly shine above most others of all arenas of television and/or Box Office standards.And the 2nd season thus far is just as good - if not better!"
"Television has been called a vast wasteland. I've heard people rant and rave for years about having so many channels and nothing to watch on TV. And then I started looking at two things. The first was my television watching schedule which has actually begun cutting into my DVD watching schedule (so little time, so much to watch). Then I looked at my shelving unit and noticed the number of TV series collections there. People are wrong. There is plenty good to watch on TV. And DEXTER is an example of it.For those who aren't aware, DEXTER is a series on Showtime, so many of you might not have seen it. If that's the case you're in luck because the series has been released on DVD. While season two has just hit shelves in blu-ray format, the focus here is season one.Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) is a forensics blood splatter expert for the Miami police department. His job is to help collect and understand evidence found at the scene of a crime that involves blood and blood splatter patterns. Oh, and on the side, Dexter is a serial killer.Stay with me here because he's not a bad guy really. Well...then again maybe he is. After all he is a murderer multiple times over. The difference is that Dexter only kills bad guys. Dexter kills murderers, pedophiles, arsonists and the like that got off due to some technicality. But he always verifies that they were guilty before taking them out of the picture.Dexter's foster father Harry (James Remar) was a police man who found Dexter at the scene of a crime before adopting him. Harry recognized the killing instinct found in Dexter at an early age so he helped him to channel that, to use rules that he established for Dexter, to get through life. And via Harry's rules, Dexter now kills bad guys using his job as a means to find just the right victims.So there is the basic set up for the series. But it's so much more than that, filled with layer upon layer of subtext and inner meaning that is revealed as the series progresses.Season one focuses first on letting us know who Dexter is and who the surrounding cast of characters involved with him are. First off is his sister Deb (Jennifer Carpenter), a seemingly spastic patrol officer dying to become a homicide detective. Deb's enthusiasm for the job is off set by her self deprecating ways and the giddiness she exhibits for all things.At the stations there are two main characters who affect Dexter. The first is Lt. Maria Laguerta (Lauren Velez) his direct supervisor who at times seems to have a personal interest in Dexter. A woman who's made it where she is by hard work, she has a storyline of her own involving police office politics as the series progresses.The second is Sgt. James Doakes (Eric King), Dexter's apparent nemesis. Doakes is a hard boiled cop from top to bottom, a no nonsense sort who wants answer and wants them now. Doakes is constantly badgering Dexter, offering everything from name calling to in your face attitude. One would think that eventually the two of them would reach a point where there wouldn't be room for both of them in Miami. One would think.Along with these major players there is an assortment of cast members in the squad who round out the ensemble in the best way possible. And each gets enough screen time in season one to make them a character to care about. The interaction between them on a personal level comes into play as the layers of Dexter unravel.On the personal side, Dexter actually has a girlfriend. Normal on the outside, but not within. It seems Dexter has taken her as his girlfriend to help appear normal. It is through his thoughts (voice over into Dexter's mind runs throughout the series) concerning her that he lets us know he is devoid of emotion, that he has no feelings. His involvement with her is purely as a means to offer him cover.Rita (Julie Bienz) is a battered wife, or at least she was. Dexter's sister was on call when her ex was arrested. Paul, her ex, was a wife beater extreme and a drug user to boot. Now in prison, he gets release part way into season one and a subplot here involving him trying to reinsert himself into his family's life crosses Dexter's life as well.With characters and plot lines established, you would expect the series to kick off with Dexter showing what he can do. Instead, Dexter finds himself in a competition of sorts when a new serial killer hits Miami. And this killer is leaving calling cards that Dexter not only finds discomforting but amazing as well. He's impressed with the style and artistic ability of the killer who leaves his victims in pieces and drained of blood.As each episode continues the tale, we find that this new killer referred to as the Ice Truck Killer (when it's discovered that he uses one to haul victims from their murder location to where he leaves their bodies) knows something about Dexter. He leaves small clues at first for Dexter to find. Eventually he leaves Polaroid's of Dexter's past as well. It seems that the perfect serial killer is being stalked by his own serial killer.Season one not only defines who the character of Dexter is it offers the world he lives in and tosses in his biggest match to boot. How Dexter became who he is and what influences him is told in flashback. His motivations are shown by the end of this season as is the identity of the Ice Truck Killer. But will that change who Dexter is? Doubtful since season four begins soon.What makes this show so unique is that it combines one of the most frightening characters one can imagine, a soul less who cares serial killer, with one of the wittiest funny line spouting people seen on TV. Dexter tosses off subtle one liners non-stop and each one offers a glimpse behind the mask and a laugh as well.But the amazing thing is that not only do we find ourselves repulsed and attracted to the same character, we find in the writing that there is more to him than is even he realizes. The character of Dexter may think he possesses no emotions whatsoever but his emotions run deeper than he realizes. And it seems as though his journey of self revelation may be what's driving the series forward in later seasons.Also Dexter offers something that many of us would never want to admit we seek. An avenging angel out there doing what so many would love to know is going on but at the same time turn their head and condemn on the outside. Like Jack Bauer of ""24"", a hero who uses tactics we claim to hate while hoping someone like him exists to protect us, Dexter is the privately admired solution for those who feel that the worst of criminals are let lose on technicalities. We would fear someone like Dexter while at the same time would love to see someone who doesn't let the bad guy get away with murder. Even though this is what Dexter does, murder.There is no way to offer up in this short space just what it is that Dexter is about. Police procedural. Police politics. Serial killer. Murder mystery. Family complexities. Killing tutorial. Hilarious dark comedy. All are a part of Dexter and all come together in a fantastic package.If you're not afraid to try something a little different, then you need to give Dexter a try. I know the season one set I watch belonged to my son. After watching I intend to get a copy of my own. And to continue with it down the line. I'm already hard at work watching season two on blu-ray to write about. Unusual, quirky, off beat, scary, normal...all are words that define Dexter. And yet none can explain what this series is all about. Watch and see."
Who knew a serial killer could be so charming?
"Once you watch one, it will be tough to stop watching them. Great mix of having a per episode mystery of sorts and having a season long build-up."
"Wow! I finally watched my very first episode of ""Dexter"" last weekend, and I ended up finishing Season 1 in its entirety within a few days. This is an amazing show about Dexter (Michael C. Hall), a Miami-based forensics experts who also happens to be a serial killer. However, Dexter is a NICE serial killer in that he has a strict moral code that he always adheres to: He only kills people who are violent criminals themselves and deserve to be punished. The first season of ""Dexter"" revolves around another serial killer that's been terrorizing the state of Florida. The Ice Truck Killer has a nasty habit of murdering prostitutes, cutting them up into pieces, and arranging their bodies artfully in very public places. Dexter works with members of the police department, including his adopted sister, Deb (Jennifer Carter), to find the killer. However, Dexter can't help being fascinated by the Ice Truck Killer's meticulous technique. He soon begins communicating with the killer, who seems to have an uncanny connection to Dexter and starts using his murders to trigger painful, repressed memories from Dexter's past.I became hooked on this show very quickly. Hall is amazing as Dexter, who is probably one of the most complex characters in television history. The supporting cast is excellent, especially Carter, Erik King as Sergeant Doakes (the only person who suspects Dexter of any wrongdoing), and James Remar, who portrays Dexter's father in flashbacks. I'm not particularly fond of Rita's character (portrayed by Julie Benz). She's incredibly wishy-washy, but I can definitely see why Dexter was drawn to someone with her personality. I also think the whole Ice Truck Killer identity revelation, intriguing as it was, could have been a bit less obvious. (I figured out his real identity and true connection to Dexter right away, so either the story was a bit too predictable or I am just incredibly brilliant.)Overall, though, ""Dexter"" is a very unique and compelling show. I have no idea how the program will manage to surpass its first season, but I can't wait to find out."
"I had never seen Dexter before not having showtime but after seeing the show on a regular station I was hooked and ordered the first season,loved it and am waiting for the second season which I ordered to ship. It's definitely addictive. The show is well written you actually like this serial killer"
"Sometimes I find connections to Hollywood in the strangest places.  In the case of Dexter, it was at my day job. Now my office job is not normally the place one associates with a show like Dexter, but it turns out that the sister of the guy I worked with worked on the show. The fact that the show is on Showtime and thus can portray gore and violence as appropriate to the medium (like HBO's Rome, for example) piqued my curiosity. Unfortunately, it took me over a year to actually view season one.  I'm sorry I waited so long.I've done enough research on serial killers (and their fictional cousin, slashers) to know that they're easy to mess up.  And an entire season about a serial killer from the serial killer's perspective is fraught with peril. Fortunately, Dexter hits all the right notes to keep an audience engaged for the entire season.Dexter Mogran (Michael C. Hall) is a serial killer with a cause.  His father, Harry (James Remar) recognized his adopted son's homicidal tendencies and trained him to stalk the most despicable of prey.  These were the lowest of the low, the scum that Harry in his job as a cop saw frequently escape justice.  Dexter became a Final Solution of sorts, eliminating people neatly and efficiently while at the same time fulfilling insatiable desire for bloodshed.  Literally.In his day job, Dexter is a blood spatter analyst.  He works side-by-side with his adopted sister, Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), probably the most annoying character in the show.  And yet, she's annoying on purpose - her frail, waif-like reactions to men and the rigors of her job make her alternately pathetic and vulnerable, feral and misguided.  In short, she needs Dexter's calm, creepy presence. Rounding out the cast is career-climbing Maria Laguerta (Lauren Velez), coworkers Angel Batista (David Zayas) and Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee, formerly of the show Chuck) and my favorite character, foul-mouthed Sergeant James Doakes (Erik King).  Doakes is the only person who sees Dexter for what he is, but he can't prove it.Dexter feigns a personal life as well.  He has a girlfriend, Rita Bennett (Julie Benz), whose last relationship was so emotionally scarring that she fears intimacy, which suits Dexter just fine.  Indeed, all of Dexter's life is an act, from the jokes he cracks to the donuts he brings to the pleasantries he exchanges with Rita.  He's a monster masquerading as a person, and the only reason it's not more obvious is because everyone else has more pressing problems.Dexter's job puts him in a unique position to both appreciate the art of the kill and find new victims. Despite his penchant for murdering his victims, Dexter's murders are relatively clean - he drains his victims of blood, hacks the pieces up, and tosses them into the ocean.  And so it goes: find some sleazeball who escaped justice, kidnap him or her, murder, dump the body, repeat. Until one day, another serial killer who seems to know intimate details about Dexter's past begins sending messages through his own unique style of doll-like murders.The ending of season one won't be a shock to observant viewers.  It's not the actual ending that matters but the journey getting there. Dexter's narration is amusing and wry, his cadence just off enough that he comes across as disturbed yet functional. Surprisingly, the show isn't very gory at all.  Dexter would probably be less sympathetic if we were subjected to every grisly detail.  In fact, by cutting away from the most gruesome scenes, Dexter has to remind us that he's one of the bad guys - the Code of Harry is as much the anti-hero's code that we see in a multitude of other crime-fighting shows.  It's a credit to the writers that Dexter is both a monstrous, damaged human being and yet still human.Can't wait for season two!"
"This is the leader of the pack in terms of Showtime's original series. This is the only show they have that I feel can compete with HBO. The acting and writing are amazing, especially Michael C. Hall (who got an Emmy and Screen Actors Guild nomination for this part).If you can handle the macabre, allow yourself to enter Dexter's world. You might find it hard to leave until the first season is over."
"Dexter has finally made his Blu-Ray debut, and the glossy, well-made series looks wonderful in the format.  Besides some relatively small BD-Live features (including seeing the first episode the third season), there really isn't anything here that wasn't on the standard-def version of the Complete First Season, but for Blu-Ray owners who haven't taken the plunge into Dexter's world, this is definitely worth checking out.  Below is my original review for first season.The interesting concept of this Showtime series makes it reason enough to check it out.  Michael C. Hall (Six Feet Under) plays the title character, who works in forensics for the Florida police by day, and is a serial killer at night. Because of his job and upbringing by a police officer foster father (James Remar), Dexter knows how to cover his tracks while wearing his mask of humanity by day.  Slowly though, things start to take a turn when another serial killer with connections to Dexter's own mysterious past rears his head, and soon enough our title character is caught in a bloody game of cat and mouse.  What makes Dexter so good is the approach taken to the theme of the series by the creators and Hall himself.  What could have easily flopped and failed miserably instead evolves episode by episode as we attempt to see what makes Dexter tick.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well to say the least. Julie Benz (the vampiric Darla from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel) is superb as Rita: Dexter's rape victim girlfriend whom he keeps around so he doesn't have to bother with sex, HBO's Oz veterans Lauren Velez and David Zayas as fellow cops, and hottie Jennifer Carpenter (whom Hall has recently married, seriously) as Dexter's sister.  Not since Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer has there been an interesting and above all chilling glimpse into the mind of a madman that walks among us.  Spectacular, and definitely worth picking up even if you never caught the show on Showtime during it's first season run."
One of the best seasons of Dexter besides 4 and 7 in my opinion. With a great villain and awesome story this was a perfect start for everyone's new favorite serial killer.
"Season one sets the tone, pace and wildly engrossing phenomenon known as 'Dex'; a doughnut buying, deftly sincere serial killer who lives by a code.I'm often asked 'how can you watch a show about a serial killer?&#34; Easy, if the plots are interwoven, the circumstances bizarre and the outcomes unpredictable. I hope it stays off network TV, they don't deserve Dexter."
"I love this show. It definitely creates a yin and yang to the serial killer persona. Plan on ordering the other seasons. Item arrived on time, packaged well and as expected."
Honestly was surprised how watching a serial killer who kills other serial killers sucks a person into the show so easily.
"To this day I still believe the 1st season is still the best season out of all the dexters. The future seasons tend to drag on too much and dexter doesn't get enough kills by taking out bad people from the world. The first season has nearly one bad person in each episode that dexter eliminates but as the season progresses to 2,3,4,5,6 etc you find that Dexter starts to get bored and is surrounded by so much life drama bull crap that he can't even kill anymore bad guys!"
"...I dont know what it is.  It would be easy to drop the ball on this subject and make a bad series.  It is, after all, something that most people (fortunately) have little knowledge about, and it could attempt to be written for the masses, and ""dumbed-down"".  But its not.Dexter is chilling, but in an informative, eye-opening way that a good documentary does.  Michael C. Hall, who I thought was pretty wooden in Six Feet Under, plays the conflicted sociopath brilliantly.  A strong supporting cast strengthens and already strong show.I realize that being sympathetic to a seriel killer seems counter-intuitive, but it is the intelligence of the writers that draws you in to Dexter's world.  You ALMOST feel bad for the guy for the hand he's been dealt, and SOMEWHAT admirable for the way he's made lemonade out of his life's lemons.This show couldn't exist on network TV, and like many other ""rawer"" shows, needs a lot of room to run.  I'm interested to see how far they can take this series from a consistency standpoint, but if S2 and S3 are a fraction of S1's quality, I'll be there for the ride."
"This Showtime series stars Michael C. Hall as a sociopathic serial killer who targets only individuals he feels deserve his attention because of loopholes in the justice system.  Dexter is an expert on crime- scene blood splatters.  We often see him at crime scenes as the police and forensic experts put together how a crime was committed.Dexter is a sullen, strange guy who does his job well but has trouble relating to people.  In Season One, we learn his backstory.  His father, sensing an unnatural desire in his son to kill, councils the boy on how to channel his feelings so that innocent people aren't harmed.  These scenes reminded me of a superhero ""origins"" tale.  Depending on how you look at it, Dexter is either a hero who rids society of reprehensible, murderous villains, or an elusive criminal whose killing rampage must be stopped.  One thing, however, is certain.  Dexter is very cool, and is unlike any character on television.  Hall heads a fine cast in a sort of ""Law and Order"" series with a touch of the Grand Guignol.  Blu-ray bonus extras include the featurettes ""The Academy of Blood - A Killer Course"" and ""Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation,"" and the first episode of ""Dexter,"" Season Three."
"Dexter Morgan - blood Spatter Expert and Serial Killer. He's been living a double life for a while now and has kept that paart of himself shelves and out of the way. The only person who knew was someone from his past, and that person taught him a great many things on staying alive in such a mad world. Dexter also has a squad of people aroudn him you will get to know, a sister you will get to know even more, and a case you will grow to love featuring The Ice Truck Killer. In this episode we see Dexter (and see the overlap better book 1 and this season) and the way he sees blood, not to mention the Dark Passenger. We also see the ITK and the way he kills and the way Dexter admires the person's style.Its like living in Dahlmerland - that's how the book put it - except there are no rides (thank goodness).M.C. Hall is the PERFECT Dexter. After 3 seasons of him I can say he is the reason that Dexter connects with people and is not a monster to us. Watch the show - you will see. Jennifer C - his sister Deb - is also a unique personality here and you will grow to enjoy her. She has a sailor's mouth and keeps in shape and loves to pick the wrong type of people. She plays it to a tee. And the rest of the cast are great as well and, if you think you know how it all ends because you read the book, you are wrong. The book and this are different in a lot of ways AND the end is a strong part of it. So, readers, watch this as well.Closing this up, the twists and turns are great and learning about Dexter's past is a wild ride. You learn a lot in this season, too, and you see how Dexter was ""made."" You also see other things, bits that are spooky and the things he does away with, making you wonder exactly what the Dark Passenger is doing riding shotgun with Dexter.So many rules - so many graves. He is in the perfect place to be himself, that's for sure."
"A Showtime production, Dexter is an anomaly.  It is a brilliantly written, intriguing, and totally engrossing series, that is seldom predictable.  Besides a compelling storyline, and characters that seem real, what makes the series even more unique, is that the protagonist, Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a blood spatter expert for the Miami police, is a cold blooded murderer.Hall's unusual role is the key to the series, and his performance is a riveting, and captivating character study, that makes Dexter a very hard show to turn away from.  Morgan is guided by the `Code of Harry'.  Harry (James Remar) was Dexter's adoptive father, an ex-cop who recognized that his traumatized son, had homicidal tendencies.  To help him survive, Harry trained Dexter to channel his desire to kill in a 'positive' direction, by instilling the directive to kill only those who truly deserve to die.  This twisted morality is quite bizarre, and makes for fascinating viewing, as Dexter kills ceremoniously.Presumably to contain any spilled blood, plastic sheeting is typically spread all around the area, and Dexter himself is also covered with plastic sheeting.  Victims are taped down naked to a table top face up, helpless and unable to move.  After drawing a blood sample for his collection, Dexter gets to work.  The dead body is chopped into pieces, and the remains placed in trash bags.  Few of the grisly details are actually shown, but the presentation is still pretty chilling.  The series has a wicked sense of humor, as Dexter discusses his thoughts through narration, as he nonchalantly goes about his business, which includes murder.  Harry is dead, but appears frequently, in flashbacks.  Harry's biological daughter Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), also works for the Miami PD in homicide.  She is eager, enthusiastic, loves to swear, and has a problem with authority.The twelve episodes play like a chapters in a book.  Unlike most weekly series, the format does not always involve solving a particular case within the episode.  Instead, the story unfolds broadly and more naturally, with information about Dexter and his past, coming in small bits.  Dexter is dealing with coming to terms with his emotions, or lack thereof, and watching how this affects the evolution of his relationship with his girlfriend Rita (Julie Benz), is fascinating.  Benz's performance is pretty amazing, playing an abused woman trying to start a new relationship.The central underlying story concerns a serial killer known as `Ice Truck Killer', who specializes in neatly slicing up his victim's bodies into bloodless pieces.  The whole concept is diabolically macabre, and well executed.  The killer has taken a special interest in Dexter, and tension and suspense grows more intense, after the killer's identity is revealed with a few episodes left to go.  The killer has an elaborate plan, though he is forced to improvise when the pursuit begins to close in.  As Dexter begins to recall the horrific circumstances surrounding his mother's death, the killer makes his play.  The writing is outstanding, and keeps you off balance.  Approaching the conclusion, things get a little shaky in the turn, but control is reacquired, and Dexter finishes wildly and dramatically, with a stylistic flourish that does not cheat the viewer.Dexter is refreshingly different from most forensic procedurals.  Although dealing with violence and death, there isn't a lot of fighting, shootouts, or chases.  The focus is on character and story development.  While there are things that go over the top, or are illogical, unlike programs like the CSI franchise, the level of drama isn't routinely pumped up by threats, flashy violence, condescending dialog, or music.  The police in Dexter work `normally', with no overly dramatic background music, while routine tasks like, processing the crime scene, performing tests, or analyzing evidence take place.  The level of acting by almost everyone involved is excellent, from the minor characters to the leads.  The writing is not perfect, but the characters and their dialog, are mostly credible, showing the audience some respect.  There are no long winded pretentious speeches sprouting psychobabble, phony overdramatic situations, and characters trying to top each other, or engaging in supercop behavior.  Criminal Minds or CSI Miami, this is not.The series is far from perfect, and doesn't escape being ridiculous.  While a darkened room, draped with plastic sheeting, with a naked victim tapped down helpless, is a terrifying scene, it makes little sense, unless Dexter has giant rolls of plastic sheeting, and maybe a case of packing tape in his car.  The time it would take to actually prepare the scene, and put up all that sheeting would be ridiculous.  Tape and plastic sheeting are excellent for retaining evidence like fingerprints, would have to be destroyed.  Dexter disposes a couple of bags of body parts per kill, but what happens to all that tape and plastic sheeting?  Over the course of the season, Dexter takes chances, makes mistakes, and has several close calls, and is clearly under suspicion, at the conclusion, setting the stage for the next season.One of the few negatives is the lack of subtitles, and the inappropriateness of the extras.  Two episodes have commentary tracks, but some of the other bonus materials, are not directly related to the series.  The mini-documentary Witnessed in Blood, covers the forensics for an unrelated criminal case.  And two episodes of Showtime's series Brotherhood are included, presumably as an attempt to promote that series.  More material specifically relevant to Dexter, would certainly have been preferred.  Otherwise, needless to say, the series is highly recommended to fans of the forensic crime genre."
"I was hooked after the first episode.  I love the concept: a blood splatter expert who seconds as a serial killer that preys upon other serial killers.  Michael C. Hall seems as if he was born to play the role of Dexter.  Every season there seems to be one central character that Dexter must hunt down, amongst various other serial killers and murders that end up getting chopped up on his table.  This season follows Dexter&#8217;s pursuit of the Ice Truck Killer&#8212;a sadistic serial killer that chops bodies into pieces after draining all of their blood.  He&#8217;s named the Ice Truck Killer because it is believed that he drives around in an ice truck before dumping the bodies off.  Great pilot season.  If you have not seen this show, this is definitely one you do not want to miss."
"This isn't one of those shows or movies about a serial killer who just does it for fun.  Dexter Morgan targets people very specifically and only those whom he believes have crossed a line or violated one of his standards.  For example, Dex would never molest or kill a child, so he kills a man who has done such things to choir boys.  This is not a defense of Dex, just a clarification.What makes him even more complex is that he did not suffer abuse at the hands of his loving foster parents; he maintains a good relationship with his sister, a cop; he works as a forensic examiner for the police; he fakes emotions as best he can with  his girlfriend and her kids; and feels nothing at all, most of the time, unless it's a sense that he must get rid of someone.Michael C. Hall's performance and voiceover work are very strong. He's stretched out further than he could with his character on the late, great Six Feet Under."
"This series is absolutely one of the best cop shows I have ever seen.  One reason is because Vick goes beyond what is dictated by the law and this is what a lot of citizens would do if they had the chance.  At first I couldn't decide if he was a good cop or a bad cop but by the end of the series I came to believe that he is just a mix of both.I can not really rate season 5 by it's self because I actually do not see any difference in any of the seasons.  They are every one a spell binding, can't wait till I see the next one kind of a series.  One of the things that make it outstanding is that they don't use an episode as a stand alone show.  There are plots that continue through many episodes and mini plots that get solved in one episode.My wife and I stayed up way past our normal bedtimes many nights because we kept saying... lets watch just one more!"
Vic and the crew are a good ensemble cast who have so much going on in their lives you wonder how they'll pull it off
Each episode builds the crescendo of anticipation of how Mackey and his Strike Force is going to out-do the previous episode of ball busting and head knocking.
I have watched all six seasons and I am about to finish the series.  Every episode keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The roller coaster ride is never ending and I am going to miss the series when I finish.  I wish that there was something to take it's place.  Michael Chiklis and the rest of the cast step out of the story and grab you by the shirt and never let go.
"This series is one of the classics of all time. The characters are unforgettable and painted from  the broad strokes of good and evil and many shades in between.  The themes are here to examine the human condition on so many levels that at times it makes your head spin, particularly when you compare it to todays events. What a show!!!!"
"Good writing and acting make this show engaging season after season.  At the end of each you wonder where it could possibly go next, and yet the writing team always pulls it off."
I loved this show. I had never heard of it until recently and I'm glad I started watching it. Addicting.
A great series and this season turned everything upside down. Mackey and his crew are under fire and Forrest Whitaker is out to get them and bring them down. This was was one of the most emotional and shocking seasons ever for this great show. A must buy series if you love cop dramas. This is the best cop show. It is dark and it pulls no punches. Once you watch it you will want to see more. Show will have you hooked.
Season five sees the strike team under investigation yet again.  You know the writing is good when you want the do anything it takes cops to succeed. While every episode is great there will be some big shockers at the end of the season. I am really glad I have the chance to catch up on this well written if gritty show.
"Since this has been out for a while, and if you're researching season 5, hopefully you've already seen the 4 before it, I'll make it short.I've seen every episode of The Shield, and the finale of this season is one of the best episodes of TV - of ANY show - that I've ever seen.I think it's the second best season (second only to season 1) that this show has ever had.If you're a fan of the show, what are you waiting for?"
"I own all seven seasons of The Shield; if you like the show, this was one of the better seasons."
Great show always full of action and on the go. Its not a show for kids and some adults may find it offensive but if you can get past that you wont want to miss the next episodes.
Great show lots of suspense good acting keeps you Awake and goes quick fast pace show to bad it's off the air
"I gave this rating due to a lot of reasons, one being the level of excitement to keep you wanting more, the other for how the series so far turned out."
"If you purchase this DVD, make sure you watch the extras on disc 4. Forest Whitaker discusses how the Kavanaugh character was conceived as someone who ""becomes"" Mackey as he pursues him, and you will certainly see a transformation over the course of Season 5's eleven episodes. It would be very easy to over-hype Whitaker's contribution if it weren't so spot-on perfect. On DVD 4, series creator Shawn Ryan states that he wanted Whitaker for this character and there ""was no second choice."" If you remember the famous 1998 episode of NYPD Blue called ""Raging Bulls,"" in which Dennis Franz's Sipowicz and James McDaniel's Lt. Fancy come to explosive blows after a long, slow simmer, imagine what happens immediately after Kavanaugh asks Mackey in a rage-filled voice ""Are you happy NOW...Detective Mackey?"" There was a strong undercurrent of racial tensions between the NYPD Blue characters, which led (in a large part) to them both reaching the breaking point, but Mackey and Kavanaugh are not at odds with each other because of their ethnicity. Over the course of the entire season, the subject is never approached and it is not a relevant detail in the conflict. They're two men who began with the right motives and slowly let their circumstances determine their mission. There are mixed opinions surrounding the Glenn Close ""Capt. Rawling"" story arc experiment from Season 4. In a few short days, Whitaker is back for a second season as Kavanaugh, and the events of Season 5 were grounded more in risk taking than stunt scripting. The Shield is a brutal, intensely creative show with one of the best casts and creative teams on TV. By creating synergy with the events laid out in the pilot episode (and multiple references in the ""extras"" portion of the set to ""Shakespearean"" drama), it's clear that this series aims very, very high and more often than not hits the target."
"At the close of the fourth season of the Shield, there was reason for celebration.  As season five begins, not much seems to have changed.  Corrupt cop Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) and his Strike team are back together again, Antwon Mitchell (Anthony Anderson) is in prison, Rawling is gone, Aceveda (Benito Martinez) seems out of reach; it seems like it's business as usual.  Then everything changes.  Enter Forest Whitaker as Jon Kavanaugh, an IAD lieutenant who is making it his sole purpose in life to bring Vic down.  His method: using Lem (Kenny Johnson) as a blackmail tactic to rat out Vic.  But as we learn as the season progresses, not only do things not go as planned, but everything comes to a shocker of a conclusion that will have you beating the walls in anticipation for the sixth season.  Also going on during the season are a variety of things: Julian (Michael Jace) breaks in a new partner (Paula Garces) because Danny (Catherine Dent) is pregnant, Wyms (CCH Pounder) looks to take another shot at being the Captain, and Shane (Walt Goggins) makes a choice that will alter the course of the show forever.  As the credits roll after the season finale, it is clear that the end is quite near, which is bittersweet in a way, because if it's one thing that Shawn Ryan's gritty cop drama has proved, it's that prime time cable TV can be nothing less than spectacular."
"THE WRITING AND THE ACTING ARE SUPERB. IT JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER. THE BALANCE BETWEEN GOOD COP AND REALLY EVIL COP IS ALWAYS SURPRISING. IN SPITE OF ONESELF ONE ROOTS FOR THE BAD GUYS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES WHO WOULD LEAP INTO FLAMES TO RESCUE A VICTIM. THE BUILDUP OPF SUSPENSE MAKES BINGE WATCHING ALMOST A NECESSITY. AGAIN, MY ONLY CAVILS ARE THE EXPLICIT SEX AND NUDITY WHICH ARE GRATUITOUS AND NOT NECESSARY IN AN OTHERWISE SUPERB SERIES."
"This show isn't about feelings, but one of the best scenes in tv history makes two actors at the end really stretch their credentials. Shane and Lem really pull it off. The noose starts tightening for the strike team and their cheating ways."
If you have watched the previous 4 seasons you wont be disappointed with season 5. The characters are expanded upon and some new ones are introduced to keep things fresh.
I started at the beginning and am working my way through watching every season - when it first came out I did not think I would like it and now I am hooked - great acting and entertainment!!
Another season demonstrating the mix of good and not so good that makes up all people.  Adults only please - not a show for the kiddies or the timorous.
"My two favorite shows of the past ten years have been ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Shield.""  As ""The Sopranos"" limps into its final season--let's face it, that show hasn't had the same compelling intensity since its first three incredible seasons--""The Shield"" is still kicking major butt.The quality has never let up and I would highly recommend that you watch every season from the very beginning.  The writing is so inventive and the acting is just dynamite.I can't wait to see where they're going with this!"
"All roads for Vic Mackey (Emmy winner Michael Chiklis) lead to this. After Mackey killed Terry Crowley during the first season of ""The Shield"" karma was going to catch up with him sooner than later and now the Strike Team is under I.A.D. investigation by Jon Kavanaugh (Oscar winner Forrest Whitaker). Mackey seemed on the road to redemption during the fourth season when the new captain (Glenn Close)gave him the chance to reassemble his team and make a difference in the Farmington police district. The investigation that she instigated which was designed to exonerate members of her team has turned into crusade where Kavanaugh will use any and all teams to bring down Mackey and his team.By the fifth season of ""The Shield"" I was afraid the show would jump the shark--in fact it has done anything but that with writing that is still among the best on TV with morally complex characters sporting shades of gray to their personalities vs. being simple black and white caricatures of good guys and bad guys. Chiklis proves as he has over the last four seasons to be one of the best actors on TV with his complex portrayal of Mackey. Chiklis though wouldn't be where he is without the terrific supporting cast. During the fifth season Mackey's nemesis begins to resemble him as he tries to bring down Mackey and his team. Mackey may be morally corrupt person but there is still a decent person buried somewhere within his soul which allows fans of the series to be rooting for him even if he is often the bad guy (hey, he killed a cop in the first episode of the first season!).The show looks grainy and dark which benefits the cinema verite/documentary look of the show with its handheld cameras and unexpected pans. As always Dutch(Jay Karnes) and Claudette (CCH Pounder)continue to be the moral center and conscience of the show and as fascinating as Mackey and his team are, these two detectives are equally as fascinating as they bring down a serial killer with perfect alibies and other difficult to crack cases. The politically astute former Captain of the station David Aceveda (Benito Martinez)continues to have a darkness to his ""moral"" character particularly after the physical assualt at the hands of an ex-con that occurred during the third season.The DVD has some great special features including commentary tracks with a nice mix of cast members, a featurette on the productio of the fifth season, a tribute to executive producer/director Scott Brazil who died during the sixth season and a Q&A; session with Chiklis, producer/writer/creator Shawn Ryan and Forrest Whitaker discussing their characters and the development of the series. We also get deleted scenes as well as the sixth season ""prequel"" that sets up season six.The seventh season (which will air this spring)is reportedly the last season for the show so if you've caught the bug for ""The Shield"" but fallen behind in watching the show, now you can spent time either catching the reruns or watching the DVDs in plenty of time for season seven.Highly recommended."
Every episode was great!
Gritty action and lots of it.I detest crooked cops but these guys made you feel for them.Beware lots of blood....
"As a brand name, as a product, I trust South park to deliver entertainment quality more than any other.  the Simpsons were great at one time, but the tired series drags on, so DVD's of its latter years are as tired as its writing staff.  South Park on the other hand is as vibrant as it ever was.  The incredibly audacious creators of the series are the two most insolent creeps to ever blacken a studio.  However, funny is funny.  Moreover, whereas the Simpsons do not make many polical points (being in prime time on network tv), South Park makes few shows that do NOT have political points.  They skewer virtually everyone.  Who else would show Gene Siskel, the harmless affable film critic,and JFK, in hell?  They are at their best when WE are at our worst.  As we cower before threats from overseas, they did a brilliant piece about literally putting your head in the sand."
"With season 10 the South Park creators set out to give us something that would challenge the creators of Family Guy and would set out in challenging those who like the Family Guy comedy. They also set out in making a point about the whole showing an image of the Prophet Muhammad on national TV, they set out in making a point about freedom of expression and not allowing terror threats to scare them. Did they win that war? You'll have to watch this season to find out.Episode 1: The Return of Chef: In this episode we see Chef return to South Park after a time with the Super Adventure Club who we later learn that they are a group of explorers that show a special interest in the children of remote tribes. The boys have to cope with this change in Chef and the influence that the Super Adventure Club had on him. In reality this is the episode where we say goodbye to Chef for good, as in season 9 South Park had an episode called Trapped in the Closet which made fun of the ""Religion"" of Scientology. Isaac Hayes who was the voice of Chef is a Scientologist, he seemed to hold a double standard when making fun of religion. It's OK to make fun of Christianity, Judaism, Mormonism etc but as long as you don't make fun of Scientology it's OK but if you do then Hayes said goodbye to South Park. This is an amazing episode and is really enjoyable listening to Chef speak as it's chopped together dialogue from previous episodes.Episode 2: Smug Alert: ""I know, for this episode let's make fun of those people who drive environmentally friendly cars and suddenly think they're better than everybody else."" This is what Stone & Parker would have thought when coming up with the idea for this episode as they do just that. They pick up on the smugness of these people and tear them apart which is a very intelligent move by the creators. The story is simple; Gerald, Kyles dad is now the owner of a hybrid car and he suddenly feels it's his duty to insult those who have gas gusler cars. Gerald moves the family to San Francisco where everybody drives a Hybrid, but Stan being upset with this decides to write a song that will encourage more people to buy Hybrids which should get Kyle to come back home. This is a great episode with a great message about those people who to drive the hybrid cars, it takes the subject and says to those people ""I know you drive them, and I don't care.""Episode 3 & 4: Cartoon Wars Part 1 & 2: This is an episode that stirred up a lot of controversy as these two episodes were based around the whole image of Muhammad hysteria that was surrounding the media at the time. Stone & Parker had made the episodes with the clear intention of Comedy Central showing the image on TV and setting an example about freedom of speech but unfortunately it wasn't to be. The story of the episodes are that Family Guy are set to show an image of Muhammad in one of their episodes; Cartman being utterly offended by this sets out to put an end to Family Guy once and for all but he has one obstacle; Kyle. These are a great set of episodes that just rip Family Guy to pieces when talking about their comedy, the whole notion of Family Guy being written my Manatees is brilliant and when you really give it some thought you start to think to yourself, ""Well maybe this is possible.""Episode 5: A Million Little Fibers: This is by far the weakest episode of the bunch as it's an episode focusing directly on Towelie. He decides to write a book about his life but everything keeps going wrong and he can't get his book published because he's a towel. He assumes a human personality and changes his book around which becomes an instant success and Oprah Winfrey wants to put her name on this book. This is really one of the weakest episodes out of them all and I think was just a filler to get to the next great idea.Episode 6: Manbearpig: This is the typical insult episode that rips apart Al Gore over the movie he made called an Inconvenient Truth, it makes fun of the whole ""Look at me I'm an ex-president trying to keep the limelight"" that seems to surround Al Gore. He has a new theory in South Park and that's a monster that will be a danger to everyone, Manbearpig. Half man, half bear and half pig, he can't prove it but he's super serial.Episode 7: Tsst: I honestly don't think I've ever laughed so much at a South Park episode, Cesar Milan of the Dog Whisperer fame is called in to take control of Cartman and his bad behaviour. Using some techniques that would only usually be performed on Dogs, Cartman isn't happy about being humiliated and resorts to making some drastic plans for revenge.Episode 8: Make Love, Not Warcraft: Everybody has them, everybody has that one friend who would quite openly admit that they would rather spend the day on World of Warcraft than go outside and play. Parker and Stone set out to make fun of these kids and show them that they need to get out more, some people may find it harsh but some people like myself would find it utterly hysterical.Episode 9: Mystery of the Urinal Deuce: The world's biggest conspiracy of all time will finally be uncovered when Eric Cartman exposes the true culprit behind the September 11th attacks. How will that person prove his innocence and who really was behind 9/11. This is a funny episode that gives a big slap in the face of the conspiracy theorists, I can't help but think that Parker and Stone wanted to give their opinions on the subject in this episode rather than just be intelligent about it.Episode 10: Miss Teacher Bangs A Boy: Eric Cartman is selected to become South Park elementary schools hall monitor, so he dons the look of a bounty hunter and sets out to clean up the halls. He accidentally stumbles upon a teacher in a relationship with a student and wants to put a stop to it. A very good episode with some strong home truths.Episode 11: Hell On Earth 2006: Satan is throwing the biggest Halloween costume party ever, and no one will be admitted without a wristband. Every detail must be perfect for the prince of darkness. But even Satan can't foresee everything. A prominent religious organization, an ex-lover and the antics of the most notorious serial killers of all time threaten Satan's fun. A complete slaughtering of the my Super Sweet 16 girls which I personally feel was long overdue from the South Park guys.Episode 12: Go God Go Part 1: South Park Elementary faces strong opposition to the topic of evolution being taught to the 4th graders. The most vocal protests are from Ms. Garrison who has to teach it. Eric Cartman can't be bothered with what's going on in class. He's busy manipulating his own personal time-line to align with the precise release date of the Nintendo Wii. A great satirical episode that this time doesn't poke fun at the notion of religion but pokes fun at a world without religion, would we all really get along like Richard Dawkins says we would?Episode 13: Go God Go Part 2: Last week Eric Cartman froze himself in an attempt to make his three-week wait for a hot, new, gaming device pass quickly. A freak accident landed him over 500 years in the future and now he's stuck there. The future is a tumultuous place with warring factions, angry sea otters and no Nintendo. Will Cartman find a way back to his own time? A humorous look on a future without religion, how would we find a way to keep fighting if we don't have the excuse of religion.Episode 14: Stanley's Cup: Stan Marsh has hit rock bottom. He's got no job, no bicycle and his only way out of a bad situation, is to coach the local pee wee hockey team. Once a hotshot pee wee hockey player himself, Stan Marsh has tried to put those days behind him. But he's still living with the memory of how let his team down when he missed the winning shot in the big game. Now, he's about to find out that being a coach means facing your past. He's determined to show his kids what it's like to be a winner! Personally I didn't understand this episode and it wasn't very good, the whole children having cancer thing I think was simply for shock value.A really good season with two 2 parters that would have you thinking and laughing at the same time which is a trademark of South Park."
"South Park is about the only consistently dependable TV show and the ""Go God Go"" 2-parter carries all the hallmarks of the franchise's best episodes. Somehow the A and B plots of this story involve an impatient Cartman freezing himself into the future because he can't wait 3 weeks to play a Nintendo Wii, Mr(s) Garrison dating Richard Dawkins, and an atheistic future war involving humans and otters. If you're a South Park fan, this is a must-watch episode."
"These guys don't pull any punches and that is why I love this show so much. This is another great season with up to the moment topics on real life! With all the pussyfooting around these days, this is a breath of fresh air....even after 10 seasons!"
"The landmark season of South Park saw Matt Stone and Trey Parker's animated series back on top thanks to some scathing, satirical moments and just plain animated lunacy.  It also saw the departure of Isaac Hayes, the voice of Chef, who departed after the previous season's lampooning of scientology and Tom Cruise.  His departure is spoofed in the opening ""Return of Chef"" which uses archive sounds of Hayes' voice as Chef returns to South Park brainwashed by the Super Adventure Club, and seeling to ""re-connect"" with children.  Things only get better as Kyle's dad buys a hybrid car in ""Smug Alert!"", Al Gore seeks attention from anyone with ""Manbearpig"", Cartman's mom turns to the Dog Whisperer in ""Tsst!"", Satan has a killer Halloween party in ""Hell on Earth 2006"", and Cartman seeks to freeze himself in anticipation for the release of the Nintendo Wii in ""Go God Go"".  The best moments of the season however came with the two part ""Cartoon Wars"" which hilariously lampooned Family Guy, and it makes sense in a way you've never imagined.  ""Make Love, Not Warcraft"" satires the players of the incredibly popular online RPG, and ""Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy"" finds little Ike having an illicit affair.  The only downpoint of the season is the closing ""Stanley's Cup"" which finds Stan coaching a terrible pee-wee hockey team, for no apparent reason.  This episode just isn't funny, at all.  Despite that though, every other episode here in the tenth season is a winner, and ten years and still going strong, South Park proves that these kids are quite alright."
"Episodes like ""TSST"" (the Dog Whisperer episode) and ""The Mystery of the Urinal Deuce"" (featuring the Hardly Boys) are funnier the second and third time around.  The show is uneven, sure, but basically an American treasure.  The real prizes in this season are the 2-parters, the ""Family Guy"" 2-parter and the ""Go God Go"" 2-parter featuring Cartman in the 25th Century.  If you haven't seen either of those, you've missed out on some of the best TV ever aired."
A heartbreaking but realisitic version of the suffering of the Jews and the misconception of what should have been and turned out to be something more horrible. Great photos and exact images made you feel like you were right there in person.
"Exceptionally well presented documentation of the pathway to Auschwitz (Poland). This presents the Nazi ideology from the inception of the T-3 euthanasia program for disposing of those (ethnic Germans) who were mentally ill or suffered from other medical problems to the extermination of all peoples considered 'unworthy of life' and prisoners of war. . .  Poles, Russians and Jews. From a small pre-war barracks for Polish soldiers, it follows the path to the mass slaughter house it became during WWII. Included are multiple aspects of the killing process and how it evolved. Original architectural designs, diaries and personal interviews with both the SS and survivors accompanied by original footage (Ukrainian) and psychological profiles offers an overview of all that became Auschwitz.Video and narrative are well suited for those who prefer not to be exposed to all the sensationalism and gore often found in so many of these documentaries. Education and informative, an accurate presentation of Nazi ideology and euthanasia.The BBC series offers the opportunity for a comprehensive review of the consequences for both perpetrator and victim. For those that survived death, the path 'home' wasn't as simple as one might think. Russian POW's were suspected of being 'spies' and relegated to the Gulags of Stalin's era. Others trying to return home found themselves victims of the Russia army and perhaps worst of all, deprived of their homes and possessions without any legal recourse.  A tragic end to what is still considered one of humankind's worst nightmares."
"Taken from this perspective and from the notes of the Nuremburg trials, excellent 'history' lessons.  Made me want to read more of what actually took place that modern history books don't really address."
"The producers of this program really attempted to accurately portray historical events, so much so at times it was difficult to remember that the program was an reenactment."
"I knew about Auschwitz, of course...conceptually I knew what had been done there and I knew the horror of it.  I just didn't grasp the full depth of WHY, nor did I realize how things were done.  This documentary series is mind opening.  It uses recently discovered plans and recreates what things would have looked like, it interviews people who made it through, it tells the story of the countless people who did NOT make it through and it helps us see with even greater clarity that this kind of atrocity must never ever be allowed to occur again."
I thought I have seen all there is to see about the insane horrors of this place but this series tells a little more about why and how these people went through more than you can imagine and some survived to tell us.  Man cannot rule man.
If you were not altogether up on the Nazi period or if you were to young to really know about the Nazi's &#34;final solution&#34; this series will certainly bring the horrors of that preriod front & center!!
"how horrendous that such cruelty and depraved indifference not only occurred BUT was then perpetrated again and is still happening in the world. We will never know the gifts to humanity that were destroyed there.....the brilliant minds, the spectacular voices, the symphonies unwritten, the cures not found....it reminds me of the holocaust of abortion here in the U.S."
"The subject matter is appalling in itself.  It is difficult to detach yourself emotionally from the horrors that were inflicted at Auschwitz.But, it is a BBC production and with that comes thorough, authoritative, accurate and objective presentation of the subject matter.It is worth watching as an historical document and not for entertainment, which it certainly is not!  I believe everyone should see this from the standpoint of understanding what a despotic and/or dictatorial regime can accomplish if left unchecked.  When one person can rule an entire nation by personal decree as opposed to a balanced law making process, then anything and everything is possible, even to declaring a portion of your own population to be a dangerous enemy.  There are lessons to be learned here."
"Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State makes for compelling viewing. It is divided into 6 chapters. The first chapter is titled ""Surprising Beginnings"" which basically introduces us to the origins of Auschwitz and how it was not initially designated as an extermination camp for Jews, but basically to house Polish political prisoners and later Russian POWs. In fact, the first gassing experiments in the camp were targeted at the Russian POWs.In the second chapter ""Orders and Initiatives"", we learn of the plans of Hitler, Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich to kill the Jews on a massive scale. Auschwitz is prepped for this purpose by the construction of gas chambers and the use of Zyklon B, a form of poisonous gas that was initially used to exterminate vermin and a disinfecting agent. We also learn about the Lodz Ghetto and its infamous Jewish leader, Rumkowski who seemed a controversial character in oppressing his own people, though not spared death himself, in the end. The crude initial gas chambers at Auschwitz are also shown, in reconstructions.In the third chapter ""Factories of Death"", the documentary explores how the systematic annihilation of the Jews was put into full operation, stretching all over Europe with Auschwitz being the center of extermination. The French authorities are also portrayed as being complicit in helping transport masses of Jews out of France to the ""east"". The other camps of death are also discussed such as Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor. It also mentions what happened to children of adult Jews who were sent off to work in the camps.The fourth chapter ""Corruption"" focusses on the blatant appropriation of murdered Jews and other peoples' belongings and valuables for the use of the Third Reich. Rudolf Hoess, the commandant of Auschwitz himself was removed from his position under charges of corruption [though he would return later to oversee mass killing on an astronomical scale]. This chapter also mentions Dr Josef Mengele, the infamous Nazi doctor of death, and also about the setting up of a brothel in the camp. Most importantly, this episode also deals with the resistance against the Nazi oppressors, most famously the uprising in Sobibor.The fifth chapter ""Murder and Intrigue"" deals with the playing out of international politics during the last nine months of 1944 and how nothing much was done by the Allies despite knowing by then that the jews and other innocents were being systematically and mechanically murdered by the Nazis. This was much to the detriment of the Hungarian Jews in particular, for they were deported to their deaths at a time where the gas chambers and crematoriums at Auschwitz in particular were operating at their optimum capacity. It also focusses on the Sonderkommando, the Jewish inmates who were forced to help process new arrivals designated for gassing, collecting their possessions, and disposing of their corpses.The final chapter ""Liberation and Revenge"" deals with how the Nazis tried to conceal their atrocities towards the end of the war. It also covers some of the trials of the Nazi war criminals after the war, the impact of liberation on the surviving camp inmates etc.Each chapter has at the end an interview between Linda Ellerbee with various personalities, mainly members of faculty of universities about the issues raised by each chapter.The series is not only well-put together with the extensive research compiled, but also the reenactments of historical events with actors and actresses [which I felt enhanced the series and not detract from it], the computer generated graphics of the camps as they were [they are mainly ruins now], and also most importantly, the testaments of the survivors in the present. It is a truly heartwrenching experience to see and hear these brave souls relive their horrific memories of such a bleak period in the history of mankind. A must-watch. I would also recommend ""Shoah"", a documentary that has more testimonies by survivors on the horrors they endured during World War Two."
"The answer to the riddle is in the tittle. Once again Aunt Jane has to sort things out when a friend Ruth asks her to look in on her sister, Carrie Louise. You anticipate that Carrie has had it. And you meet many unbalanced and speedy characters. While you are watching you can miss the whole thing as they do it with mirrors.Well paced and the perfect English actors to match each part."
"I'm not giving away any plot information!  Suffice it to say that, as always, Hickson gives a superb performance and I hope to eventually own all the Miss Marple's with her in them.  You won't be disappointed with this movie as it stays fairly close to the book."
i started with season 1 friday the 11th of april. just got done with season 8 ..thuday april 18...i gorged myself with it..and fell in love with Keith Sutherland.. i hear he's coming back.. season 9 can hardly wait.
"Yet another blazing, edge of your seat thrilling 24 hours in LA.  We lose a few more personnel but still manage to muddle through large scale corruption and the worst terrorists ever"
More exciting than any current TV show!  I watch this on my tablet every night...never miss if I can help it.
"Each season is better than the last one, and that is saying a lot because they are ALL unbelievable!  I recommend this show to any age.  I am so addicted to this show!"
This dvd set rocks! This whole season is killer! Buy it people you won't regret it period! Plus it came in great shape! I would recommend this series to anybody!
Every episode has some serious problem that Jack Bauer seems to solve at the risk of his own life (and others also). Love this show.
"When this first came out I said bah! don't like donald sutherland, probably won't like his son, so I never watched it when it was on tv.When I got amazon prime, I was watching Life, loved that, 24 kept coming up as a recommended show, so I said what the heck?? Wow, it is so engaging, I'd stay up til 4am watching episode after episode.It would be nice if 24:Redemption was free to watch too, anyone want to loan me theirs? was it made into DVD?Some of the twists in season 6 seemed rather implausible but whatever, I won't go into it. Love the show, looking forward to watching the rest of it."
"What can you say...Jack Bauer is awesome!  You may have to suspend reality about the believability of the scenario, but the writers always play it out well."
"Season 6 has varied reviews and a number of unhappy people, who claim that 24 is falling apart.  I feel killing almost everyone in season 5 resulted in much of the dissatisfaction with season 6.  The new people have no history and no claim to our affection.  If we are not watching someone we like and care about, we night think to much.  This is something the writers need to consider, the people are what makes the show and they need to be preserved.The story line is standard and not deep.  This is not a ""who done it"" or a deep thought provoking drama.  Plots and sub plots have been taken from past seasons and put together for a new story line.  During any hour, something occurs designed to make us want to watch the next hour.  As the clock ticks down 59:57, 59:58 something is happening that requires us to watch the next hour.  This is a cliffhanger and a darn good one!Jack, I agree with Secretary Heller.  You are cursed to provide us with high-energy entertainment that is great fun as long as we don't think to much.  The series is much better on DVD, without commercials and waiting for next week."
Jack Bauer comes to the government's rescue once again! This is another great season of 24 and what is awesome about this season is we finally meet some of the main antagonist that are responsible for many of the tragedies that have occurred in Jack's life! A must see season of 24!!
"I've been addicted to 24 since the first season. The writers have a great sense of the Homeland Security, FBI and CIA. Just when you think you have the episode figured out, they throw a twist in and changes up everything. If you haven't had the opportunity to see this awesome program give yourself a treat and check it out. I promise you will enjoy 24 very much and possibly become addicted as I have become.It's really a great TV program."
How they even come up with this stuff is beyond me!  This show is great and it is even more awesome that it is included with Amazon Prime!  Thanks Amazon!
"Jack Bauer is a moral avenger and  just when we need such a phenomenon.  Jack treats terrorists like they treat others.  Also the series allows a lot of good acting and shows off a lot of articulate minds.We get to see justice, something the federal government is in the business of squashing."
We are catching up no 24 so we can watch the new series.  We have become hooked on the drama of this show and are sorry we didn't watch it while it was such a big hit.  it is now a BIG hit for us.
Nonstop action.  Fascinating PLOTS all interwoven during the course of a day.  Top notch ACTING of fully believable and  intriguing characters.
I am re-watching the last three seasons to refresh myself.  With the new season coming up I can't wait.  Such an awesome show it really is top notch.
"I can't say enough about 24, I LOVE each and every Season and Episode.  If you like action, you will be at the edge of your seat with this Season.  We are VERY hooked and stream from one to the next episode."
"Keifer Sutherland is outstanding and all characters are appealing.  New characters come into shows and stay for a while, and the stories always have unexpected twists and turns.  The one thing you can expect is great acting, interesting plots, and unexpected turns.  It's great to watch."
More of Jack Bauer and his over the top method of saving America from terrorists. Very intense at tomes. Enjoy all of it.
I loved 24 when it was on tv and now after years I still love it.  All the seasons are the bomb.  LOL
Not sure which season was my favorite.  I truly liked David Palmer as Pres so maybe Season 1and the final season when Chloe took on a commanding role.
"Each episode is full of surprises, thus it was very difficult to quit watching. I was never be a fan of &#34;24&#34; before I start watching over Amazon Prime. Now, I love it. After finishing Season 6, I have reverted back to Season 1 and am still enchanted."
"I *think* this is the episode where someone FINALLY says to Jack what I'd been thinking for about 50 episodes already.""You're cursed, Jack.""THANK YOU. This poor guy. It's like he's got a little black cloud of bad luck that follows him around. Sure, he can pull YOUR bacon out of the fire, but HIS house will burn down in the process.That being said, it make me love Jack and root for him all the more. ""PLEASE let this man have SOMETHING good happen. ANYTHING."""
"Though widely-regarded as the weakest season (barring early feedback about the just-released Season Seven) of the TV series ""24"", I still found the season to be just as emotionally compelling and intense as any of the previous efforts.I will admit that, for (at least for me) the first time in show history, the late-season plot (regarding a piece of circuit board machinery) became a bit unbelievable.  Of course, all of ""24"" requires the viewer to suspend reality just a bit, but this time it seemed completely implausible that Jack Bauer would be allowed to complete his task.  Aside from that, however, this season created some very thrilling moments and acting, including (my highlights):-The introduction of some other Bauer family members (let's just say they don't share Jack's patriotism).-The ""Islamic prejudice"" storyline that mirrors the feature film ""The Siege"" in its high drama.-The acting of Vice President Noah Daniels (played by Powers Boothe), who mirrors the inspired performance of Gregory Itzin (Charles Logan) from Season Five, who also makes an appearance in this season.-The return of Jack Bauer from his detainment in China and how (or if?) he is able to transition back into normal society.As usual, the intensity of Kiefer Sutherland's Bauer as well as the ""staff"" of CTU Los Angeles turn in great performances, with special props given to James Morrison as Bill Buchanan.Thus, I cannot see where others saw this season falling short of previous efforts, as I found it to continue the ""24"" tradition of exciting plots, great acting, and mind-boggling twists and turns along the way."
"This was the best season of Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea starring Richard Basehart a hugely underrated American actor who has performed on stage, screen, and many guest starring dramatic roles on various TV series, movies made for TV, specials, and also has narrated many outstanding documentaries and has a career that spans from the 1940's until his passing September of 1984. The stories in the first two seasons were taught, gritty, with many of the episodes involving cold war espionage and a few aliens and undersea monsters tossed in here and there. Seasons 3 and 4 contained more monsters and aliens and centered more on fantasy. This was a show that was geared for all ages. Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea has been around since it originally aired on ABC on September 14, 1964 and has been run on many networks in syndication since it went off the air in 1968. All 110 episodes have also been released on DVD which I also own and I recently decided to buy season 1 on instant stream to go along with the other TV series and movies I have in my video library. I like the convenience of instant stream videos because I don't have to get up to change DVD's.  I only have one negative thing to say about this and that is why seasons 2, 3, and 4 are not available on instant stream. I would like to see the rest of the series be made available in this format. It saves the wear and tear on my DVD's. Unfortunately FOX released Voyage on double sided DVD's and those don't seem to hold up well with a lot of use. I really wish FOX had not skimped on the quality of the DVD's for this and other series they have released on double sided DVD's. I believe there will come a time when everything will be on instant stream and there won't be any more DVD's to hassle with."
"One of the great things about DVD is that classic television shows can be not only recalled but watched again. Some of them upon second viewing make you think ""Did I really think this show was good?"". But then again others make you realize that the shows you enjoyed from your youth were not just memories but were actually good shows. VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA is one of those series.As with the previous releases of the series, SEASON 4 VOLUME 1, holds up as well as the rest. The improvement of color over black and white is an obvious one when comparing to season one. But the characters have now had a chance to develop on screen and become familiar to us all. Too bad the series left the air not long after.The sixties gave us some of the greatest science fiction television ever seen. As early as THE TWILIGHT ZONE and moving forward to THE OUTER LIMITS we had anthologies that held our attention. And as for serialized tales, we had the original STAR TREK and more. No person helped this era out more so than Irwin Allen.Allen was the creator of some of the most remembered sci fi series from the time including THE TIME TUNNEL, LOST IN SPACE, LAND OF THE GIANTS and of course VOYAGE. Each of these series has had a release to DVD and have had the opportunity to give those of us children of the sixties the chance to relive those moments that held our attention each week, an hour at a time, as we watched incredible worlds unfold before our eyes.As for VOYAGE, the story mixed a combination of military and peacenik in one. It told the tales of the submarine Seaview, a high tech sub designed and operated by Admiral Nelson (Richard Basehart), a man who sees great things for the future and who uses his sub not as an offensive weapon but as a means to an end to help people around the globe.Along with Nelson are several main characters. The main one of these was Capt. Lee Crane (David Hedison), his second in command. While Nelson offered an elder statesman, Crane was the young eye candy to draw in girls, a man of action who took control when needed. Robert Dowdell as Lt. Comdr. Chip Morton, Del Monroe as Kowalski and Arch Whiting as Sparks helped round out the all male cast as they tackled world crises around the globe, saving the world over and over again.This particular season gave us a number of items to be concerned about opening with an episode that showed the Seaview tossed about was a volcano was about to blow cracking the world in two. Vincent Price paid a visit to the Seaview as a puppeteer who took control of various crewmen. A well loved plot device of the sixties, the ability of a bad guy to transform his appearance to do harm to whoever he chose was used. And time travel was brought into the picture again as well.VOYAGE played out like STAR TREK taken to inner space instead of outer and with an all male crew instead of one more integrated. But then TREK was in the future and VOYAGE in the present. Scenes of both ships being tossed about due to either underwater explosions or photon torpedoes gave us the cast tossing themselves about from side to side of the set. One could expect anyone from either cast feeling comfortable changing sets.For me it was glorious to watch as the flying sub once again lifted off out of the bottom of the Seaview and broke surface to fly across the sky. Like many I was lucky enough to have purchased the Aurora model kit and make my own flying sub to take a place of honor on the top of my desk. To find one today means a prolonged ebay search and paying an arm and a leg. Better it remains a fond memory.Not so this series. It no longer has to be a memory. Instead it is something that can be enjoyed again and again. And it can be shared with my son and later perhaps my grandchildren.One of the best things that we can take with us, those of us who watched these shows when they were fresh and new, is the sense of hope that they offered. Rather than a post apocalyptic world of bombed out buildings and survivors clad in furs and remnants of clothing, we were shown a world where we could use science to help build a better world. We were offered a world where not just races and genders got along but aliens as well. Wouldn't it be great if the world had that same sense of hope once more? Perhaps sharing these old television shows might just be the first step in that direction."
"Great story....and one of the few genre shows that the ivory tower &#34;brain trusts&#34; have allowed to survive and develop. For what its worth, if you are getting into this show late, these boxed sets have gone on sale for something like $9.00 each right around Christmas the last couple years."
I love this tv show!  My daughter introduced it to me and I couldn't stop watching it.  I've also bought and watched the 3rd Season.  Very good!!
"This review has one slight spoiler in terms of what the brothers hunt in a single episode... you've been warnedThis season of Supernatural gives us a dose of comedy many probably wouldn't expect from a show that is ""scary"". But the scary ramps up too. Everything escalates. The plot of Season One is extended greatly as Sam tries to track down others 'like him'. We get great guest stars (Katharine Isabelle from the Ginger Snaps films; Linda Blair.... LINDA BLAIR! from the Exorcist)and we witness the come back of one who becomes a fan favourite: Jim Beaver's Bobby Singer. We also see what became fan favourite episodes such as 'Heart' (werewolf alert), 'What is and What Should Never Be' (djinns), and &lt;SPOLIERS>  ----- 'Tall Tales' (a Trickster, a la Coyote, Anansi, Loki, etc)&lt;/SPOILERS)>.Religion comes to a head, and it is easy to see that it is going to intrinsic to future episodes. Hindu and Muslin faith enters center stage, and they do it well, given as much or more reverence than the Catholic and Christian dogma. Perhaps the greatest achievement of  this season is that the writers merge the 'monster of the week' theme by making those monster hunts have some allusion to the metaplot or even fuel the the on-going episodes. So just a head's up: the show is quickly veering into theological discovery. But - they are smart enough not to shove it down anyone's throat.Now, for the fun stuff: the CGI is outright brilliant this season, and it only gets better as the season go on. The audio is set for 5.1 Dolby Digital. As for Special Features, they are the ho-hum variety but made oh some not ho-hum by the crew and cast. It is easy to see these guys love their work. We have a few commentary tracks, deleted scenes on a few of the episodes, a 'making of' in regards to the second jaw-dropping finale.This show is just getting started."
A good follow up to the first season. The cliffhanger from season one is answered. You meet a lot of interesting players in this season and the main vilian is no joke. A must buy series if you are into good action and a well told story.
"This second season becomes tricky since it starts with the father's death and ends with his temporary resurrection in order to be redeemed. At the same time Dean is dying and his father exchanges his own life for Dean's but yet gives Dean the mission to look after Sam and save him, or kill him if he can't protect and save him. It ends with Dean doing the same bargaining as his father for the life of Sam who was killed in the dead western city of Cold Oak. Dean manages to get one year of living before he is reclaimed.This second season tells us too a little more about the demons. Apart from the everyday black-eyed demons who are tortured souls that stopped being human and became demons, there is a particular and more powerful one, the yellow-eyed demon, and though we are not told what or who he really is, he is what we can call a higher class demon. He is the one who accepted to take John's life in the place of Dean's. He is the one who has chosen Sam for a special mission that will be uncovered during this second season. What is that mission?Strangely enough all the hunting is for that yellow-eyed demon nothing but training for Sam and the training is not only directed at Sam. This second season is focusing on the hunting by the two brothers of the yellow-eyed demon. But, this seems to be part of a plan elaborated by him to train Sam and make him understand his importance and his uniqueness. With others like him, that are called ""psychic"" in the series, they have been selected by this special demon to accomplish a task, that is to say lead the demonic army that is to break loose from Hell. Of these ""psychic"", Sam will meet four of them, but there are more, all born on the same year 1983, and whose mothers all died in a nursery fire. We come across them now and then but they do not seem to be very resilient. In a final attempt at selecting the right ""general"" to bring in the armies of Hell out of the deep,he brings together four psychic and a black veteran from Afghanistan (who also has special abilities in a dead western city, Cold Oak in South Dakota, for the sole survivor to accomplish the mission.The Black chap, Jake, will manage, under blackmail from the yellow-eyed monster and menaces against his mother and sister, to kill Sam by cutting his spine through. He is an obviously well trained GI. But Dean will manage to revive Sam by a trip to Crossroads Inn, Mississippi to meet with a crossroad demon, that grants wishes that was tracked down in a previous episode, and to bargain his life against Sam's. He will get a one year survival time for himself. But that enables the two brothers to go to Bobby who had noticed that evil and demonic elements were concentrating around a special zone in Wyoming.Sam will actually find out that in this sector there is a cemetery and a crypt in the center, built by Samuel Colt surrounded by churches connected by railroads building up a pentacle or pentagram, which is called in the series a ""devil's trap"", that can imprison demons if they enter it. The crypt in the cemetery is supposed to be the gate to hell, the gateway through which the armies of Hell will invade the earth. This is an important specification in the series. Several episodes are openly dedicated to Catholic beliefs: angels for one, but also a Catholic priest in a Catholic church who is shot dead on the steps to his church and cannot receive the last rites. He becomes a haunting ghost and is redeemed by the priest of the church.This leads to a discussion that emerges several times on the existence of angels. Dean does not believe. Sam does believe. This definitely gives the series a Christian if not Catholic ring, especially with the number of times the Catholic exorcizing rite or ritual chant is used, though it is never uttered by a priest in the series, which makes it surprisingly iconoclastic. Never people believing in exorcism would consider a lay man could perform the rite. It is the same thing with the use of holy water. For example when Ellen, the inn-keeping lady of the roadside diner that is a meeting place for spirit hunters, comes at the end of the season for help after her diner and everyone in it were burnt to ashes, she is asked to drink a glass of holy water to make sure she is not possessed. This is definitely Catholic, but at the same time always performed by non-believers or even atheists. This is a reference to a religion from the point of view of people who are totally unconcerned by it as if you may not believe in God but God believes in you. Does he?The special gun John Winchester had saved and kept for its final task and that he had traded with the yellow-eyed demon for Dean's life and that still had one special bullet, was in fact the key to the door of the crypt that enables the armies of hell to come into this world. But the weapon only and not the bullet. The gun was recuperated, too late, by the Winchesters and the bullet killed the yellow-eyed demon, or can we be sure it did?That's when the tale turned ironical and sour. The poor Jake who had accepted, willy nilly and more nilly than willy, to be the servant of the demon did manage to open the gate and thus to enable the yellow-eyed demon to enter the final pentacle, but he was shot on the spot by the Winchesters. He probably died smiling since he thus saved his mother and his sister. But he got nothing out of the deal at all. That's the irony of those devilish missions: the possessed do what they are supposed to do, and at times it takes a lot of energy from the demon to convince them. Like in this special case, where Jack has a mission that a demon or a possessed human could not accomplish since they could not enter the pentacle, but otherwise demons only take possession of human bodies and use them as ""meat suits""But this second season has a touch of itself first of all in the constant debate about the worthiness of the fight, the worthiness of one brother being ready to die for the other and vice versa (if it were true they might even die together one on top of the one on top of himself.) This debate is constant, deep in many ways and perfectly well acted for us to believe that what is mostly a verbal claim no one ever makes true is probably true for these two brothers. That the father accepts to die in the place of his sons is normal since his sons are his heirs, his continuation into eternal human life. But for two brothers it is surprising especially since in our common vision of two brothers, even twins, and these are no twins, there is always some amount of hostility when it is not hatred and jealousy, which is indeed present in these two brothers. That can be explained by the fact they grew up apart from the world, taking care of each other while their father was hunting this yellow-eyed demon that killed his wife/their mother. Also, the animosity would rather be localized between Sam and John, Dean being the lever, the path between these two characters that have antagonistic trajectories.Those two brothers are so much in love with one another that they are ready to sacrifice their whole life for an adventure together. This is not inhuman. This is superhuman. This is an idealistic vision and the actors make us believe it is true, possible. That level of intimacy between two brothers is admirable and beautiful, even if, deep behind my mind's eye I kind of doubt it a little bit.There is a last remark I want to make on this season. The South was finally represented this year with Mississippi, but in a rather unfavorable light as a place of demons, curses and other devilish traffics. Yet Mississippi is the place where the resurrection of Sam is purchased. We are no longer dealing with anything Christian here but with something like voodoo, the originally African religion of the Blacks in the South that has survived in spite of all the Christianizing performed by the whites over the centuries.But this leads to the plain fact that all black characters are evil in a way or another, either because they are easily manipulated by some demon or evil mind, or because they are sort of genetically evil, even Special Agent Victor Henricksen, who is shown as unable to see beyond his book of rules, and who is turned upside down and made a fool of by the two Winchester brothers and their female and not so much experienced lawyer. And fooled is a euphemism: he turns out to be a plain dummie. But the FBI agent will remain on the tracks of course because he is a Fox Beyond and you may choose, Insanity, Intelligence, Intuition or Impotence.We could say that they are doing wrong while hoping to do good : nave would be a better word to describe them. Jack is hoping to save the ones he loves, but doesn't understand that the whole planet will die, while the Winchesters brothers are willing to die for the sake of humanity. The FBI agent is not trying to understand what is going on but wants to catch two fugitives that are threats to his un-supernatural world, where a ghost belongs in a book. He is too rational to understand, maybe to good at what he does to think outside his pragmatic, Cartesian referential mind. And he lacks the creativity or the beliefs that what is really and what he sees are two different things.The season ends well since it has finally redeemed the father and created a tremendous suspense as for the future since in twelve months Dean will die. That's not much time with all the evil spirits that have been released from hell.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU with the help of Ivan EVE"
"This is another fun filled, action packed, well written season with the Winchester clan.  You just can't go wrong with this set...something for everyone here!!"
"This show is amazing. I know what you're thinking. Two pretty boy actors on a CW show? Can't be any good. But brace yourselves. They actually keep their shirts on! In fact, they're usually wearing layers. The show takes itself seriously, gives a lot of love to monster mythology and does a tremendous job of going through season story arcs. Season 2 is where they start to have a little more fun in the show and the dark humor shows up. They really begin to find their stride. If you've somehow missed this show, you need to correct that mistake right now."
If you are a fan of the show you want to have this dvd set.  I love the outtakes and extras it makes paying for the set worth it.
"you have gotta check out Supernatural. At first glance I thought that a CW horror show would suck, but this baby doesn't shy away from the gore at all. The classic rock music really sealed the deal for me, not to mention the hot chick of the week vibe it has going for it. The two main dudes, Sam and Dean, who can make or break a show like this, are both very natural and easy to root for. The second and third seasons are much stronger than the first (which is also great, save for the episode ""Bugs"") with almost every episode ranging from very good to great. The ""monsters of the week"" are always interesting and the major storyline for the whole season really makes you feel the show is heading somewhere. So hop in the 1967 Chevy Impala and go for a ride."
"Sam and Dean are back, with new Hunters to help them out.  With time running out, and the Yellow Eyed Demon out there, it's a race to get find him, and avenge their dad.  And Soon, Dean makes a shocking deal."
"From the tear-jerking premiere to the virtually perfect season finale, Season Two of ""Supernatural"" once again demonstrates how much better genre shows get in their second seasons.  Take a look at ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" a show which, by the way, has a heavy influence on this wonderful series.  BtVS, like ""Supernatural,"" had humble beginnings, but blew the audience and critics away with a stellar second season.  ""Supernatural"" does the very same.Everything that was good about the show in the first season was strengthened here.  Dean and Sam's relationship has become layered and, as it is really a story about the bond of the two brothers, becomes the dramatic center of the show.  Replacing the ""monster of the week"" format of season one is an over-arching story that develops throughout the season.  Even standalone episodes contribute to the main story of the season.  If the high level of continuity maintained in this series is enough to get the horror/fantasy fan in you to get all sweaty, get this.  The mythology is expanded and strengthened.  The black and white, good and evil of demons/humans gets thrown into that grey area we're all so interested in.  The comedy--again, very Buffy-esque--is amped up, including many laugh-out-loud moments.  The battle between the two brothers and the forces of evil becomes way more epic and also more tragic.All of this comes to a head in the two-part season finale, which is--as I mentioned above--a moment of television perfection.  I haven't been so euphoric about serialized television since the moment Joss Whedon'sAngel - Complete Series Collector's Setcame to an end in 2004.Along withHeroes - Season OneandVeronica Mars - The Complete Third Season, the second chapter in Dean and Sam's journey was among the best of the Fall 06-Spring 07 television season.9/10"
Great show.  I got into it late but now I am a super fan.  Too bad they have had some really bad recent seasons (8 & 9)
"This season is basiclly the exact same as with the first season. Only differences are different characters, different creatures, a couple more story arches start recurring and a couple big story arches are resolved. This season also has the same flaws as the first, it seemed to posess a crazy amount of hot girls and some of the dialogue between Sam and Dean got repetitive. Still enjoyed the suspense, the laughs, the mythology and the action. A good viewing."
"Yes, the two leads are handsome and they may attract young female viewers.  But this is not some beefcake sitcom. This is Supernatural, a very dark and often gloomy story of two brothers who cannot live a normal life because they must carry on their father's legacy of demon-hunting.  This has dogged them since they were young and watched their own  mother die from a demon attack.What complicates matters is that the younger brother, Sam, has some psychic abilities which sometimes put him at risk.  Their father even told Dean that he might someday have to kill Sam to save him from himself and to protect others.  This leaves Dean with a sense of anxiety that never lets go.What I really like is that many episodes do not have some happy resolution; instead, the two brothers are left brooding on the life they are forced to live and the complications of their relationship and knowledge of each other.  No wife or kids for these guys; they are stuck on an endless road trip, running from harm or trying to destroy demons before they attack someone else.There are occasional lighthearted moments for comic relief--thank goodness.Think of this as a cross between Buffy and the X-Files. In fact, many XF writers and producers now work on this show, and it has the same foreboding atmosphere and music."
"I just couldn't wait to watch it, I don't know, when I saw couple of episodes on TV I was like ""nothing special"", but when I decided to give it a shot and start from the beggining....LOL I just fell in love with it. So after 2 seasons I was completly addicted to it. Season 3 is as funny as previous ones, lots of my favourite characters (of course Logan and Veronica:)) I also liked the previev episode of season 4..but I don't know if the season 4 was actually made or if the series was already cancelled:(( What a schame it would be, really great thing to watch:))I enjoy getting new dvd's to my collection like Veronica enjoys the thought about getting a PONY:)))I think this caracter is very funny-I WONT MORE VERONICA MARS PLEASE !!!! Whoever is in charge PLS!!!"
"This was such a wonderful series. The acting was so superb. Why do series get cancelled and the trash stays on? I will never understand, but thanks to Amazon.com, I have streamed and watched every episode and will probably watch again. Yes, I know there will be a movie out next month, but that is just not the same is it? Better than nothing maybe, but this series was cancelled with so many open questions. Like ending in the middle of a sentence. It neve should have been cancelled. Such a waste."
"After all the fuss with the film, I couldn't wait to check out what the show was all about. I'm addicted! I can't believe they ever canceled this show."
Loved this series.  We were so into watching that we had a hard time stopping.  We watched the total season one episode after another until we finished it.  Great season.
I just enjoyed it..it was always a well written script a good mystery andthe relationships were real. good job!
We began watching Veronica Mars because it was recommended. Glad we did watch - loved the characters and the fact that they kept showing up. Dick Casablacas was a character who was difficult to like - just shows what a good actor Ryan Hansen is. I hope they keep making more Veronica Mars...
"I love this show, I can't believe it only lasted 3 seasons. The main character is only a teenager but is very savvy!"
"Okay, I got &#34;hooked&#34; in amazon.com prime viewing Veronica Mars 10 years after this program first aired, and in the interest of those who were and are like me, late to the program, I won't provide spoilers. That being said, I'm really so into this major plot line that I did jump ahead to the grand finale, and now I am watching all the 2nd and 3rd seasons the way one eats popcorn or salted peanuts--I hate having to stop watching and go on to real life. I find that no matter what episode I watch, there is a great deal of continuity of story line, characters that Veronica's sleuthing bring to life, and there is such genuine warmth between the father-daughter pair that make this series worth the time and trouble to watch. You could label me the &#34;mountain girl who finally had time to see old TV shows worth saving&#34;, oh but perhaps too trite. Anyway, what keeps me into this story is the completeness of every episode, and the way the final episode wraps up the characters very nicely. It keeps you guessing right to the end, no matter how many mysteries you've see on TV or in the movies. Sorry that this is one for the history books. Well written and acted."
"Well, now I know what all the hype was about and why they are making a movie. Because the series was cancelled suddenly with NO ENDING!!! How dumb are these TV execs to cancel a show without allowing an ending? I must see the movie when it comes out so I know how it ends. Kudos to Kristen Bell and the guy who plays her dad (can't pronounce or spell his name) and all the friends and boyfriends. I hope we get to see all these characters again soon!"
"My wife & I remember this series when it was on TV, but we did not pay it much attention. The teen-love-triangle-high-school-drama had been playing itself too much. However, recently, while being on bed rest for a few weeks & coincidentally seeing the new movie previews; I was intrigued by the hype. Then I decided to give it a try. (We are Amazon Prime Members & I saw it each time I logged in to watch a streaming show) It was better than we expected! It genuinely delivered - Veronica (Kristen Bell) sublimating her grief & pain into finding her best friends murderer, while helping her dad & fellow high school students with individualized cases - after they had all abandoned her due to the events of her father, then the sherif of Neptune, suffering at the hands of the wealthy, powerful parents. The stories, the filming, the writing was very good! We were completely addicted to the show and watched it until it came to the final episode. Yes, it had it's cheese & some Episodes did not quite hold true; it was still a very good series, launched many young Hollywood actors & actresses as well as showing up some faces of previous young Hollywood actors/actresses now playing adult parents to this generation. We will be seeing the movie this weekend-now that I'm off bed rest! (Can one be a Marshmellow in post-haste?)"
Always loved watching this series.  Also watched latest Veronica Mars movie - it was great.
"I absolutely loved this show. I see it has been listed as a cult thing and I'm not sure what that means. I'm a very senior Senior so my interest may be surprising but I had a hard time doing anything else until I'd finished watching the last episode. All the good things said about this series are true--I was just very disappointed to learn that it was ending with this season. I have recommended it highly to several friends, but haven't heard their feedback yet. What a gem!"
"This is entertaining for both young teenagers and up through older adults - probably kids too. I tries it out and was soon sucked in by the excellent character actors, most of all Veronica. each epidode has multiple plots and sometimes there are great 2 episode stories. Everything links back to an overall plot to keep you interested."
"Couldn't think of a thing.  It is too bad the show ended after 3 seasons.  Just watched the VM Movie.  It was just enough to tie up some loose ends, but opened up new mysteries that I suspect will remain just that...mysteries.  The very last episode was really depressing.  Keith's roll especially was sad.  Always the bridesmaid; never the bride was wearing a bit thin.That being said; I loved it anyway.  Logan and Veronica - epic saga, spanning vast continents...to paraphrase LoVe.  If you haven't watched this series it is so sweet, sad, cleaver, romantic, mysterious and wonderful.  Yep, I'm hooked and got my hubby to watch all 3 seasons and the movie.  We have grand kids, so it is fun for all ages.  Ah, to be young again.  Not!  Just kidding.  Watching VM made me remember why I was glad to graduate HS and never looked back.  It is painful being a teenager and this series was a reminder (fictional though it is) how vulnerable and at risk they can be.  Food for thought."
"Although I am not completely through season, I have enjoyed the eleven episodes I ave watch.  I paused to was the movie version that was real eased in early March and to go on my trip to St Louis, Mo.  But I do plan to resume binging on Veronica Mars to complete season three.  I have thoroughly enjoyed this show and thank Amazon for making it possible.  The cast, including guests performed superbly and made the show a legend within its rights."
"I think it follows the quality of the other 2 seasons without falling in to the &#34;same old&#34; trap.  It stays exciting but ends expecting another season, which as far as I know does not happen.  There is a movie I have not watched yet,  hoping that is as good as the series.  I have enjoyed the series enough to go explore what other movies/shows they have done."
"We came into the seasons after they were over on the TV, but thought all three seasons were well written, entertaining, and fun.  It was easy to get attached to the characters and were glad we could watch two at a time because you are often left with cliff hangers.  Sadly, the end of this season left us with a major cliff hanger that will not be resolved until hopefully the movie coming out does.  That was my only complaint.  There should have been more seasons following this one."
The third season was as good as the previous two.  All and all it was a good series from beginning to end.
"I had never watched this show before and came across it. I was so sad to find out that after season three, the show got canceled. To make matters worse, season 3 ended with a huge cliffhanger. It was a great show and worth keeping."
Yet the writing is superb. Characters are interesting. Story arcs are involved and the cast was spot on for the most part. I fired through three seasons in a month. Very unfortunate about the abrupt ending while we are on our 20th season and spinoff of the Jersey Shore.
"Love Love LoVe Veronica Mars! I won't spoil it for you--but there are a lot of new adventures in store for the VMars crew. And the intrigue, wit, and repartee are still cery much intact. The only thing I was bummed about was the remixed tgeme song."
"This show was fabulous and I highly recommend it for those who love mystery and action and strong, smart leading female characters!"
"So glad the fans stayed on them to make a movie, which I did watch as well. The actors are great, the stories as well. I hope they make another movie in a couple years to catch us up with them again."
"I am disappointed that this show ended after only three seasons.  I love all the characters, especially Veronica's father, played by Enrico Colantoni.  I'll definitely see the movie and hope it resolves all the issues left hanging by the early demise of the show."
"This season continues to please with it's twists & turns. When characters behaving predictably, it is believably so. The last episode clearly shows that the season ended and the producers pulled the plug without completing the story line, leaving the audience wondering what happens next?  Or what happens to conclude the story line?  Maybe the moving coming out in March will pick up the thread. However I hope to see some of the same characters. We have a girls night out planned for it."
Love the characters; the way it ends was traumatizing.
I love the Nancy Drew style of this show. A twist to most Private Eyes by having a teenager solving what seems to be real crime on a teenager level. Learning from her private eye dad.. and seemingly real life situations on a college campus.
"I just wrapped up viewing the last of the Veronica Mars TV shows.  Had to get through all three seasons before watching the new VM movie.  Next to Firefly (another too soon canceled TV show), Veronica Mars is the best thing I've watched in a long time.  Highly recommended.  Great acting, superb writing, excellent &#34;snarkiness&#34; to keep things entertaining and moving along.  I have to say that they actually did a pretty good job of wrapping up entire season with the last episode."
this season of veronica mars was thriling it always keept me on edge and always wonting to watch the next episode there is only one thing that i did not like and that was the the season ended and there is no season 4 to go on that is the only thing that i did not like.
"I have been a big fan of veronica mars for a very long time! I'm not that old, but I have been watching since season 1, and I think that after I'm finished watching season 3, I'm going to watch it all over from the beginning! I've always been a big fan of detective shows. I also watch bones and CSI and so on. I would recommend this show to anyone who likes detective shows."
My husband and I love this show. Too bad it was only 3 seasons.  But I hear there is a movie coming out.
"This was interesting for the series to go from High School to college.  Most of the cast remains and Veronica is on the case again.  The sizzling romance with Logan is rekindled .  The college scene is somewhat believable, but I thought needed a little bit more work.  The last scene was a heartbreaker."
The shows writers are excellent.  I like the whole cast of characters.  It's funand it has good contemporary stories.
"love the series.  well written, well acted, and excellant all around.  would like to see the series continued.  thumbs up"
This was a cool series 3 - Veronica Mars.  I learned to like the characters after season 1 had ended and that's when this series got good. I gave it 5 stars because the show came together so well.  KRISTEN BELL is charming as a modern day Nancy Drew mistery solver.
I love this show.  Wish there were more seasons.  They left it open ended!  Very excited about the upcoming movie!
Loved it. loved it. loved it.  Can't think of anything negative to say about this episode I purchased from Amazon.
Loved it from beginning to end.  And the movie was the ending I was looking for.  tough stories lines but told in a light mood.
"You must watch all three seasons.A television show that actually deals with classism, racism and sexism.Smart, sarcastic and entertaining."
"Season Three of ""Veronica Mars"" is often panned by critics and fans alike.  I start my review on that note not because I plan to dispel claims of a decrease in quality (creator Rob Thomas addresses these issues on the special features without dismissing them) but to let the fans of ""Veronica Mars"" know that they have absolutely nothing to worry about.  This is classic V. Mars.Veronica Mars, a show very centered on the high school setting, easily survives something that has killed countless shows:  The shift to college.  Hearst College is a great new location for the majority of the action of the series, giving us many new and interesting sets and a variety of new characters.  Though the show may suffer from too much focus on said new characters (namely Piz, a true tool) instead of established favorites (Wallace catches it the worst here), the lost points are gained back by the strength of the series.  Kristen Bell consistently giving a stellar performance as the titular Veronica.  Usually--I know this is true for a lot of people--the most captivating characters are the supporting ones.  However, Veronica is simply the best character the series has to offer and that's saying a lot, as the characterization in this series is almost always flawless.  With characters like Logan, Keith Mars, Dick Casablancas, Wallace, and Weevil, one can't go wrong.Changes were made (due to pressure from the Network), most notably the shift of the usual format of a season-long arc carried out through mostly standalone episodes to a very different kind of set up.  The season is instead divided into three different mystery arcs.  The first few episodes focus on a rapist on the Hearst campus, the next revolving around a classic whodunnit murder mystery, and the final five episodes (the weakest of the series) are essentially standalones.  They function well enough as standalones, but the strength of the series has always been in it's story arcs.Another plus about this season is the fact that Disc Six is packed with previews.  We get the never-before-seen pitch for what Season Four of Veronica Mars would have been (which never came to fruition, thanks to the idiocy of television executive Les Moonves) and more extras than you will know what to do with.  It is truly a shame that this intelligent series was cancelled, as it was easily one of the best shows I have ever seen.9/10"
Veronica Mars is the new Nancy Drew 21st century style. Action packed and lots of fun too.Will wait for more.
This was one of the best series I've ever watched. Loved Veronica with her kickass attitude. Wish the series had continued with her going into the FBI.
"First off, start with season1.  It'll mean more if you watch them in order.  Season 2 was a little random for me, but I really liked the way they pushed it forward with Season 3 (in college).  We are all looking forward to the Veronica Mars Movie next year! (thanks to a GREAT Kickstarter campaign--the fans have spoken and we want more!!)"
"This review comes from a 75 year old female. I HATED to see the shows end. All the actors were excellent. It was so different and couldn't wait to see the next serial. They don't make good shows any more, just murder and horror ones. What has happen to all the good writers?"
Good show.  Wish there had been more seasons.  It is definitely worth watching if you like detective shows.  Also watch the other two seasons.
I enjoyed all three seasons of V. Mars.Sad to say: season three was the lastseason but the movie:Veronica Mars opens March 2014.
"Warning!  Spoilers littered throughout this review!Note:  I'll rewrite the following paragraph soon (pressing matters keeps me from doing more right now) but we now know from reliable sources that Veronica is not going to be back in any way.  She will not be back as a college student and she will not be back as an FBI agent in a reworked format.  The only reason the CW hasn't already made the announcement, according to Kristin of Eonline.com, is that they are afraid of the anger fans will heap on them.  They will deserve that anger!  For me the CW will always be the network that made room for a mother-daughter beauty pageant, a second season of the Pussycat Doll show, and THE FARMER TAKES A WIFE.  It had room for absolutely miserable excuses for shows like these, but couldn't find room on its schedule for VERONICA MARS.  That pretty much tells you all you need to know about the CW.I will revise this first paragraph as soon as we know for certain, but it is not true, as has been almost universally reported, that VERONICA MARS has been cancelled.  As of today this is what we know for certain:  it has not yet been placed on the fall schedule.  The head of the CW, Dawn Ostroff, says that while the VERONICA MARS of the past three seasons is gone, she is working with Rob Thomas and Kristen Bell on a possible future project, which most believe means the widely reported successor series to VERONICA MARS, in which the plot would shoot to the future, to deal with Veronica Mars as a FBI agent.  This would be accompanied with a completely new supporting cast and perhaps even a title change in the show.  Numerous sources have reported and Dawn Ostroff herself has stated that she has until June 15, 2007 to make a decision on whether to pick this new series up.  To be honest, not many insiders are offering fans much hope that this series will be picked up.  But as the old expression goes, ""The opera ain't over until the fat lady sings.""  Well, she isn't singing yet, but she might be warming up.  We'll have to keep our fingers crossed that the next three weeks will bring some good news.Certainly we need not fear for the long term future of Kristen Bell.  One of the most talented actresses on TV, she is not only lovely but a gifted actress, singer, and dancer all in one diminutive package.  The question is not whether she will be involved in some project in the future, but which one.  Most immediately it appears that she will be the narrator for GOSSIP GIRL (this might not happen if she plays VERONICA MARS in some way, but even if she does, it might be possible for her to serve as narrator--she did do the narration for the pilot that critics saw at the Upfront in New York).If VERONICA MARS is cancelled and we see no more of our pint-sized but large-spirited teen detective, we can, in a way, be grateful that we got three full seasons.  I fell in love with this show immediately and watched it religiously through its entire run.  When UPN inexplicably scheduled it opposite one of my other favorite shows, LOST, I recorded LOST and watched VERONICA MARS live.  Veronica was when she debuted the latest in a string of strong female characters to have arisen in the wake of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER making TV safe for such creatures.  She was, in fact, the heroine who most resembled Buffy.  The first two seasons were simply glorious, two utterly perfect seasons that topped almost everything else on television.  Season Three, unfortunately, represented something of a slip for the show.  (I refuse it give it less than five stars, however, simply because it was still better than most else on television.)  Many people have felt this and have speculated on why.  My own belief is that VERONICA MARS suffered from network interference.  Both Season One and Season Two were driven by deep emotional needs in Veronica to solve major mysteries.  Season Three had no such deep mystery (though there were two lesser ones) and as a result lacked the emotional intensity of the previous seasons.  No doubt a lot of this was the result of the network putting pressure on the show to make it accessible to new viewers.  We've seen this take place again and again over the years with various shows and the brute fact is:  it doesn't work.  Mainly such an approach wins no new viewers and alienates many of the viewers the show already has.  I spent all of Season Three with a mild feeling of disappointment, yearning for the intensity to return.  Yet, sometimes it did.  ""Spit and Eggs,"" which resolved the campus rape mystery, was as stressful and as wonderful as the best Season One and Two episodes, but it turned out to be the exception and the rules.My own thinking on the ""how to win new fans"" issue with series is that watering down the show never works.  Instead, I think the way to go is to rely on online streaming and DVD to get potential fans caught up.  I didn't, for instance, start watching FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS last fall when it debuted.  But I was able to catch up by watching it on NBC.com.  The CW put up a few episodes for streaming, but only a few.  What they needed to do was place the entire season online for its shows, much like NBC does.  Serial dramas like VERONICA MARS can attract and build up a fanatically devoted fanbase, but you keep that fanbase by continuing to produce a high quality serial drama, not by forcing it to become more and more episodic.  The truth is that networks almost always complicate rather than improve a series through their meddling.Another perplexing problem with Season Three was the near disappearance of several supporting characters.  At times I wondered if Wallace was still part of the show.  And Weevil played less and less of a role as the season went along.  My understanding is that Francis Capra, who plays Weevil, had some health problems during the season (and that medication he was taking led to a rather startling weight gain early in the year with accompanying skin problems--these seem to be on the way to clearing up by season end).  Mac became an opening credits character, but she didn't seem to play any more important role than she had in the past.Still, some things remained really great about the show.  Veronica and her father continued to have one of the most satisfying, if not the most satisfying, father-daughter relationship on TV.  Veronica continued to impress and overwhelm all those disposed to doubt her.  And as a huge BATTLESTAR GALACTICA fan she made the best frakkin' BSG references on all TV (though Dwight Schruette of THE OFFICE and Seth Cohen of THE O.C. gave her a run for her money), even helping one client find a woman she met at the BSG session at Comicon.  But a lot of the passion of the previous years was gone.  TV critics noticed.  For its first two seasons, VERONICA MARS was probably one of the five most critically praised shows on TV.  In Season Three it probably dropped out of the top ten to somewhere in the 10-15 spot.  I blame this entirely on network interference.The most heartbreaking part of the season came with the finale, which left several plot lines unresolved.  This was not entirely the network's fault.  Rob Thomas obstinately refused to do a ""just in case"" ending for the season.  He apparently wanted to increase the pressure on the network to renew the show.  That is one philosophy, but I prefer Joss Whedon's when he was on BUFFY.  His idea was that you never knew whether you would get cancelled (fortunately BUFFY never did, though both ANGEL and FIREFLY would be), so you leave the end of each season in a place where it could both lead into something if you get renewed, but it would be satisfying to the fans if you don't.  EVERWOOD filmed two versions of its Season Three finale in case it didn't get renewed.  It didn't, but thankfully a finale existed that wrapped up the show  Now, unless the FBI Agent Veronica Mars series materializes, we are left with a dangling show.  Moreover, it will dangle most likely regardless, since a time shift to several years in the future will take the show well past the subsequent events on the show.  Networks should do a better job of ending serial drams with dedicated fanbases, but the executive producers need to take some responsibility as well.  I can understand Rob Thomas's reluctance to not go gentle into that good night, but I wish he had filmed an episode that did a better job of wrapping up the series.  As it is, we are left wondering whether the homicidal nutjob Logan beat up got his revenge, whether Jake Kane was once again a part of the show's story, and whether Vinnie Van Low was the new sheriff of Neptune.Television is going to miss this show.  Although NBC debuts THE BIONIC WOMAN in the fall of 2007 (with a crackerjack production staff, a strong cast, and some very good writers, making this look like a more like one of the more promising series of 2007-2008), television is lacking somewhat right now in strong female characters.  In fact, only BATTLESTAR GALACTICA with characters like Laura Roslin, Sharon Agathon, and Starbuck has much in the way of strong women.  I'm delighted that we got to see Kristen Bell portray Veronica for three wonderful years, but I'm still going to miss her mightily."
I wish there was more.  Loved the series.On a side note Amazon's video quality seems to have improved from just a few months ago.  They need to work on their app for the Roku 3.
"Loved it! Sad to see it go! Love all the spins, performance by actors, and the storyline. Can't wait for the movie to be released!"
Another great season of a great show. Too bad it didn't last longer. I can't wait for the movie. Free to watch for Prime members.
"Crime and mystery in sunny California.  Overall, the series is a great production; characters are well realized and believable story line.  I've watched the episodes a couple of times and it holds up fairly well though Season 1 dates to Sep 2004."
"This series is a classic. It can't be duplicated. No matter what Kristen Bell does, she will never surpassthis series."
I loved all 3 seasons of Veronica. This one leaves you a bit hanging. Excited for the movie. Hoping it will wrap everything all up
The third season ended after 20 episodes. In Previous years there were 22 episodes.In the last episode (20) of season three there were to many story lines that needed to come  to a conclusion.Does anyone know how the story lines ended up - Election of Sheriff Etc.Looking forward to the movie coming out in 2014.
I never watched this show when it was broadcast and I'm glad I didn't because I wouldn't have been able to handle the wait between weeks and seasons. Binge watching this show made it much more enjoyable and I can't wait for the movie because the way the show was cancelled in the middle of a season was a travesty. WATCH IT!
"Is it possible?  I love this character!  Maybe because of my childhood fascination with Nancy Drew and this is her come to life in the modern age, maybe because this is the chic I wish I were with the feisty and the smarts and the always getting her man (or lady criminal).  I don't know, all I can say is yes, thank you, more please!  Thrilled for the movie and I really hope we can get a new movie every couple of years, even made for TV.  Keep Veronica Mars alive!"
Turned in to marshmellow! Love this show. Wish it had lasted more seasons. Hope that with the movies's success they will restart the seasons
"I've watched all 3 seasons, this is one of the best series I've seen lately. It's to bad that it ended in 2007. I'm curious as to why it ended, somehow the networks always end a good series and replace it with something that flops in a few weeks.Enjoyed it and highly recommend it."
Lots to chew on and enjoy whether you were already familiar with these characters or not.  Nice flow to the plotline.  I enjoyed it very much. The writer made her mother's addictive personality an unavoidable inheritance of Veronica's.  Will our heroine embrace this trait as a weakness that she will always fall prey to or will she find a way to make it a strength? This was the consistent psychological thread that deepened the murder mystery and gave the audience a super meaningful connection to Veronica Mars.  All of the characters from her childhood were grappling with a question: to what extent are we unable to throw off genetic proclivities and childhood traumas and other cultural influences in order to walk our own path in life?
"I have to confess after the series opening presentation I never really watched the rest of the series.This was probably made to placate the devoted series watchers that found their programs cut off. Many different series ether just stop or have a pansy wrap up for the last episode. If we are lucky as with ""Veronica Mars"" we are treated to a full length movie that tries to incorporate the essence of the series. With Star Trek there was a series of movies. We can only hope so here.Veronica was a teenage private eye. Now older and supposedly wiser on the verge of getting a cushy law firm job, she is called back home to help pick a lawyer to defend an old boyfriend. He was accused of murdering one of her old classmates. Naturally as we would've suspected she gets sucked into trying to track down the culprit(s) herself. Will she give up the cushy job and her new boyfriend and a new life just to save her old boyfriend and possibly cleanup the local law enforcement at the same time?If you seen one of these ""let's find culprit as the only way to vindicate the suspect"" stories that you see most of them. The worth in this particular movie is that it has the formula and the characters that we've all come to identify with in the series. This film also gives hope that there might be a series of films."
"This was a good story as follow up to the seasons of VM. I liked the story and was glad that many loose ends were tied up. I always follow a series and when it stops it is irritating that all the unanswered questions remain. Not so here. Love the character of Veronica Mars, just the right balance."
I have missed Veronica Mars so much. It was so sad to see it leave the airwaves after 3 seasons. Seeing this movie was as if it never left.
"I am fairly certain that when Rob Thomas was developing Veronica Mars over 10 years ago that I was not the demographic he was shooting for.  Well, call me Mr. Staypuff because I'm a genuine ""marshmallow"" fan of this show.  Growing up I was a big reader and quickly ran through all the Tom Swift and Hardy Boys books published.  My next door neighbors were three sisters who had the entire Nancy Drew library which I also read and enjoyed.  Maybe this is why I love this series-  and now this movie.  The characters reunited in another mystery was a lot of fun.  I think the success of the Kickstarter campaign to fund this film starts with Kristin Bell, she totally sells this character and owns it.  Pretty, smart, and sassy she's very entertaining and compelling to watch. A contemporary, darker Nancy Drew strikes just the right note and is credible.  The support cast of largely unknown actors work well together and the sprinkling of known actor guest stars are blended well into the stories.  Of special mention is Enrico Colantoni as Veronica's dad, P.I. and former sherriff Keith Mars.  I only know him from his work on ""Just Shoot Me"" which was a comedic role but he's perfect as Veronica's father.  My only frustration with the series was the seemingly endless poor relationship choices Veronica makes for such an intelligent young woman. That said I was never a team Piz fan and guess her serial boyfriend Logan works the best.  I think this movie gives fans some closure since at the conclusion of season 3 Rob Thomas and company did not know if they'd been renewed or not.  For some critics of the updated presentation, and one who picks on Kristin Bell for essentially not being as ""hot"" as she was 10 years ago and looking like she just had a baby (which she did) all I have to say is don't attend your high school reunion dude, you're going to be disappointed!  Do I here sequel?"
"I did not get in to the TV series until just recently and then only because it was a free show to watch due to me being part of PRIME.  Well I got hooked.  LOL the movie just increases the hooked that caught me.  I am not sure how it is doing in the theaters and was not able to watch it at a theater....FOR SHAME.....but I did purchase the movie with Amazon before it was released.....see told ya I was hooked.....I will not spoil the fun for anyone who has et to view this movie; but will say that if you miss it....whether or not you are a fan of Veronica Mar TV series, then you are missing a really great movie......and no you do not have to watch the series in order to understand the movie and the past lives of the characters; but hey after watching the movie you may want to delve in to the old series.  Now then one item......told ya I was hooked after watching a bit of the series......another word for hooked is ADDICT.......there is more than addiction to drugs....or to alcohol.....there can be various addictions and being addicted to fantastic story lines in TV series and movies is not truly a bad addiction.....LOL that is unless you are not able to receive regular feedings for that addiction and I am hoping that this will not be the first and only return of Veronica Mars, for that would mean that the producers and writers and directors and actors are NOT feeding us poor addicts to the ongoing adventures that the marshmallow Veronica Mars can delight in."
They did a good job recreating the show.  I am glad to have just got in through Amazon since not sure what a movie screen would have done..  Obviously sets up a possible 2nd movie depending on how much it makes.
"Loved the show. I missed a few episodes so I binge-watched the entire series before watching the movie.It was what I hoped-it did not disappoint. I am not as hypercritical about every detail. I just like the characters, miss them and was glad to see all (missed one) in the movie.If you even remotely enjoyed VM before, rewatch it all and rent this-it wil not disappoint!!!!"
Always love the series and this movie was great.  Hope there is more coming.  Kristen Bell is wonderful in this series.
"From the trailers, I had very low expectations. This film far exceeded those. I had to get used to the style of this movie in that Veronica narrated it, her texts would appear almost as 'bubbles' on the screen from time to time and there were a lot of characters I did not know from the tv series, which I have seen but a long time ago and didn't remember all of them. No matter. I quickly adapted to these and instead enjoyed the mystery.The film corrected one thing and this is a SPOILER. At the beginning of the film she is with a guy and they were an item but it was very clear to me they had no real chemistry. It was with Logan you instantly saw the chemistry. Well, enough said on that.Kristen Bell is outstanding in the lead and I liked everyone in this film.It is beautifully shot, too. I was very impressed with the overall look of the film. Someone called it 'low budget'? Don't believe it. You won't find a ton of CGI shots but if that is your idea of low budget then you need to expand your horizons.Nice music, too.I am hoping they make more Veronica Mars films."
"Loved the movie! I was willing to pay the higher rental fee simply because fan funding brought the movie to us. The script was well written, the acting was well executed, and I enjoyed seeing everyone back playing these roles."
"This, to be frank, will not be a very critical post. To my shame, for I am a manly man, I am one of them, whatchamacallit, ""marshmallows,"" a devotee of the late, lamented series, Veronica Mars. This silver screen resurrection was such a damn longshot... How the movie came about says something about the emergence of social media as a determining factor in the film industry. Freakin' yay for the Kickstarter campaign and its 91,585 backers and the shattered records, including that it met its $2 million goal in the first day of the campaign and went on to triple the thing at $5.7 million. The behind-the-scenes story is so feel good. Veronica Mars, the movie, is essentially a love letter from the cast & crew to the fans.A long time ago, we used to be friendsBut I haven't thought of you lately at all...It's been roughly ten years since we last saw Veronica, back when she was a teenaged private eye poking her nose in everyone's biz in Neptune, Cali. The movie's opening sequence fills us in on what she's been up to. Veronica is interviewing for a place in a prestigious New York law firm that especializes in dumping frivolous cases before they get to court. (So much for what would've been the 4th Season premise of her landing in the FBI.) Veronica confides that she got out of Neptune when she was 19, got herself a B.A. in psychology at Stanford, was near the top of her class in Columbia law. Interview over, Veronica hopes for the best.She claims that her amateur sleuthing days are in the rear view and her nosy disposition tamped down. And when her bad boy ex Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) is implicated in murder and he calls her, pleading for her help, she assures her current beau that she's only going to provide Logan with lawyery advise. So it's back home for Veronica, a reunion with her ex with the baggage and a dive back into a posh but then scuzzy space redolent of leftover angst and reputations ruined and inner demons outed but never exorcised. That unknown murderer lurking in the midst - because it can't possibly be Logan, right? - almost seems a footnote. Just another day in Neptune.The best bits about the television show get reincarnated. It's still ultimately about the underdog, the perceived loser, putting one over the bullies. Very much intact is that marvelous father-daughter synergy between Kristen Bell and the fantastic Enrico Colantoni. Veronica and Logan's relationship is still... complicated. Veronica still cracks wise. She's still incredibly dogged. There's huge gratification in catching up with a host of familiar faces. Everyone came back! Plus, there's a surprise cameo or three. Okay, if you don't know Veronica Mars from Bruno Mars, you won't get it. But this isn't about luring in the uninitiated. See, you've caught me in mid-celebration. I'm still gobsmacked that there's a Veronica Mars movie, and I think we marshmallows suspected it wasn't gonna make tons of money, but so what? Maybe tomorrow I'll watch this again and then I'll notice flaws. But that's tomorrow. This movie is a collaborative labor of love among the filmmakers, the cast, and the ardent, mobilized fans. For now, I'm keeping it on the pedestal.The DVD's bonus stuff:- ""By the Fans: The Making of the Veronica Mars Movie"" - a very cool documentary in which Rob thomas, Kristen Bell and the entire Veronica Mars cast take you from its record-breaking Kickstarter launch to pre-production to the first day on set and beyond! Includes a segment from the backers' perspectives as they show up as extras on the set (00:55:36 minutes long)"
"I was soooooo very excited once I found out about this movie, because I was completely bummed when the series ended.  The movie is awesome!  Again...  I found myself sad as the ending approached because I knew it would finally be over.  Farewell Veronica Mars...  you will be missed."
"I've said it before and I'll say it again; Why did this show get canceled? I was THRILLED when I found out there was going to be a movie, but now that I've just watched it, I NEED MORE! I am excited about the books coming out, but that's just not going to cut it. This show needs to return. I loved seeing all the old characters and Veronica's sass. Cannot say enough good things about this show."
"As good if not better than Covert Affairs or Person of Interest  and Rizzoli & Iyles but with far more interesting characters and storylines. Strikes a nice balance between mystery and humor and the frustrations of love. The Networks are too busy with reality tv CW, Netflix, Amazon HULU make this happen. One refreshing note among many, how realistic to see Logan put his hand on the wall when they we r e going to kiss after he embraced her. Instead of the usual &#34;slam her head against the wall&#34; (Arrow). Not being familiar with the show, I robowatched the 3 seasons on Amazon Prime and then opted to purchase the movie on Instant Video to watch at my leisure. It's great to be able to buy a movie while it's in the theater."
"I was late to the Veronica Mars party, but was absolutely thrilled with the movie. I only wish there was more."
"Glad I watched the movie, though I was never a fan of Veronica Mars TV series. I'm a fan now, eager to see a second one.The acting is low-key but believable. I quickly forgot I was watching Kristen Bell. The detective action is believable, and has a high-octane finish."
If you were and still are a fan of this awesome series then the wait is over.  Your fix for more Veronica Mars will be satisfied and having all of the actors reprise their roles give me chills and made be giddy.  The fans spoke and acted by donating to Kickstarter to make this film a reality and to all of them I simply say...THANK YOU!!!I definitely want another movie!!!!
"I hope they continue to make more. The pace and acting is great, I also love the plot lines. They aren't the usual cookie cutter stories hollywood turns out, these actually have depth, the characters also have depth. Clearly the fans love it to put up the money to make it. Maybe now some smart producer/director/studio will see the wisdom of developing stories for Amazon. This is the first time I've heard of a film being made to order for fans, and I hope it's not the last."
"This would have been a great TV Movie.  My wife loved it.  My Kids and grandkids all want to see it.  The problem with that is there are 5 offensive words, some hand gestures and genital cartoons in the movie.  Of course I believe all the kids see worse than this at school.  I just don't want to be the one to give it to them to watch.  Leaves me in a bad position for a PG13 movie.  Why did Veronica have to grow up and have such a mouth.  I am in a bad spot because the movie was surprisingly good and had a fulfilling end to it.  I really didn't see it all coming down like it did.  Apologies to the director but I may edit it so I can show it to the kids."
"As a die hard V. Mars fan, the movie was everything I had waited years for.  The package arrived in a tmely manner, was in excellent shape and easy to open."
I am a big Veronica Mars fan and this movie with the extended characters from the TV show did not disappoint.
I loved the movie I think they did a really good job of tying up loose ends for those of us who were extremely sad the series ended.
We watched the series and was bummed that it didn't continue. We heard they were making a movie and glad that it released on dvd at the same time as the theaters.  The did a great job continuing the story and with a good ending.
I would watch it again. Funny moments that crack you up.
"wish they would bring back the series.  understand regretably all actors have gone onto better things.  bjut, i'm sure they could  find someone to fill the spots. i liked them 5 stars"
This movie is awesome!!  Veronica and Logan and their &#34;epic&#34; love story continues!  I wish the show would come back on the air!!  This great movie makes me hopeful for more :)
This is a great movie. I really wish the series would start up again. I LOVE all of these characters. The movie was interesting and kept me interested.
"It's not that we're soft, like &#34;marshmallows.&#34; It's more like we're addicts for the soft, sweet, heated up, treats that The Veronica Mars show dished out. We're more like raccoons. We can't get enough of that browned, white, semi burned, funky stuff. The movie delivered it. Dished it right up on a reminiscent platter on a brand new table. Yum! Feels as good as ever. And if we gotta dish out more Kick Starter Cash to get Movie Two&#8230; DON'T BE SURPRISED. We raccoons have a tendency to get what we crave, one way or the other. You Dig?"
"I couldn't believe when they said they were going to crowd source the funding for this movie. But they actually did it and then some. my wife and I have always loved the series, and couldn't believe that they stopped it like they did., a la deadwood, pushing daisies, Fire Fly etc. anyway we loved the movie, we didn't see it in the movie theater, but we have Amazon prime and were able to rent it for 4 bucks....What a great deal. They left the ending so it almost looks like they could do another movie, which would be great!"
"After this movie was over, I immediately pre ordered the novel that comes out next week on Amazon. I can't wait to dive back into the world of Veronica Mars. I wish Kristen Bell wasn't on House of Lies because this would be a perfect show for Amazon or Netflix to pick up."
"If you were a fan of the Veronica Mars series, you will love the movie. I love the way it was funded by fans too! I think the movie is even better than the series. It picks up Veronica's life several years after the series ended. The mystery is complicated and hard to solve. The decisions Veronica has to make are difficult life changing decisions. The acting was solid, the characters complex, and it looks like a much more expensive movie than it is. I hope they do a sequel."
"I loved the show and was continually surprised at the excellent writing. I thought this movie would be predictable, but even though there were some predictable parts, it still holds plenty of surprises.  I was blown away, and I hope there will be more movies in the future.  BIG kudos to the writers!!!!  I wish the show hadn't ended so soon."
I love this movie. We waited a long time for this to come out. My daughter and I watched it twice. It stayed true to the series and did not disappoint.
I loved the series when it was on and have rewatched it many times.  I saw it at the theaters and couldn't wait to own my own copy.  I have already watched it many times and love it.
"Veronica Mars has it all:  suspense, drama, romance, comedy, and action.  For us Marshmallows, it, seamlessly, took us to today's VM; and left us happy and anticipating a maybe-sequel - anything is possible, right?  Thoroughly enjoyed the movie and seeing my favorite characters again.  Outstanding!"
"It's been years since Veronica was in Neptune but her departure from New York as a recent law school graduate and promising law firm prospect was masterfully done.  Veronica finds her way back to Neptune to help Logan and ends up not only finding herself in the midst of a case that could potentially clear Logan's name for the murder of his high profile girlfriend but a mystery of the murder from the past.  The movie lives up to the three seasons of the show that saw the series end to soon.  One of the many casualties that resulted from the network changing from UPN to the WB to The CW network (i,e. Star Trek: Enterprise).  Both Veronica Mars and Enterprise series didn't die out because of a lack of viewership but the confusion of the changes of the networks.  If you were a fan of the show then you will love the Veronica Mars movie and will make you want to go back and revisit the series' three seasons.  I"
"If you love the tv series, you'll love this movie. The movie sticks to the light-hearted yet dark tone of the series and features the great character relationships and mysteries that made it so strong. Lots of bantering between Veronica and her dad especially. Don't spoil yourself by reading about it - just get it. love love love. Now I want another few years of a tv series."
"I had recently watched the series on Amazon and sound this movie did a wonderful job catching up on a series that was cancelled without time for an ending-with a few exceptions-you can only do so much in an hour and a half. It was like going to a reunion. Veronica's dialogue was witty as usual. I had read a review that stated this movie ending could lead to another sequel or perhaps to brining the series back. I vote for brining the series back with a grown-up VM and friends.Rob Thomas proved that a movie can be made well with a smaller budget.James Franco, Justin Long and Dax Shepard all have cameos-James' does a great job making fun of himself."
"I love me some Veronica Mars!  No, the movie does not give you all the same joy, anticipation and frenzied excitement as the TV show but it was a well done story of people who have moved into the next stages of life with all the decisions, dramas and regrets that can come along for the ride.  Throw in murder, intrigue, and a love affair for the ages...and you have one heck of a movie.  if you like film noir, suspense, and detective movies, check it out.Also, when you do, you support a movement. I believe that if we get a Veronica Mars movie every few years, they will just get better and better because the creator is committed to such excellence and has the vision.  Let's support it and keep the dream alive.  This has been a PSA brought to you by this one fan of Veronica Mars."
"I had mediocre expectations when I went to see this move, I just didn't want to get my hopes up for a fantastic movie and then have it be a let down. But I was extremely pleasantly surprised with the movie. It was well made, well filmed, gave us marshmallows the answers we've been dying for, and had some great suspense scenes. I was so happy that I made the commitment to this movie that I did, and can't wait to own it so I can watch it again and again!"
"Child's Play (Sidney Lumet, 1972)It is exactly thirty-eight minutes into Child's Play where the movie stops being a fuzzy, slow-moving mess and becomes something that actually seems like a Sidney Lumet film. The scene takes place in the chapel of the boys' school where the entire film is set. Robert Preston (The Music Man), who plays Joe Dobbs, the headmaster of the eleventh-grade class, an English teacher much-beloved of the school's pupils, is standing at the front of the chapel, facing the altar. In a pew a few rows behind him is Jerome Malley (A Touch of Larceny's James Mason), the headmaster of the senior class, who teaches Greek and Latin and, as a holdover from the days when corporal punishment was accepted in schools, still has the nickname ""Lash"". Dobbs delivers a monologue that sets up the entire rest of the film, at least the bits that haven't already been set up. And I can almost imagine Lumet, at the end of that scene, smacking his fist into his other palm, pointing at Mason and Beau Bridges, the other main actor in this movie, then pointing to Preston and yelling, ""THAT is the quality of acting I want to see from you idiots!""He gets it for the rest of the film.Plot: We open with Paul Reis (Bridges) as a senior at the school, on his way to see the headmaster, Father Mozian (They Might Be Giants' Ron Weyand), for the very, very serious infraction of drawing some obscene pictures on Malley's chalkboard. He's being escorted by freshman teacher Dobbs, who cautions young Reis that, while such actions may be amusing, they're not likely to get him anywhere in life. The camaraderie of the moment is shattered by one of the school's jocks lobbing a basketball at Reis' head--it would seem that Reis is what Jean Shepherd calls ""one of the nameless rabble of victims"" in A Christmas Story. Dobbs defuses the situation and everyone gets on with their lives. Fast-forward nine years. Reis is now a phys.ed. teacher who's sick of the public school system and has returned to his alma mater to take up a vacant position there. He and Dobbs pick up just where they left off, as great friends. Reis seems willing to bury the hatchet with Malley, but Malley is driven to distraction by his mother's imminent death, which he believes is being hastened by a series of anonymous, harrassing phone calls, and assaults on his own character (which include, but are not limited to, pornographic magazines being ordered in his name and sent to his home, as well as notes being passed by the students--it is never explicitly stated, but made obvious nonetheless, that all of this is homosexual in nature). We find out soon enough that Malley was supposed to retire at the beginning of the year, but refuses to do so because he is adamant that Dobbs not take over his job as senior headmaster; he considers the affable Dobbs not only unfit for the job, but in fact an agent of Satan himself (he believes Dobbs to be behind all the magazines, notes, calls, etc.). Reis walks into the middle of this, and while he's not explicitly tasked with choosing a side, his unexpected, and unlikely, ally Father Penny (King of the Gypsies' David Rounds in his first feature appearance), the oft-tipsy religion teacher, warns Reis that it's going to happen eventually, no matter how neutral he tries to stay. While this is the main conflict, there's also the ever-present bullying that, as we know, Reis is all too familiar with...but this class aren't just bullies, they're sadists; in the first act of bullying to which Reis is witness, by the time he manages to pull the children off, their target has damage severe enough that the hospital believes he may lose an eye. A second victim is mock-crucified, at which point Father Mozian is forced into considering whether to expel the culprits--which would, almost immediately, cause the school to shut down, as they comprise half the senior class (and thus, half the senior class' tuition). Assuming, of course, the authorities don't shutter it first.There is a great deal going on here, and the late Lumet manages to herd these cats very nicely once the movie finds its rhythm (which, admittedly, takes thirty-eight minutes). Mason, Preston, and Bridges, of course, were all known commodities by this time, and was there ever any question they were up to the material? As a simple portrait of the nasty goings-on at a boys' school, a generic slice-of-life drama, this would have been a damned good movie. But the final twenty minutes, which turn it into something very different indeed, take it from ""good"" to ""blow the lid off."" In the hands of a lesser director, or performed by lesser actors (and to be fair, there's a time or two where it seems like Bridges is about to slip over the line), this could have come off cheesy, if not unintentionally hilarious. But it is meant to be horrific, and it succeeds. This is tragedy of Greek proportions, with the school's gang of bullies functioning as the chorus of harridans, and had the first thirty-eight minutes been as taut and compelling as the final hour, this would be Lumet's second five-star film in my library (Dog Day Afternoon is the other). Even with that considered, this is another guaranteed slot in the top thousand for Mr. Lumet; the brilliance of the last sixty-two minutes downright overwhelms the unfocused, muzzy quality of the first thirty-eight. **** "
Many spooky moments ! Good storyline good acting ! James mason is excellent ! I would have bought it had it been available to do so ! Please put it up for sale soon amazon ! If you enjoy old horror you should watch this one !
"This is an excellent movie.  It is not the ""chucky"" horror flick, it is heavy duty drama which in its own way is a ""horror flick"".  The actors were excellent and the story good.  It's story that fringes on true horror. The evil intentions of one in authority manipulating the innocent towards the destruction of their own soul; by committing atrocious vile acts against others.  I gave this movie five stars for the extremely talented Actors, Director and Writer of this film. I had almost forgotten what a really good movie was..."
This is my favorite show.  I find it to be inspirational and moving along with being very funny.  Thank you for allowing me to watch it on your site.

I love My Name is Earl and all the kooky characters on this show. I thought I paid a great price for this season 2 of this funny show. I would recommend anyone in the world to get any season of this hilarious comedy show. I love this show! :)
Earl and his crew are great. Love the Karma thing. Each season gets better. Great gift idea. Each show the characters develop farther. Guest stars are great.
"I've never been the type of person to get excited over television.  I like my sitcoms because they're easy to follow, even if you miss a week, and reruns barely ever get old (I think I've seen every episode of `Friends' twelve times over), but aside from that I really can't say that the idea of following a shows premise all season long interests me.  It's easy for me to miss a week and then find myself lost and wondering what is going on.  There are really just a few shows I've watched religiously; `The Sopranos' being one, another being the early seasons of `Nip/Tuck' (I lost faith after the disastrous third season).Well, you can add `The Riches' (as well as `Damages') to that short list.  As we head further into season two I feel compelled to write my review of the first season before too much blurs together.Like I said, following a show all season long seems like a daunting task for me.  When that show sinks its claws into you and refuses to let go though, you find it much easier to plop down in front of the TV every Tuesday night.  That's how things went for me with `The Riches'.  After deciding the `Nip/Tuck' was so behind me I needed to find something to fill that void.  I happened to stumble onto a encore showing of the pilot for this new `provocative' show called `The Riches' and within the first few minutes I was hooked.  Watching this cute little girl con someone then turn around and reveal that he was a cute little boy was enough for me; I was in.The shows premise is that of a traveling family (modern day gypsies), the Malloy's.  Dahlia has just been released from prison and her husband Wayne and three kids (Di Di, Cael and Sam) have come to bring her home.  Dahlia has her own set of problems, most instigated from the time she's just finished serving, but when Wayne decides that the life of a traveler is just not for them anymore the Malloy's find themselves in a hole heap of trouble.  Segregated from the rest of their traveling family, which includes Dahlia's crazy cousin Dale, the Malloy's find themselves on the run for their lives.  When an unfortunate accident costs a young wealthy couple their lives Wayne and Dahlia see this as an opportunity to change the course of their lives.  Taking on the identity of Doug and Charlene Rich, the Malloy's are now living the `American Dream', but is it really all they could have hoped for.The show at times may stretch the boundaries of reality, but that is what makes it so much fun.  The writers are smart enough to make what on the outset may appear implausible seem completely doable.  Looking at the situations Wayne and Dahlia find themselves and the ways they purpose to survive them is enthralling and exciting beyond belief.  What's so great about `The Riches' is that it asks the viewer to really examine what makes them happy.  As Wayne tries to turn his families life around and create a more stable and `normal' environment for his children he ultimately finds himself sacrificing the morals he has already set for them, and while Dahlia tries to support her husband she finds that her life is becoming more and more miserable by being someone that she doesn't want to be.  The children also have to adjust and decide if they even want to pursue a `normal' life if it forces them to change who they are inside.The acting is superb here.  Eddie Izzard and Minnie Driver are phenomenal as Wayne and Dahlia Malloy.  Izzard has impeccable control and becomes the stability in the show, while Minnie steals every scene with her acting range and emotional temperance.  She conveys so much realism with her performance, it's captivating and touching.  All three actors who play the Malloy children are flawless.  Noel Fisher captures Cael's rebelliousness which is really nothing short of his outward display of disapproval with his parent's new lifestyle.  Aidan Mitchell is adorable as young Sam, the gender-bending son who can't seem to decide just who he really is.  But it is Shannon Woodard who really shines brightest here as Di Di, the smart and yet torn daughter who battles herself with their new life, wondering if it's perks outweigh it's disadvantages.Each episode is littered with superb supporting performances by Gregg Henry who plays Wayne's outlandish new boss as well as Margo Martindale who plays their nosey yet caring neighbor Nina.I can't think of a flaw here, at least not one large enough to deter anyone from enjoying the entire season.  Season two has now officially begun and is building strong on its first season so I truly only see good things to come at this point.  `The Riches' help make my Tuesday nights all that much more interesting and hopefully they can do the same for you.  Leave it to FX to create something new and exciting and completely worthwhile.  I may have just been conned out of my Tuesday evenings, but it was well, well worth it."
"It was this show that made me realize that the best programs were rarely on broadcast TV anymore.  FX has taken unique risks with their programming.  (Thanks forever, for giving Louie CK the room to do what he does best.  Rescue Me had scenes so heartbreaking, I could barely stand it.)The Riches is a great metaphor for looking at the American Dream through a cynical lens, unique in its kind of subtlety and suspense.  Eddie Izzard did great work, as did Minnie Driver.  What a culture clash--Travelers vs. Settlers.  Why did it end?  I'm so happy for the chance to go have another look at programming I miss.  With streaming video I can really say, there is no such thing as moaning, ""There is nothing on.""  Now, there really is, always something worth watching."
"I'm reviewing the season which I loved, Season One.  This season was so fresh and new in premise that I hung onto each episode.  It is great fun from first episode to last.  The premise is that Travelers (American gypsies or Roms) substitute themselves for people who were killed in a car crash.  They hid the bodies and then rolled into a moderate sized southern town as those people.  Since no one in the town knew them, they were able to pull this off.  The husband and father was a corporate lawyer and his wife was the perfectly tended 2nd wife.  The dead people had no children but they add on their 3 children to the mix.  These people have never lived in anything but an RV encampment and have lived on solely their wits for years.  They are expert con men, even the children.  Now they live in a gated community and must convince everyone in town that they belong.  It is always a near thing because, of course, they don't belong but they are excellent cons, both on a computer and off one. Wayne and Dahlia Malloy (Eddie Izzard and Minnie Driver) are the husband and wife and parents of this bunch.  Eddie Izzard is a very well known British comedian and thus he is perfect for playing a man who has to live by his wits and become someone he's not on a moment's notice.  Although everyone else is very good, Izzard is outstanding and it is impossible to picture the show without him.  Season Two just did not come together for me like Season One did but I kept watching because Izzard was still so good."
"What a great concept for a series.  Eddie and Minnie are marvelous together with true chemistry.The plot is well written and the story archs are delightful to watch unfold.Like the character traits themselves, you won't be able to watch just one at a time."
"Of all the show that I've watches lately, I must say that this is the best show today. I'm glad that I've own my own copy, so that I can always watch it over and over again."
"When I was a young man running my first rig in the Oil Fields in Kern county California, was having trouble with doing jobs faster than the other crews I worked with. One day the man who trained me pulled me aside and said ""You don't get it... They don't want good operators, they want good liars"".In this wonderfully written and acted series, Minnie Driver and Eddie Izzard test that theory, in the world of the upper class, by ""stealing the American dream"".  This series brings the public to a mostly unknown hidden culture in America of the Travelers (Irish Gypsies) which is something cool in a TV show, going so far out of the box of regular TV writing it's in another warehouse.If you want something very different, ""The Riches"" is a show for you."
"I thought this show was great.  The story was very original and entertaining.  I was sad to find that there are only 2 seasons because I could watch much more of this show!  It's got a little bit of everything - suspense, comedy, action and drama."
"Wow, I love this show.  There is suddenly a big influx of fun, original shows and this is one of them.  It's so cool and addictive and I'm hooked now.Minnie Driver is fantastic as Dahlia Malloy who is part of a family of con artists.  She is on parole from having served time in prison for petty robbery and larceny.  Her and her husband Wayne are now on the move with their three kids.  They're travelling in an RV when they are witness to a car crash, and making a long story short, they end up assuming the identities of a wealthy family, the Riches, and move to an upscale neighborhood in Palm Beach Florida.  Wayne needs to find work to support the family's new lifestyle so his first scam begins when he tries for a job with his neighbor at his law firm.I can't tell you in words just how good this is.  It's such a cool show that you have to check out for yourself.  It's fun and enjoyable and Minnie Driver is brilliant in here.  I love watching how these guys get away with all the things they do and it's certainly addictive.  Get yourself a copy and you'll have a new favourite show for sure."
"I loved the characters and concept. Always there was an intriguing cliff hanger that forced me to watch the next and then again, I was never bored. I just wish this never ended. Beware though - it's addictive."
"It wasn't what I at first expected, and actually was better than I hoped for.  It is entertaining to explore the concept of Travelers interacting with whatever they call everyone else...Take it for entertainment value, not a lesson about society and you will enjoy this series."
"This show has a wonderful story line that gets your hooked. I recommend giving the show a try, I think that you will enjoy it."
"The Riches is one of the most original series ever with characters who are complex and intriguing. Each episode holds you captive as Wayne (Eddie Izzard) and Dahlia Malloy (Minnie Driver) strive to impersonate the Rich family, an immense challenge with their lack of education and experience.This is a series where you never know what is going to happen next or how Wayne is going keep it all together but the love that Wayne and Dahlia have for each other and their children always help them to find a way.Izzard and Driver are simply eloquent. Noel Fisher (Cael), Shannon Marie Woodwood (DiDi) and Aidan Mitchel (Sam) are genuine in their roles as the three Malloy children.I can't wait for this to come out on dvd!"
"As my review title goes, this was a great show.  Originally I thought it would be a comedy, but it's more of a drama with a lot of irony.  Not your typical formula show, which is why it was so cool but also probably why it got cancelled (can anyone say &#34;Firefly&#34;?)."
"The group in question is the Travelers--a band of con artists who have apparently been in the U.S. since the 19th century.  This show offers a glimpse into their world, and how odd and sometimes difficult it is for them to try to live among the rest of us.  Eddie Izzard and Minnie Driver do some pretty decent American accents as the husband and wife posing as the Riches.Complications ensue as they attempt to fill the deceased Riches' shoes, working, living, and going to school among the so-called Buffers (non Travelers).  Never a dull moment, as they say."
"With almost every season of South Park you always have the odd one or two episodes that weren't really that good. Season 1 it was Weight Gain 4000, Season 2 it was Terrence & Phillip in not without my Anus and so on, as with all seasons although you have the bad episodes, you always have your personal favourites but Season 11 is in my personal view the strongest and most unique season to date. With episodes ranging from racial controversy to a trilogy of episodes setting the boys in Imaginationland and ended up with its own DVD releases.Episode 1: With Apologies To Jesse Jackson: This is a Randy Marsh episode and shows the true no holds barred attitude that Matt Stone & Trey Parker have towards writing an episode. Randy is on an episode of Wheel of Fortune and accidentally uses the N word, which causes an uproar and singles Randy out as ""That N***er Guy."" This episode is obviously a reflection on the American society in relation to the N word and satires the whole subject, extremely funny episode with some great one liners.Episode 2: Cartman Sucks: Again this is another controversial episode but this one is entirely around Cartman, of a night Cartman has Butters stay over at his house and while Butters is asleep, Cartman plays pranks on Butters then takes pictures of it. One prank backfires on Cartman which he's afraid will make people think he's gay, he thinks Kyle has the picture and is ready to show it to the class so Cartman enters on a panicky mission to try and save his skin. Amazingly funny as we see Cartman show some vulnerability.Episode 3: Lice Capades: One of the boys has head lice and Cartman leads a mission to try and find out who it is. Meanwhile in one of the boys heads one of the lice suspects that their environment will be aware of the affect the lice are having and may try to get rid of them. Now it's a race against time to try and convince the Lice that the environment wants to get rid of them. A great parody episode that shows the evil side of Cartman as he goes on this manhunt simply to make fun of the person with lice.Episode 4: The Snuke: One day while in class a young Muslim boy is introduced as the new student, Cartman becomes suspicious that he may be a terrorist and enlists Kyle to help him look into the background of this kid. In a 24 style episode Cartman unwittingly discovers a conspiracy to take down America and its government. This is possibly THE most controversial episode of them all as it made the news in England for the ending, the clear parody of Hilary Clinton is hysterical and makes this an enjoyable episode.Episode 5: Fantastic Easter Special: Stan starts to question the point of Easter which brings him into a conspiracy that has been kept a secret for 2000 years. A great parody of the Da Vinci Code that sees the return of Jesus in one hell of a cool setting and Kyle being Jewish has the opportunity to kill Jesus, will he do it? Enjoy this episode to find out.Episode 6: D-Yikes: Mrs. Garrison is dumped again and she takes it out on the class, the boys get sick of the constant screaming and ranting by Mrs. Garrison and they employ someone to help them out. A classic Mr./Mrs. Garrison episode with one hysterical ending.Episode 7: Night of the Living Homeless: Kyle is approached by a single Homeless man who's looking for some change, after giving the homeless man change more homeless people show up in South Park until it becomes an infestation. Cartman creates a goal for himself to jump as many homeless people as he can on his skateboard, while Kyle and the rest of the gang are on a mission to solve the Homeless problem. This is a great parody episode of Night of the Living Dead which gives yet another great part to Randy and shows how stupid he can be.Episode 8: Le Petit Tourette: One day whilst in a toy store, Cartman discovers something wonderful, something that he never believed that could be possible, he discovered Tourettes Syndrome. He sees a kid swearing and getting away with it and he decides that this would be a great excuse to insult those he hates to their faces and get away with it, little does he know however that him being Tourettes deliberately developes into something much worse which he didn't expect.Episode 9: More Crap: Another great Randy Marsh episode, in which Randy endeavours on having the worlds biggest poo, He's faced by some competition however, by the legendary number one at everything, Bono. I have to admit this is the weakest of all the episodes but it still has its classic moments, especially when Bono is in the picture.Episode 10,11,12: Imaginationland: One day Cartman is out to prove to Kyle that Leprechauns exist, the boys made a deal that if Cartman can prove they exist then Kyle must suck his balls. Cartman does manage to capture a Leprechaun but it was on a mission to deliver a warning to Imaginationland of a pending terrorist attack on our imagination. The boys are picked up by an eccentric man who takes the boys to Imaginationland which while they're there the terrorist attack takes place. Kyle, Stan & Butters enter on a mission to help fight the bad side of our Imagination and the terrorists, whilst Cartman sets out to prove that the Leprechaun was real so he can get Kyle to suck his Balls. An absolutely hysterical trilogy of episodes that show the genuine imagination of the South Park creators.Episode 13:  Guitar Queer-o: Stan and Kyle are the best players on the computer game Guitar Hero and they are signed by a record company who wants to display their skills by then gaining 100,000 points at a show in the arcade. Kyle gets manipulated by the record company and is convinced to get a new and better partner, Stan takes it badly and buys a new game called heroin hero in which he must chase the dragon. Again this is an incredibly funny episode that makes fun of those who take these games seriously and spend way too much time on them.Episode 14: The List: The girls of South Park elementary create a list of who they think the cutest boy in the school is. Kyle is placed last on the list but can't believe that he was placed lower on the list than Cartman, this uncovers a conspiracy that the boys would have never expected. It's a great episode that gives us a nostalgic look at some classic moments from previous episodes.As you can see from the descriptions this is a great set of episodes that everybody should own."
"South Park is my favorite show and I watch the season DVDs over and over.  Just when it seems SP has reached its peak, it keeps coming up with creative shows that cover the latest fads in our popular culture and sociopolitical consciousness.  Although ""Make Love Not Warfare"" from season 10 is still my favorite episode, season 11 provides another solid crop of classics, from the openings of ""With Apologies to Jesse Jackson"" and ""D-Yikes"" to the conclusions of ""Imaginationland, Episode III"" and ""The Night of the Living Homeless.""Disc 1:""With Apologies to Jesse Jackson""--Who can ever forget Randy Marsh's faux pas on ""Wheel of Fortune,"" the way he apologized to Jesse ""the emperor of black people"" Jackson, and his fight to ban a hateful slur from society with the help of Michael Richards and Mark Fuhrman?  Meanwhile, a midget author who speaks at the school provides amusement for Cartman and an epiphany for Stan.  Instant classic.""Cartman Sucks""--There are several peculiar incidences in this season that put into question Cartman's sexuality.  This episode is one of them.  Cartman takes a picture with a certain body part of a sleeping Butters in his mouth.  When Cartman learns what such a photo means, he tries to take another photo with Butters to reverse it, but Butters's dad walks in on them and sends his son to bi-curious camp.  Of course, SP fans know Butters's dad has some bi-curious issues of his own.  Meanwhile, Cartman must make sure the offensive photos does not get out.""Lice Capades""--It is revealed that someone in Mrs. Garrison's class has head lice and the students turn vicious with suspicion.  Of course, SP can't just scratch the surface; if you will, it needs to dig deeper by covering a louse community destroyed by the shampoo treatment.  A lot of movie references in this one.""The Snuke""--A new student arrives in class who is a Muslim and immediately sparks Cartman's suspicions.  Turns out there is a terrorist attack planned, but not by Muslims--and it involves Hillary Clinton's unmentionable.  Clinton's voice makes her sound like a down home southern gal, not a Senator from New York.  I like how so much information can be found on the Internet and the blinking 12:00 on the ""24"" clock after the power goes out.""Fantastic Easter Special""--Stan questions what easter eggs and bunnies have to do with Christ's resurrection and learns about the secret ""Hare Club For Men"" (where do they come up with this stuff?) A Da Vinci Code style mystery is unveiled and Matt and Trey get back at the head of the American Catholic League who had been critical of SP and said some anti-Semitic things in the past.  Hmmmm, the papal mitre does look like it belongs on a rabbit.  ""Hippitus, hoppitus,"" indeed.Disc 2:""D-Yikes""--I love the opening to this one!  I remember when it was first aired I struggled to stop laughing after Mrs. Garrison storms into the classroom complaining about men.  This episode is one of the funniest SPs ever.  I like when Garrison announces she's gay and Stan replies, ""Again?""  And the name of the lesbian bar is great!  I've never seen the movie ""300,"" but it's a takeoff on that.""The Night Of The Living Homeless""--SP is suddenly overrun with homeless people begging for change.  When the boys learn to mystery behind the onslaught of beggars, can they, with the help of some old school NWA & The Posse 8-Ball ""City of Compton"" style rap, save the day?Le Petit Tourette""--Cartman sees a kid cussing uncontrollably in a toy store and learns that the kid has Tourette's Syndrome (is this a subject right up SP's alley, or what?!).  Cartman is given an idea that makes him so happy he breaks out in song.  Of course, his plan backfires when he starts blurting out things that, to him, are more damaging and offensive than ""%#@& #$!!*() #%!($#@@&/.""""More Crap""--Randy Marsh passes a world record size BM.  when his record is broken, his life's quest is to get it back--but Bono is bound (if you will) to stop him.  I actually agree with the point they make about Bono, but this episode has a very nasty part--and I'm not talking about the BMs.Disc 3:""Imaginationland""--OK, the bet Cartman made with Kyle is hilarious.  I laughed to tears when I first saw it on TV, but what does it say about Cartman's sexuality?  Is that a prize a straight guy would want?  I mean, another guy performing the task?  What's up with that?  Anyway, the boys go on a trip to a land of imaginary characters--including my favorite, Pac-Man, though I don't like that he's sometimes given teeth--and it's hit with a terrorist attack.  Yes, terrorists have now attacked our imaginations.  Meanwhile, Cartman takes Kyle to court and Stan and Kyle are taken to the Pentagon for questioning.""Imaginationland, Episode II""--That opening dream sequence is from Monty Python.  The terrorists break down a wall and unleash the evil characters of our imagination and now imaginations are really running wild, especially when Cartman's demented Christmas woodland critters show up.  Stan and Kyle help the feds break through the portal to Imaginationland but, just before the troops charge in, Kyle may finally have to pay his debt to Cartman.""Imaginationland, Episode III""--With the help of Butters, the good imaginary characters set out to battle the evil ones.  Kyle has to stop the Pentagon from destroying Imaginationland before the good characters have a chance to win.  Al Gore, however, might doom everyone when he sees the evil character from his imagination.  Oh, and the Cartman/Kyle bet finally gets settled...sort of.""Guitar Queer-o""--Great!  In typical SP fashion, the importance of Guitar Hero is built up all out of proportion.  This episode shows how Matt and Trey keep up with the fads of pop culture.  I also like this episode because I'm a Kansas fan.""The List""--There's a list the girls created ranking the boys in their class from cutest to ugliest and Kyle is ranked last.  That can't be right!  Kyle is adorable!  Something must be wrong!"
"Even in it's eleventh season, South Park manages to still be the funniest animated show on TV today.  Proof of that statement can be seen in the opening episode, appropriately titled ""With Apologies to Jesse Jackson"", in which Stan's dad Randy goes on Wheel of Fortune, and gets the wrong idea.  If you've never seen this episode before and are easily offended, well, I suggest you don't watch it.  For the rest of us though, this episode is worth the price of admission alone.  Not to mention the simply brilliant ""Imaginationland"" trilogy of episodes, as well as the very funny ""Cartman Sucks"" and ""Lice Capades""; which once again find creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker not only pushing limits, but obliterating them.  Matt and Trey also have a fine time spoofing things as well, including 24 with ""The Snuke"", zombies with ""Night of the Living Homeless"", Bono's work (and their Emmy win) with ""More Crap"", 300 with ""D-Yikes!"", and the mega-popular Guitar Hero with ""Guitar Queer-o"".  The season really reaches one of it's best moments with ""Le Petit Tourette"", which finds Cartman faking having Tourette's syndrome.  While season closing episodes ""Guitar Queer-o"" and ""The List"" aren't anything too special, the season as a whole is still another winning and ungodly funny season of the long running show.  All in all, South Park continues to raise the bar for hysterical offensiveness, and we should all definitely be glad that it does, and hasn't become a stagnant shell of it's former self like another long running prime time animated series that will remain nameless."
"South Park season eleven is a great season of the show. It contains great episodes and the only time they weren't of classic status was in Lice Capades. The episodes included in this set are:With Apologies To Jesse Jackson- Randy solves the wheel of fortune puzzle with the N word as he comes to understand why being classified by a word is annoying when it reminds you of a past you want to forget. (People who annoy you.)Cartman Sucks- Cartman gets Butter's sent to gay counselling camp as he tries to stop Kyle from showing the class provocative pictures of him. (Eric Cartman's mother called, she found the photo's)Lice Capades- A slower episode where the boys lice symbolize the annoyance we are as inhabitants to the planet. (Smart idea, poor execution)The Snuke- Hilary Clinton is under attack as Cartman plays the part of Jack Bauer in a 24 spoof. (The Snuke is in her Sn*tch)Fantastic Easter Special- Stan learns why we paint easter eggs in a Da Vinci Code Spoof. (Peeps!)D-Yikes- Mrs. Garrison finds a club for others like her but when Persians want to take over it turns into a '300' standoff. (Scissor me timbers).Night Of The Living Homeless- Great episode where homeless people play the part of zombies. (Does anyone have any change?)Le Petite Tourette- Cartman pretends to have Tourette's syndrome in an attempt to say whatever he wants. (P*ss! In your mouth!)More Crap- Randy breaks the world record for biggest crap until Bono steps in as the world's biggest piece of crap.(This show is emmy winning).Imaginationland I,II,III- The boys finally hit on the Iraq war in the most intelligent and entertaining thing they have done so far. Man Bear Pig, Al Gore and the Critterland Christmas Critter's all make appearances as well as Alien, Santa, Luke Skywalker and Jason Voorhies. (The terrorists are attacking our imaginations!)Guitar Queer-o- Stan and Kyle want to be rock stars but the life may be too difficult. (The best use of in show product advertisment since Make Love, Not Warcraft)The List- The girl's ranking of the boys looks finds them all reacting different ways in a more low profile still entertaining episode. (Burn it down, burn it down to the gwound.)The set is the same as all the previous ones with well chosen art work and safe DVD storage with easy access and convenient episode listings/descriptions on the box foldouts. Other than previews the only special features that have been on South Park sets recently are Matt and Trey giving mini-commentaries which are the most honest and entertaining commentaries around despite being under five minutes each.I loved this season, I feel it is has reached a new plateau for the series and hit a new stride creatively. South Park as a concept is a series that is constantly not only changing itself but evolving to keep current. The first two seasons were one thing then season three started it in a new direction through the fourth and fifth seasons. Then season six was similar to season eleven in that for me it hit a new stride and was near perfect beginning to end. The trend of the sixth season grew through the seventh and season eight was another new height for the series. The ninth season started it on a new track through the award winning tenth season to season eleven which for me is another solid season beginning to end (despite Lice Capades which had funny moments but didn't hold my attention, a few more moments of the boys might have fixed this).The recent South Park seasons have been better in the tail end or second run of episodes. I think since episodes are split up in runs from March to May and then September/October to December this is probably because they have more time over the summer to workout idea's ahead of time and improve what they didn't like looking back on the first half.The twelth season is coming out on DVD/Blu-Ray soon and it's not as great as season eleven overall but it is again the series moving in a new evolutionary direction and I look forward to seeing where it will be going next. If season eleven is a new highpoint then season twelve is a more than entertaining and satirical enough passtime until the show reaches it's next creative plateau. Here's hoping it won't fall like Simpsons and Family guy did."
"And I mean that in every way ;). She looks so pure and innocent. As I said about &#34;Strangers With Candy&#34; I am not sure this series could be shown on TV these days because it isn't politically correct enough. Too many people have forgotten how to laugh at themselves any more.I have also heard that Sarah is kind of like she is in this series in real life in the sense that she is outspoken and sometimes people are offended by her honesty and political incorrectness. Lighten up America (and others), humor and laughing at oneself is better medicine than anything a doctor could give you."
I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this. Sarah Silverman is soo darn crazy funny. Season 1 is a must have!
Loved it on TV and I love having it here. I just wish the series has continued because there was much more to tell.
"There is usually a &#34;whats going to happen next&#34;  character to these episodes. Well acted, powerful relationships. A nice package."
"Jericho is FAAAAAAAAAANTASTIC!!!!!  Ignore the naysayers, watch this series for some enjoyable television.Some GREAT young (and even older) actors and actresses in this series; they do a great job balancing the serious and the comedic elements.Watch this show with an open mind.  There's a big element of &#34;WHAT IF&#34; in this series, and you have to roll with that for it to hold your interest.  Accept that &#34;what if&#34; premise for what it is--the opportunity to observe human reactions to extraordinarily stressing situations in a world gone seemingly mad--and you'll really enjoy this show.Obviously, any television show (or even movie) has practical limitations in how accurately it can depict &#34;the end of the world as we know it.&#34;  Accept those limitations, don't stress out on the over-simplifications.I kind of envy those who discover this series for the first time...getting to meet and know the people of Jericho is a real treat.Enjoy!"
The series is action packed and keeps you guessing who is the good and who is the bad guy. I have enjoyed the series a great deal compared to no acting on reality TV and various contests that make up network TV today.
"I could do without the romance stuff, but otherwise this series grew on me.  wish they kept it going a wile"
About life after nuclear war. I recommend. It to all adults only.  Amazon you need to buy the rest of the seasons.
Fun to watch folks being completely unprepared for disaster.  Hollywood shows they dont understand farmers and country folk very well but the show and premise are still good entertainment.
This show had me at the edge of my seat. It is realistic as to troubles faced during war or disaster. I wasn't sure who was bad and who was good and I enjoyed it from episode one.
"I have now come to that stage of life where I have seen every standard TV plot so many times that I am now able to predict the denouement almost as soon as I see the setup and have declared a personal embargo on watching any more shows about doctors, lawyers or cops. While some of the current offerings (House, Scrubs, etc) are quite passable - there are other occupations, and other situations which in the hands of the creative, will offer sufficient interest to keep viewers returning on a regular basis. Shows like ""Lost"" and ""Ugly Betty"" are splendid examples of what can be done by stepping outside of the cop-lawyer-doc box, and ""Jericho - Season One"" is another. Take an intriguing and (for television) a semi-original situation, involve a large cast of interesting people reacting to it and voila - something that will bring back the audience, over and over. Especially when it is a situation that we might imagine happening to ourselves. After 9/11, and Katrina (which provided the genesis of ""Jericho"" to its creators) it is all to easy to imagine what happens when the world we know suddenly ends, right in the middle of all our mundane plans for a perfectly ordinary day.Which is exactly what happens to the citizens of the small town of Jericho, Kansas, to the family of Johnston Green (Gerald McRaney) and their neighbors and friends. Jericho is a small, pleasant place, full of people going about their own business - farming, stocking the grocery store shelves, going through a mayoral election, planning a wedding and enduring an audit by a visiting IRS agent. The school children are off on a field trip and the Green's black-sheep son Jake suddenly appears needing a great deal of money - the only ripple in the pleasant still pool of a modern American life. In one of the most quietly effective sequences, the camera follows two children, playing hide and seek in a back yard, while one climbs on the roof of a shed, and then onto the house roof. The boy suddenly freezes there, silhouetted against the clouds and the sky - and then we see what he has seen; a mushroom cloud, coming up from a line of mountains on the distant horizon.And that is the exact point where the people of Jericho, and a handful of visitors who just happen to be there begin a long slow devolution from the twenty-first century into something that more resembles the frontier West... and then to a condition that looks more like the warring city-states of Renaissance Italy, or classical Greece. First they struggle to figure out just has happened to the rest of the country - and then begins the fight to survive, ending in a cliff-hanger which promises a large audience for the second-season premiere. It makes for a more interesting television show than I had thought, when I first heard about it. The first season set of 22 episodes is neatly packaged on 6 discs. Commentary and deleted scenes are included for selected episodes on the same disc. I would have much rather that deleted scenes be edited into the episode where they belonged, to make a sort of ""director's cut"", rather than having them tacked on as an appendage. The omitted scenes would have done a lot for the overall story; it's clear that they were omitted to shorten each episode for broadcast.Other extra features included a rather interesting ""making of Jericho"" feature, which included some actor auditions, and a look at set construction, and a short about disaster preparedness, which included some unintentionally hilarious 1950s Civil Defense footage on how one should shelter under a desk or behind some furniture in the event of a nuclear holocaust."
"Great writing, believable story line. Great characters, each developed and evolved. Great acting, each done well. An interesting look into a possible future."
"This is a pretty realistic view of what would happen during a nuclear war.  I do believe people would come together and help each other.  That being said, communities would come together like they did in Jericho and would help each other, until the food ran out.  After that it would be every person for themselves.  Luckily we don't have to see that.  What we do see is what would happen after a  nuclear exchange.  Modern things stop working, food stops arriving and people that get common injuries and colds all of a sudden become life threatening events.  I like the stories, I like the characters.  Great show all around."
"if this show had come on in the last year or so, i feel confident it would have lasted more than one-and-a-half seasons. it was an excellent show."
Saw some episodes when it was on TV but missed the rest. Good build of characters. Great story line. Worth the watch.
"I found this entire series worthy of a 5. Entertaining, and with imagination, and I did not want it to end."
"i've had this one for a little while.  I figured it was finally time to check out Jericho and see what the buzz was really all about.  Even i've seen a preview or two of the show.  It didnt really do it justice at all.  I watched the whole series in 3 days time and it left me wanting more 22 episodes packed with all kinds of intrigue, sub plots with the different characters throughtout the show.  It goes without saying that this is one of the shows to look out for in 2008.  With tensions high between Jericho and the neighboring town of New Bern.Along with other things forming in this series it is evident that the show hasnt even begun to hit its stride.  Great characters, well done stories and design make this something all should check sooner rather than later."
"This is one of the best series I have seen in a long time. The story is compelling, makes you think about what could really be, and shows how easily we can turn on each other when the chips are down. Each episode left me looking forward to the next....... and then I found out that there is no ending to the series. I couldn't believe it. I searched the Internet from every angle; only to confirm that the series ended with season 2. I did discover that the story continues in what I thought was &#34;book format&#34;, so I eagerly ordered the 'book' for my Kindle; only to find out that it is a comic book, not a real book.So, if you can live with not seeing the series completed, I would highly recommend watching it."
"This is a well-scripted, well-acted series.  Every episode is suspenseful and believable.  It's a shame the series was never completed."
"There were several places that couldn't have possibly been true to what would really happen after a nuclear strike; however, it did represent a small portion of what humanity would turn into in this country. I personally would have liked to have seen the storyline go a little more toward reality, but, I understand that our six-pack society, those who care more about the unreality of hollywood than current affairs, could not handle it. I really liked this show in spite and watched it on a marathon status."
"Good series.  Has everything.  Some adventure, some sap, some mystery.  Really pulled me in when learn past lives of characters before the bombs."
"I know it, this is a friggin' looong read. The short version: I like JERICHO, and I recommend it. Now, here's the long version.SPOILERS, here and there, everywhere.Great, something nutty survivalists and I can agree on. So I really like JERICHO. It's a strong show and addictive, with a tantalizing premise that should geek out almost any casual fan. Today, end-of-the-world stories have become even more fascinating and timely. JERICHO nicely slides into that space, dropping a tale of fear and struggle and of survival and hope. JERICHO tells of frightened townspeople pulling together under duress and facing down each daunting obstacle. As it turns out, JERICHO is also about nuts. There's a memorable scene late in Season One regarding nuts, and even a real life, save-the-show campaign involving nuts.The story begins with residents of small town Jericho, Kansas glimpsing a shocking mushroom cloud blooming, off in the distance. Word rapidly gets out that Denver and Atlanta have become the targets of nuclear attacks, and who knows how many other cities were bombed? Very shortly after, Jericho, population five thousand, finds itself alarmingly cut off, with minimal and dubious contact with the outside world. In the following days and weeks, the town finds itself contending with a plague of challenges, from radioactive fallout to widespread paranoia to roving marauders to the inevitable arrival of shellshocked refugees from affected neighboring towns and cities. All too soon, the town's resources begin to peter out. Just how long can Jericho and its people hang on, before it all falls apart?The collapse of civilization has a way of leaving deep psychological scars. When stripped of the underpinnings of society and government, it's awfully hard not to become reduced to a caveman denominator. Jericho, influenced by its mayor and his sons, tries to cling to its pre-apocalyptic ideals. It makes for riveting viewing as Jericho's tiny geopolitical dynamics are shaken up and a new, more aggressive social culture emerges. It's a whole new world, a crappy, blighted one. The standard of living has devolved. Horses become a popular, fuel-saving alternative to automobiles. Windmills prove to be a seriously viable source of energy. Food is rationed, ammo is doled out, medicine is hoarded. Money loses value. Bartering is the new money. For Jericho, its salt mines provide an invaluable trading commodity. Meanwhile, the residents are still in the dark as to how widespread the destruction is, or if America still even exists as they know it.Despite the post-apocalyptic, sci-fi setting, JERICHO is fueled by human drama. The show doesn't make the mistake of forsaking storytelling for flash. Oh, there are taut action sequences here and there (""Rogue River,"" ""Crossroads,"" & the final 4 episodes). And the ongoing suspense is there, even though the series commits itself to a slow burn, taking its sweet time in divulging answers (which probably threw off some viewers). But, mostly, the focus is on the characters' development and their personal story arcs, set in a world-gone-mad backdrop. Jericho is a tiny town, with its share of secrets and notoriety. Extramarital stuff goes on, and family conflict. Political wrangling goes on. A local crime lord lurks on the fringes. A secretive neighbor moves in. But Jericho is also a place where redemption can be earned, estranged families reunited, a sense of community galvanized, and a sweet but unlikely romance blossom between, say, a down-to-earth farmer and a prickly IRS auditor.The acting is very good, the performances, for the greater part, grow on one and impact in the emotional gut. It's a pretty hefty ensemble cast, but JERICHO gravitates towards the Greens, Jericho's first family and led by patriarch and town mayor Johnston Green (a wonderfully understated Gerald McRaney), who also happens to be an ex-Army Ranger. It's so nice to check in with McRaney again, as I haven't seen him since hisSimon & Simon - Season Onedays (I dug it whenever Johnston put on his cowboy hat). I like that he and Pamela Reed achieve a certain believability as a longtime married couple. Props also to the hissable Michael Gaston, who plays Johnston's scheming political rival Gray Anderson, a fella you can't help but throw middle fingers at. I'm not sure how much acting chops it takes to make your character so detested, but Gaston pulls it off. It helps that Anderson isn't nasty all the time, and, in fact, fervently believes that he's a guy doing the right thing, and, sometimes, he even does. Meanwhile, while Ashley Scott is a striking actress, I wish more screen time had also been given to the quietly vibrant Sprague Grayden, who plays schoolteacher/car mechanic/engineer/all-around cutie Heather Lisinski. I like her as much as Scott, with both gorgeous actresses flaunting a nice chemistry with lead actor Skeet Ulrich. On a minus, I wasn't digging Dale, that taciturn kid who works at the grocery store. The earlier shows made him a sympathetic character, but, later on, he transforms into an unlikable opportunist.But the two most interesting - and enigmatic - characters happen to be Jake Green and Robert Hawkins. Jake, effectively played by Skeet Ulrich, is JERICHO's stoic central hero and is the Green family's troubled black sheep who returns to town after five mysterious years of absence. No one's privy to what Jake's been thru since he went away, but, there's no doubt at all that his many newfound skills go quite a ways in keeping Jericho afloat in the trying times ahead. It doesn't take long before the townspeople start looking to Jake as their go-to guy. Another intriguing character is the immensely capable, new-to-town Robert Hawkins (British actor Lennis James, here sporting a Yankee accent), who passes himself off as a St. Louis cop (he's not). Lennis James does a great job of ambiguously toeing that line between good guy and bad guy, all the while exuding that dangerous vibe; you're just never quite sure which side he's on (I mean, even his family is wary of him). Regarding Jake and Hawkins, we don't really get the backstory until the episodes ""The Day Before"" and ""A.K.A.""There aren't a lot of weak episodes here, with each one integral to the ongoing story arc and several being of the heartwrenching sort (""Winter's End,"" ""Why We Fight""). Episode 17 (""One Man's Terrorist"") I wasn't too fond of, that one focusing on Emily's amazingly bland fiance Roger. But then the ensuing five episodes frenetically bring it home. In the months ahead, it'll turn out that Jericho, even with its assorted problems, had fared better than most other places. This makes the town a desirable target. This plays out in the last four episodes, culminating in the slam bang finale as Jericho is forced to go to war against an invading neighboring town. Season One's final episode ""Why We Fight"" ends on a cliffhanger, at which point, CBS pulled the plug on the series. And, boy, did that tick people off. But, thanks to the concerted efforts of its fans, who delivered thousands of pounds of nuts to CBS, the network greenlit a second season in the form of seven new episodes. And thank goodness! Seriously, a cliffhanger is NOT the way to go out!Sidenote: Here's a cool gimmick: Each episode features a different Morse code played over the title shot, which offers a hint of what's going on in that particular episode. I've got to learn Morse code.JERICHO - THE FIRST SEASON comes in a 6 disc package, and CBS doesn't stint on the bonus features. ""Building Jericho"" is the interesting 24-minute-long Making Of documentary, which includes snippets of cast audition clips (of Lennis James, Kenneth Mitchell, Pamela Reed, and Sprague Grayden). ""What If?"" is a sobering 9-minute segment delving into the history of the atomic bomb and the terrifying possibility of a nuclear attack today. You want episode commentaries? Or deleted scenes? You got 'em! Fifteen of the 22 episodes come with either an episode commentary or deleted scenes (or, sometimes, both). The commentaries are mostly by the executive producers (exec. producer/director Jon Turteltaub is actually kinda funny), although Skeet and Lennie James do pop in to drop their own words (Skeet in ""Rogue River""; Lennie in ""Red Flag""; Skeet & Lennie in ""Vox Populi""). Would've been nice, though, to have commentary on the last episode ""Why We Fight."" But, overall, not too shabby for extras.Now, if only the eyeball network can see fit to extend the second season beyond a mere seven episodes..."
"This series is so intense and makes you think! Never expected to have all seasons, but thanks to Amazon I now do!Check it out."
Got my attention from the first episode to the last one in season two.  Very time appropriate for our current time in history.  Just the right amount of drama and action for my taste.  Wish it could go on and on but know all good things must come to an end.
"Really captivating series, and the characters well acted.  I liked the ending, just as it should be if ever we face such events."
"What would you do during a disaster scenario where information is scarce and everything is headed into a downward spiral? Most likely, try to keep your head above water. That is the premise of Jericho, a smaller city outside of a location that experienced a major nuclear attack. It follows a town as they deal with the likely problems we as a society would face when things turn extremely rough. Sadly, it only lasted for two seasons, meaning at some point the story line will simply drop off, never to be continued. :("
I'm really enjoying this series.  I wish I found it sooner than now.  It's an interesting perspective on what would happen if life changed as we know it.  Will we remain civil or go into anarchy?
I thought Jericho was a great series. To bad that they seemed to have canceled it in the second season with only 7 episodes.
"I enjoyed this series , a show about what happens after nuclear bombs go off in theUNITED states. Some unlikely heroes emerge and a town grapples with their new reality.The writing is good the character development is interesting. Characters with human flaws but stillAble to hold on to that which is good.I enjoyed the first season and now watching the second season."
I'm not big on spending a lot of time on fiction.  BUT...The wife LOVES drama.  Add a dystopian view to it and she adores it.  This was right up her alley and she would watch another three seasons had they made them.
This caught my attention from the first minutes I started watching. I could not wait to see what happens next. I recommend this series. I have watches both seasons and am hoping for a third.
"I really really like this series. At least they got a chance to give closure to the story line, but I can't help imagining what they COULD have done with several seasons. Fantastic story, great character interaction, intense political intrigue. You will enjoy it and then probably wish it could have gone on for more than 2 seasons."
"When I first watched the pilot, I saw too many pretty people with nice hair and though they suffered from a nuclear attack far away, no one suffered from soap and water much less styling goods.  As time went on, people complained about lack of goods but it never really makes much of a dent.  The lack of gasoline, etc. is discussed but in the end it really doesn't affect the residents much.  Besides these concerns, I became more involved in the show and the realism of the setting didn't bother me as much.  Actors meld with their characters and they become more interesting and human.  Jericho in Kansas is a place where the bombs were not supposed to go off and be a safety zone for the terrorists who have detonated the bombs.  The residents don't know what went on and only gets bits and pieces as the series moves on.  The main characters are Jake Green, the son of the mayor who has been mysteriously absent for several years.  He seems to have been in Iraq as a soldier.  The other main character is Hawkins,  an African-American man who mysteriously appears with his family for unknown reasons just before the bombing.  As time goes on, Jake and Hawkins appear to be the heros who will save the day.  The series becomes more and more detailed and exciting.  I was impressed with the choice of great actors in the series including Gerald McRainey who plays the mayor, Pamela Reed as his wife and Lennie James as Robert Hawkins.  One of the most impressive things in the series is allowing Lennie James, a British-African actor. to rise up to be a star.  There aren't many black actors being allowed to act and participate in a show except as the buddy and Hawkins is a character who surpasses everyone else without argument.  The series only lasted a year and a half but if very impressive.  It began when the networks were attempting to challenge cable channels with higher quality series just as they did with Lost and Desperate Housewives.  Those shows lasted longer and lost their impact so maybe it was luck that this show was short and still impressive."
"Loved this show when it was on. Missed a lot of it at the end of reg. season when we went away on a long vacation so I was thrilled to be able to watch it. Loved the interaction of the characters, the threads of all the little side stories and especially loved the character Jake. A good mystery as well as you try to figure everything out, who is Hawkins & exactly what is he up to? Who are the good guys & bad guys?"
I loved Jericho! Suspenseful and held my interest the whole time. The acting was well done and the actors were excellent in their roles. I appreciated that there was no filthy language and sex scenes!!! It held to family values and a theme that is very possibly on the horizon for our country! Good for is to be prepared!!!
"The characters were awesome, riveting and exciting, just like our neighbors. So realistic. It makes it so real. Thanks to Amazon I was lucky enough to get a chance to watch the series. Six years after it was filmed I had an opportunity to watch it. I just wish it was still on. Thank God for Amazon!"
Love this show. I found I had to keep watching and watching to see what would happen.Looking for the next season soon.
"I was so sorry to find out that this show was not continued.  It is wrapped up a bit. but it was really good with great character development and storyline.  I enjoyed all of it.At first I thought it was going to be cheesy... but it wasn't.  Yeah, there was some stuff that didn't make sense... like that despite no electricity, the women all had perfect hair.  Really silly... oh and they all dressed great despite the fact that they had no access to the outside world and no way to wash or iron clothing.  That was also silly.  But I overlooked that because it was really a good show and fun and exciting."
I like futuristic films and was never able to watch this onT.V. as my husband does not and wouldn't watch it. Now I get to watch it on my Kindle.
Very realistic.  Really makes you think about what would happen if someone did this kind of thing.  How would America react?
Very well put together drama.  The characters were perfect for the stories being told.  Some of them were new faces who I will look for on other movies and TV shows.  Sometimes the music was too loud and took away from what was happening.  I liked this series.  The end left you to wonder how it all would turn out but it seemed pretty apparent the good ole USA would prevale.
"As someone that grew up in small town America this well written story was fascinating.  Nuclear war is an insane idea, but we live with the possibility every day.  The possible tragedy is explored with what I felt were real people, good acting and reasonable human interaction.  The story line is like one very long novel and being able to watch episode after episode at your leisure with Prime is the perfect way to get the most from this story.  The novel celebrates those that strive to cling to positive moral values in the face of unimaginable hardships."
"Was skeptical at first, but this show just grew on me.  Great ensemble of actors, good stories, action scenes are well done.  Check it out.....you'll like it."
"This is a great show.  I wished they would have continued on with it.  Watching the whole season on Prime is great.  No commercials and not having to wait until the next week or two to watch the next episode.  Unfortunately, the plot line seems plausible; But makes for a great TV show."
This is a wonderful show. I don't understand why it was cancelled. Anyone that likes survival stories will love this program.
A good story line. The characters are believeable. Sad that there were only two seasons on Tv. However seasons three and four are available in comic novel form.
The first season of Jericho was as  good as any sci fi show.  Suspenseful great cast good story lines.  Shoulda been a classic .
AWESOME SHOW........I DIDN'T GET TO SEE THE PILOT ....NOW I HAVE & GET THE BACKGROUND OF THE SHOW LOT MORE
"Jericho will always be my favorite show, hands down. I'm watching it for the 3rd time and have convinced most of my family to watch it as well."
Quick Overview: Jake returns to the town of Jericho to work out some money matters with his father. He makes a speedy exit that is halted abruptly when a ginormous explosion rocks Jericho. Now the whole population is cut off from everything.  Secrets and such come out as these citizens ban together to survive.Great plot. Viewers learn a lot about all of the characters and their histories as they maneuver this big scale event. It didn't take me long to get into the swing on things. The cast does a remarkable job working together and delivering believable dialogue.
"I did not watch it when it was on TV, so I wanted to see what is was like. I love it I am looking forward to finding out what happen to everyone."
"I actually really like this show and I remember thinking when it was being advertised that I should watch it, but never did. Now that it is no longer available, I am sad to know that I never helped with the ratings by watching it."
This is a good show. I really enjoy it. It keeps you in suspense. I would recommend it to watch.
"Started out as a skeptical viewer and can now say I'm an addicted fan. While this show is fantasy, it has definitely caused me to ponder our vulnerability and the possibility of life without the power grid. Scary thought, but I enjoy seeing how the writers carried it out in each episode. Hope I never have to find out what it's really like!"
Every episode had excitement and suspense and character development.  It has a fascinating storyline that makes you think &#34;what if&#34; and then you see how this town handles not knowing the why and what of the attack on America that they survived.
"Cancelling Jericho was a serious error on the part of the network. Wonderful, believable characters, excellent acting and an intriguing story line. What more could you ask for in escapist television. The story kept me constantly asking how I would handle a given situation, what would my roll be?  This show is on the same entertainment level as Walking Dead, too bad there won't be anymore."
"Wish they would have continued this series, but at least they brought it to a conclusion somewhat instead of just leaving you hanging."
"Great writing, and compelling characters in a dramatic situation, are some of the reasons why Jericho is very compelling serial television.  The story centers on the events in the fictitious town of Jericho, Kansas, after a nuclear attack.  The immediate concern is survival, and then maintaining basic government structure, medical facilities, and utilities.  As characters are defined, past lives and secrets are disclosed, and roles, old and new, are formed.Exactly what happened is a mystery, and while some things are revealed, it is evident to viewers that there are several hidden conspiracies.  The situation gets more complex, as new characters appear, and a hazy picture of the new America slowly takes shape.The key figures in Jericho, are from the Green, Richmond, and Hawkins families.  The ensemble cast is great overall, but Skeet Ulrich's performance as wayward son come home, Jake Green is superlative, and the glue that holds much of story together.  Gerald McRaney as Johnson Green, the mayor of Jericho, brings incredible toughness and leadership, to a situation that demands it.  The wild card that separates Jericho from being just a post holocaust survival tale, is Robert Hawkins (Lennie James), a newcomer in town engaged in something very, very, deep.The writing is often clever and suspenseful, with unexpected developments springing up.  Although things begin slowly, the season finishes in a flurry, with the town on the verge of all out war.  Quite sobering, for a network television series.  The writers mix things up, using creative flashbacks, and bringing back characters, and even a tank, in later episodes.  While there are inconsistencies and illogical events, and some things have to be toned down for television, the story builds to a riveting conclusion, leading to a second season, that almost never was.  Family values, morals, and patriotism, are some of the values that led to the founding of America, and this series effectively touches back to them.Executive producers Jon Turteltaub and Carol Barbee provide commentary for a few episodes, and Skeet Ulrich and Lennie James, also contribute commentaries.  'Building Jericho' is a 24 minute documentary feature, about how the town of Jericho was constructed, and some interesting background information.  A series that will make you think, thrill you, make you cry, and remember what it means to be an American.  Jericho is a remarkable program that should not be missed."
I missed this series when it was on network tv.  It is nice to be able to watch it without commercials.  Thank you for making it available.
"With the world, and this country, in such upheaval, this series really hit home. Woudl I  react  as they did? who knows. And I hope I never have to find out. Me or my children or grandchildren. As I watched the episodes one right after the other I thought that this series could/should be used as a teaching tool in high schools and colleges. What would you do, how would you do it, Is any of it possible? Entertaining and frightening."
"Great interplay between characters, Gerald McRainey is great as the leader of his people, Would like to see something new with Skeet Ulrich."
"Well cast drama quite accurately depicted. Don't believe,however, Jonathan Rhys Meyers would ever be mistaken as a double for the original Henry VIII! Nor would any of the real wives and children be as glamorous as the ones Hollywood chose. But the action, the sets, the activities, the costumes, the political-religious arenas of the day were all so true to life that we must grant Hollywood some leeway. All in all, it was a marvelous portrayal of 15th-16th century England. More such dramas should be presented on TV."
"Though artist liberties were taken with the series, I love it none the less,  i have found the show to be very entertaining, and intriguing!"
"Great subject matter.  Outstanding locations and filming.Good historic reference, and very graphic.Mature subject matter.One of the best series I have seen on TV."
"While not 100 percent  historically accurate The Tudors does a good job at telling what life was like in the court of Henry VIII played brilliantly by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers.The story starts several years after Henry becomes King and goes through everything from the Field of Cloth and Gold, the various plots against the French and Spanish, the birth of Henry Fitzroy (the Kings illegitimate son) and much more.Most of the story centers on Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon and his increasing love affair with Anne Boleyn and which led him to cast Catherine off and break with the Church of Rome to marry Anne.The cast is very good. And while it is not 100 percent accurate the acting, scenery, and costumes make up for it."
"This wonderful production highlights the monster that Henry VIII was and the role of all parties from the gentry to the church in their respective grabs for power. This is a very entertaining show to watch and adds a dramatized human element to the horrible man, Henry VIII."
"This production has spared no expense on settings and costumes.  It is a visual feast.  However, beware that this show shows alot of skin/sex and is definitely not for children.  I have seen 3 seasons and felt they were all good.  While i don't like all the violence,  it does give me a feel for how brutal the times were and how easy it was to get your head chopped off."
Love this romantic show. Would recommend this to any women. The men in this show is sexy and you never know what is going to happen in each episode.
Amazing performances and beautiful settings!  Do not start watching this if you are not prepared to follow to the end.  Highly Addictive!  A little thin on historical accuracy in places but the performances seem to make you forget that.  Watching the performances of the actors in this series will make you want to watch other things they have done.  Highly recommend.
This is a docudrama about Henry the Eighth. There is a lot of action and beautiful people to keep you watching.I would not recommend this for children.Dr George Tomes
"It took a little while for me to warm up to the show - i liked it but didn't spend a whole night sleepless watching it until around episode 7, at which point there was no turning back.  As others mention already, the set designs, actors and screenplay are very well done.. but what intrigued me most was that the historical period of the story basically coincides with the division of the church, from the rule of Catholicism to the outbranches of ""protest""-antism.  And the show goes on to become a study almost (and a very entertaining one at that) of the way this came to be (in England).  The story does a pretty fair job of presenting both the integrity and corruption of the Catholicism of Europe at the time and it likewise shows how and what drove the king to accept ""reformist"" versions of Christianity.  It's a fascinating study of a subject I really knew very little about and I come away feeling more informed somehow, and entertained into the bargain.  Even if religion isn't your thing, religion and politics were once quite married and intermixed with the state and it's fascinating to see these things portrayed - and to compare them with where we are now.  A fascinating historical story.  It's no wonder Shakespeare put it on the stage in his day.  Showtime has just sexed it up a bit.  And speaking of sex, if this show doesn't convince you of the power that libido plays behind the scenes, nothing will!"
Acting is perfect! Love history and almost perfectly accurate with history. I wish the tutors did not end with Henry VIII but continued with Henry's son and then Mary and Elisabeth. After all common?
"If you want serious history, you should be reading a book.  If you want entertainment with a historical base, television is a good choice.  I am not in a position to pick out the errors of omission and commission in this series.  How many there are is not important to me.  This is not a history lesson and I wish to be entertained.  As entertainment, The Tudors succeeds!  The acting is excellent, the settings realistic, the dialog intelligent and believable.Henry the VIII is young, active, good looking and powerful.  He has two unfilled desirers, to have a son and to conquer France.  Season 1 has him working on both.  The King's favor is all-important, the series captures this and shows us why.  Without being boring, we are given enough background to understand the situation and see why Henry selects a course of action.  Many of his reason are not the best but this gives us insight into a complex personality.While knowing the story, the telling is fresh and enjoyable.  I rented the first DVD from Blockbuster for 99 cents.  After the second episode, I ordered season 1.  This is on a par with Rome and Deadwood as enjoyable entertainment with some historical background."
"My best friend and I are addicted. A riveting show that will certainly grab your attention! For people who enjoy history and period time pieces, this is the perfect show for you. An amazing cast, an amazing attention to visual detail and a story line that just couldn't be made up! A small warning though.... it is NOT suitable for children."
As I said with the other seasons I love it and the actores are greatI have watched it about 10 times
"This series is enormous in scope and devilishly all consuming. The characterizations and plots are astoundingly good and prove to be historically accurate in every vein.The acting is superb as are the cinematography, editing and presentation. I suffer no guilt at addicting myself to catching up on this splendid offering. I can say that there has not been one boring minute during the 20 episodes I've viewed."
I love this series - elegant historically accurate costumes and backgrounds with outstanding performances and a director who tells it like it really was - this is one of the very few  films I will watch again.
"While the series is very loosely based on the events of the life of Henry VIII the performances by JR Meyers, Sam Neill as Wolsey, and Jeremy Northam as Sir Thomas More really make the piece.Natalie Dormer is pitch perfect as Anne, even if we can see through her and her family and find her annoying! Maria Doyle Kennedy as the Queen is superb. She is warm, human, dignified and we actually feel sorry for all the king is throwing away for a woman who ultimately proved to not be worth it. And how much he will destroy in England in the process.Henry as a 'sleeping lion' is wonderfully portrayed. The series starts and ends looking like a 'bonkbuster' but there is a LOT of interesting stuff that will pique your interest in the real history if you can get past the nudie bits.Squishing his 2 sisters into the one who marries his friend Charles Brandon was silly and pointless, and it is amazing they never once mention Scotland in the whole 10 hours! Margaret Tudor married the king of scotland, Mary the old senior King of France, not Portugal, and he died 3 months later.The Thomas Tallis parts were just silly, and partly for shock value and more sex, but I think they were trying to show a bit about the 'common man'.The scenes between Henry and Anne light up the screen--it is interesting to see the contrast with the second series, when they are barely in the same county, let alone room. (GREAT acting in both).The costumes, settings and acting make this, while not perfect, certainly an excellent way to savor history and the period."
"Amazon's video-streaming is high-quality and the Tudors is no exception.  My husband and I love this show and while it's not 100% historically accurate, I've learned about English history a lot from watching."
"So fun to watch, keeps your interest all the way through.  Incorporates many historical events.  Great actors, beautiful costumes.  Triggers a person's interest in history, wish I had paid better attention in class all those years ago, but maybe I would have if history had come to life like it does on the Tudors screen."
"There is probably nothing more that I like to watch than a costume drama, particularly one set at a time when men were swinging swords and showing off their legs in hose. A Man for All Seasons, Ben Hur, Elizabeth, Anne of a Thousand Days, Quo Vadis, Braveheart....I could go on and on, but you get the idea.The Tudors is a costume drama fan's dream come true. Sword fights, beheadings, lusty men and women rolling in the hay and in other places...beautiful actors, great music, all abound in The Tudors. While the history shown is not always accurate, it's close enough to get the point across, and you're just having so much fun watching the high drama, you really don't care if it isn't exactly dead on point accurate. It's right up there with Rome (which to my great sorrow was only on for two seasons) as a &#34;go to&#34; show to revisit when I want the thrill of seeing yesteryear as it probably never was.Sarah Bolger gives a fantastic performance as Princess Mary, Henry Cavill  is great eye candy and does a nice job portraying Charles Brandon, and while Jonathan Rhys Meyers doesn't look a thing like Henry VIII (who was never that handsome), he captures the &#34;over-the-top&#34; behavior that Henry often displayed. But perhaps my favorite person throughout the entire series was Bishop Chapuys, played by Anthony Brophy. I wanted to cry when we received word in the show that he'd died. I thought Mr. Brophy did an excellent job.  Maria Doyle Kennedy also turns in a stellar performance as Queen Katherine.So I can highly recommend not just this Season, but the entire Series with great pleasure who anyone who likes to see men in codpieces and wearing velvet!"
"I'm rewatching this for about the 15th time. It's reaaally good. Can be disturbing, seeing the nasty ways people were slated to die - and for stupid reasons; but alas, it's all true. Recommended, for adults."
"I have been watching The Tudors since it came on the air and it has grown on me every season.  Yes, this is truly a fictional series based on truth but you won't care as you become engrossed in the series.  A viewer can end up doing research and reading websites and books in search of the truth.  The show is well acted, lush and a lot of fun, which it should be.  Henry VIII went down in history due the creativity of his marriages and his religious beliefs.  His daughter from Anne Boleyn turned out to be Britain's greatest monarch so something came out of it.  A fun show and a great entertainment.  I'm so surprised that Showtime didn't cancel it due to the cost."
"Modernized version, but well written and well acted. Lots of sex though, definitely not for kids to watch! Once you start watching, you get hooked and wanting to keep watching and wanting more. Really good show, just keep in mind, it's entertainment."
"I chose the Tudors to view as I am interested in all things about Kings and Queen histories.  The script seems to accurate.  The costumes of the period were remarkable.  I loved the entire series.  This particular season is rated for the mature audience not for high school.Viewing Henry VIII was incredible, and the wives of the king with all the court secrecy and plots was awesome, and apparently, from history real."
"This series is MUST TV!  Worth it just for the history story, but much more entertaining than most series.  The costumes are works of art and the actors are great!  I recommend the entire series!"
"Love, lust, betrayal, egocentric King....good times. This what the Tudors were all about. You know what they say, absolute power absolutly corpus"
"The Tudors great series.,a history lesson embellished with lots of mystery an sex a gore !Costuming and scenes are amazing .ACTING SUPERB."
"King Henry VIII was a pivotal figure in English and Western history.  As the Protestant Reformation sweeps Europe, the great question is whether England will remain Catholic, under the Pope's authority, or whether the King's authority shall predominate in England.  King Henry VIII settled this matter for all time, at a time when religious authority truly mattered to the conduct of national affairs in Europe.This series is dazzlingly presented, with fine acting and a gripping, if somewhat leisurely, storyline.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers turns in a bravo performance as King Henry VIII--his intensity in the role is vibrant and convincing.  Sam Neill, as usual, is particularly fine as English Cardinal Wolsey, the King's Chancellor and confidant.  Along with Meyers he dominates Season One.  All of other the key roles are splendidly cast, and the sets are lavish; this is a beautiful production.Season 1 takes us from Henry's ascension to the throne, during which he gains confidence in his role of King of England and head of state--to his love of Anne Boleyn and his rejection of the queen.  The viewer sees in action Machiavelli's admonishment in The Prince that it is deadly to cross a Prince, and dangerous to be his friend.This series is eminently watchable and a great introduction to a critical period in European history.  If it takes liberties with history, the discerning viewer will not mind.  Highly recommended.  RJB."
I didn't know what to expect. But this is hard to stop watching. It's gripping. And they picked the right actor to play the psycho king. Worth watching.
"""The Tudors"" is unlike any television show ever broadcast. The series is wonderfully produced with a huge budget, the acting is worthy of Oscars, and the story, although told before, is presented here fresh and is excitingly original. This 10 episode series dramatizes the life of King Henry VIII of England and his attemmpts to have a male heir for his dynasty as well as the international problems that beset him. The first season details the King's attempts to divorce his wife, Katherine of Aragon, and his lust for Anne Boleyn. The series is racy with many explicit sex scenes, but what makes ""The Tudors"" work are its strong scripts and the acting by its leads, most notably Jonathan Rhys Meyers who portrays Henry not only as a hungry sexual predator, but a man who loves his country and his people. The series won many Emmy nominations, most notably one for Meyers, for his soaring portrayal. ""The Tudors"" is beautifully produced, with amazing costumes and sets that add to the lustre of the series. In all four seasons worth of episodes will been made with seasons 2 and 3 available on DVD (season 3 comes out on DVD in early 2010)."
King Henry VIII to me will always be remembered for having 6 wife's and beheading  two of them. And for being  was a religious nut that forced others to think like him or be burned alive.
Great opening season into history of Henry VIII. First establishing key members of his court. Introduction of different historical players. Not sure hoe close if follows history but interesting.
"Not English history, buy very enjoyable.Buy all the seasons -- you won't regret it."
"This is the 6thseason in the shield series. 1st if you have never seen the shield, its a very gritty, raw and dark show. Its a story about a strike team in who pushes the laws beyond the legal limit. If you like cop shows you need ton see this."
"I reviewed Season 5 in detail but I will tell you that if you like cop shows be prepared for some dirty cops in this one, even though they have a good side also.  Vick and his crew go about catching the bad guys with no holds barred and there is no such thing as PC to them.  They do, however get the job done where others would probably not.  Absolutely the best cop show my wife and I have ever watched."
Vic Mackey is one of the most real characters in TV police work.  I'll be sad to see the end of this season and the last one end
The hardest part about watching these episodes is knowing that this is the next to the last Season in the series.
"The Shield is one of the best tv show ever! It is super intense. This show has a lot of violence, nudity and language so definitely for a mature audience."
"At the time this show took you by the throat and shook you like a rabid dog. Others have followed now, but this show got people pto pay attention to what the &#34;real&#34; world is like and moved away from cliched, saccharine sweet, happy ending, sycophantic melodrama and brought us, kicking and screaming, into a new age of TV drama.If you havent wanted the series .... All I can say is batten down the hatches, fasten your seat belt and enjoy the ride!"
A really great show. One of the best cop dramas ever made. Way better than the Sopranoes. All seasons of this show were good. This one was very good. This is a show that always has you wanting more and it comes through. A must buy series!
In this season Vic is trying to be as good as he can and not pull his usual crooked methods. The writing is still very good for an adult show. while my wife does not like the show I am enjoying every episode........when she is gone.
"Great job by Michael Chiklis and Walton Goggins.  This series was so good, I watched the first four seasons in a short period of time.  I am savoring the seasons left and watching them once a week."
"The Shield: Season Sixwas Shawn Ryan's real farewell to his ne'er do well Strike Team: when Shane (Walton Goggins) puts a grenade in Curtis Lemansky's (Kenny Johnson) lap out of fear he may be an informant, it's all grisly cliffnotes from thereon out. The demented, righteous and corrupt Lt. Kavanaugh (played uncomfortably well by Forrest Whitaker) succeeds with the help of Acevada to put Lemansky in a position that is completely untenable: go to jail and possibly be killed by Antwon Mitchell (Anthony Anderson) or flee to Mexico and face the same fate as Vic's semi mentor, Ben Gilroy.We see Vic's psyche begin to defenstrate as he can find neither rhyme nor reason to Lemansky's sudden Salvadoran gang style death, and boy, when Vic's psyche begins to defenestrate, EVERYONE'S in trouble.  His ability to lie and delude himself to satisfy his own emotions--in this case, revenge--is demonstrated to such a terrifying pitch by Michael Chiklis that one cannot help but wonder why Ronnie Gardocki (David Rees Snell) didn't become his own man in time.Lemansky was the glowing nucleus of the Strike Team, the man with ethics enough to keep Vic and Shane's putrid souls alive with some measure of joy and balance them out a bit.  What is worse than his grisly death, perhaps, is the discovery that another Strike Team member did it.  Dutch begins to come into his own as the Team fades, and since it's now only three people, Claudette gets more leverage.The introduction of Kevin Hiatt onto the team shows what *might have been* if Claudette herself was not corrupt--since Vic is on the verge of losing his badge, she could have hired him as the head of the Strike Team, but she chooses Vic because of his animalistic street smarts.  Never once was this show boring; never once monotonous; every episode blisters with meaning, commentaries on the human condition and everything else within a very short time frame, which is why I rank it as superior to the Sopranos and The Wire."
"I own all seven seasons of the Shield. Season six has good episodes that helped build you up for the final season seven, but doesn't give you any clue that things will end the way they do. The series stays fresh even after Season Five which could have ended the series (which I think was the best besides the First season which got me hooked on  this TV show)I don't think anyone should just purchase only one season of this series, even though all were good in different ways."
Keeps you wanting to see more and more I just finished season 7 was a great series wish there was more.
I gave it this rating because of how this TV series was setup and how it keeps you involved into the series.
"Caution: Spoilers ahead (although I personally believe that most of the people who read the reviews on this series are fans, not newcomers).The Shield: Season Fivewas a shocker...while Season One opened with the details of Vic Mackey killing Terry Crowley, there's an unspoken ethic in this realm of Terry being a ""rat""...yes, Vic killed a fellow cop, ""but""......the same can't be said of Shane's grenade toss and the death of Lem. It was a senseless death, uncalled for...Lem spent most of the fifth season coughing up blood and drinking Pepto Bismol over the stress caused by his decision to ""take one for the team.""But in the world of all great Shakespearean tragedies / Greek dramas, it was the necessary catalyst for Shane's ultimate fate in the final season.In Season Six, we also get Vic's Stike Team ""replacement,"" Kevin Hyatt. I think we pretty much know coming out of the gate that Hyatt is a weasel (as is more than abundantly evident from his post-one-night-strand behavior with Paula Garces' officer Tina Hanlon, but we also see it much earlier in the season). We also see the irony of Forest Whitaker's ""Kavanaugh"" meeting his final downfall for becoming Vic in order to take down Vic, and Wyms (CCH Pounder) fall to the same behavior as she lies to Vic upon Hyatt's entry in order to keep him on board in his final days, believing he has a chance at keeping his job (he doesn't). It's the same behavior, but Kavanaugh falls and Wyms rationalizes her actions. In the final season, Vic has the last laugh...sort of.In short, virtually every member of the cast makes an ill-conceived, fateful decision in this season, leading up to the Season Seven climax. A lesser show could be accused of manipulative scripting, but when it comes to The Shield...with the benefit of hindsight...these were all carefully considered, logical moves.A powerful season no matter how you look at it."
"Vic is back, baby! I'm certainly an unapologetic fan of this show primarily because it's a study of a well-written, character-driven offering.Avail yourself (if haven't already) to this bubbling cauldron of people being people - while not always pretty or flattering - that is fairly ""real."" Sure, I like Law & Order but it's a little too tidy and ""TV"" for me sometimes while The Shield is right on the cusp of non-premium Cable edginess. Any Shield fan or crime drama junky will not be disappointed."
Season 6 is very intense and full of suspense.  This series has been excellent and season 6 is know exception.  It gets pretty gruesome with murder and mayhem being the norm.  This season is a real love/hate  relationship between all the favorite actors in the series because the plot begins to change and becomes thick with evil doings and secrets found out with revenge being the name of the game.
I HAVE TO ASK MYSELF CONTINUALLY IS CHIKLIS JUST ABOUT THE BEST ACTOR I HAVE EVER SEEN? HOW IS IT THAT HE CAN IMBUE A TRULY HEARTLESS CRIMINAL WITH JUST ENOUGH HUMAN QUALITIES TO MAKE ONE KEEP HOPING THINGS WILL GET BETTER FOR HIM? ALL THE ACTORS ARE REALLY GOOD AND THE SCRIPT'S TWISTS AND TURNS KEEP THE TENSION BOILING.
wow i loved this series it was jammed pack with action. i can't believe it is over hopefully they will have another great series like it
"The Shield is one show with great stories, very good acting. This show is for adults.I recommend this show. The Shield contains violence and sex."
I gave this show 5 starts. It keeps you wanting to watch more. I finish watching all 7 seasons in a month. It is addicting.
Have enjoyed the unexpected turns that this series takes - very unexpected - which keeps my interest! Have enjoyed watching it all in order!
"I have always marvelled at the writing staff on THE SHIELD.If you've watched it from Season One til now, you've had to be amazed at the explosive twists and turns of the ongoing plots swirling around Vic Mackey and his Strike Team.  Somehow the writers have never written themselves into a corner--and I was certain they had in the early seasons!When this show began, I was in no mood for another cop show.  The friend who pushed the Season One DVDs on me assured me that this show as worth checking out.  I've been a fan ever since.I saw Michael Chiklis on ""The O'Reilly Factor"" and Bill O'Reilly brought up the comparison of THE SHIELD with THE SOPRANOS.  They're both critically-acclaimed crime shows about seriously flawed men on different sides of the badge.  As much as I've loved the first three seasons of THE SOPRANOS, they just never got their groove back from Season Four on.  People are still griping about that controversial ""cut to black"" finale.But THE SHIELD has hit the high marks every season.Love the cast, love the stories, love the show.  (Make sure you watch it from the beginning though: it's worth the ride)."
"The Shield - wherein it is proven that nothing elevates a TV drama to a place above daytime soaps more than graphic violence, profanity and gore combined with corrupt cops, grotesque pimps, ho's galore, violent mobsters of all ethnic varieties, rapes and pillage. Throw in a generous bunch of victims and perps, both repulsive and sympathetic, and you get an excellent drama that will satisfy all your voyeuristic needs. Good writing plus good acting plus good production values create a memorable series. If you can imagine Elmore Leonard and James Ellroy collaborating on The Wire and dropping it into the ethnic cauldron of Los Angeles, you'd get The Shield."
I have submitted comments on previous seasons of 'The Shield' and I continue to recommend this very entertaining and raw TV series!W.J.Milton
It was a shame to see this series come to an end.
"THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOB HOPE COLLECTION, MOVIES THAT ARE FUN.I'D RECOMMEND FOR ANY AGE GROUP"
"Did women really wear their hair this way in 1966. That sight alone on two of the lead females was worth the price of admission. The guys, too, while not quite matching the girls in quaintness to 2010 eyes, came in a close second with those shrunken fedoras they sport throughout.Starting with these laughs which were unplanned when the film was made, there are many more in this Bob Hope vehicle, which relies more on old-fashioned slapstick than on the typical Hope gags. While having little more to do than show her body, deliver a few accented lines, and be somewhat manhandled in closeups unsuitable to a stunt double, Elke Sommer still more than earned her pay by just being second banana to Hope. Phyllis Diller, a frequent support player to Hope in his various comedy venues in those years, does her particular thing well. True she was an acquired taste, as they say, but in this film, she does provide some fun. The remainder of the supporting cast do what is required of them to give the star his laughs. Hope, himself, nearing the end of his film career, has better material and, therefore, more laughs than some of the other films he made as it became only a marginal activity to being America's favorite comic here and abroad. At this time, he had something like one-third of the twenty all time hit shows on TV with his specials devoted to his entertainment of the troops, most recently in Viet Nam, where a bitter struggle was rapidly escalating.So for many good laughs, no irony or wit, no character development, no symbolic meanings, a story line just strong enough to carry the sight and sound gags, I can, still laughing, recommend this as feather-light, totally escape, viewing."
I really enjoyed the series with a mix of detective and personal drama with some humor thrown in for a good mix.
&#34;NO KA OI&#34; in Hawaiian means &#34;Is the BEST ! ! &#34;Five stars to the writers and the cast.
I really love the cast of characters and how they interact.  Good actors and interesting stories.  Having humor mixed in is great.
"THE writing on t his show is awesome,great care and skill to keep it authentic and the actors are extremely good.The story line always  t interesting.."
"I love The Closer and this DVD set does not disappoint. Great show, great value!"
Each season gets better and better while developing the characters and the characters' relationships.  Love the show and still enjoy watching it multiple times.
"This show grows on you and will instantly become one of your favorites.  This season is the best by far.  The cast is amazing but of course the show is carried by the excellent performance of Kyra Sedgwick.  Wow.  To see Brenda lee Johnson working over a suspect to get a confession using her skill, creativity and intelligence is television at its best.This is the glue that holds the show together but this 3rd season also brought us more into Brenda's personal relationship with Fritz and also with her parents.  Both are very enjoyable, inventive aspects to add yet even more dimensions to the character that is Brenda Lee Johnson.The subjects are timely and very interesting.  All I can say is I watch this show on the edge of my seat and find it to be of the highest caliber compared to other shows out there."
I was late to start watching the Closer on tv and no sooner did I find that it is a great show than it was in it's last season.  So I am so glad to be able to buy the season's I missed.  I go through Amazon on my Roku and the whole thing is just great.  It's a good show to watch and Amazon and Roku make it easy to obtain and watch.  Before then I was buying dvd's and they were over running my house.
"We love &#34;The Closer&#34;.  A terrific cast, excellent writing, engrossing procedural.  Too bad they through in a little too much &#34;fluff&#34; towards the end of the series (we don't think Brenda's mother and father added anything to the plots).  But we watch the episodes over and over again."
"The Closer is one of the best shows on tv.  Keira Sedgwick is great, but the entire cast ensemble has wonderful chemistry."
Awesome show with great story telling and humor. Really enjoy seeing how each character develops from season to season and conflicts abound in each episode. It is a captivating show.
"I very much enjoyed, season 3 and all of the seasons I have watched so far. It is a program worth watching."
"Once you've started, you'll find it hard to stop.  Watching these great videos is like a narcotic.  You just want to be injected with another one, and another.  Then when they are all done you have to go through a withdrawal phase of disappointment that there aren't another 100 to go.Great fun, edge of your seat humor and drama combined.  Every actor fits the part perfectly and the bad guys are bad and the dead people are really dead. The star, Kyra Sedgwick, is outstanding and never lets you down."
"Didn't start watching this show when it originally aired until the middle of Season #5.  I started watching it from the beginning on Amazon Prime.What an awesome show.  Kyra Sedgwick rocks.  If you've never seen it before, it's worth paying the cost for Amazon Prime,  Don't miss it!!"
"The series continues with the same format, a crime with a few dead ends and personal lives that continue to grow in different directions.  Yet, the series grows on you.  Each of the members of her elite homicide squad all detectives face life with laughter, tears, anger, and joy keep you hooked in the LA Police's back-story - keeping you wanting more."
"the characters are great, like the story lines, the southern &#34;charm&#34; can be a little much but that's what it is.............."
One of the best shows ever on tv. It's not the same without Kyra. I bought all 7 seasons! The Closer offers pretty much everything!
this  series deserved all the accolades for it remains reviting season after season with excellent character developmentand many plot variations so one never tires of viewing.  Kyra never stops being very much female while being an excellent leader with her team.  A very enjoyable series.
"This was one of my favorite TV shows to watch on TNT on Monday nights. What's best about The Closer are the characters we all love starting with Brenda Lee Johnson with that Georgia drawl, her flirtatious affair with FBI Fritz Howard and as ever the priority crimes team led by wise cracking senior detectives Flynn and Provinza. (I miss all those snappy one liners Provinza came up with on the Closer---the pair are more serious on the new Major Crimes...it's just not the same)Lt. Tao who is computer savvy and loves all the high tech stuff, Buzz who does all the crime scene video taping and prisoner interrogation's, Lt. Sanchez who always refers to his fellow officers as &#34;sir&#34;, and the rest of the crew. This was a top notch series, with great acting, well written snappy story lines, and was always very entertaining. I always loved the episodes when Brenda's parents visited and they always fit in Christmas episodes during the holiday season. Watching the series on instant stream I get to enjoy all the wonderful episodes all over again. I recommend this series to everyone. This was a summer fill in on TNT that turned out to be so successful that I think it really helped TNT launch other high quality weekly TV series."
"These series are well written with outstanding acting.  I like the fact they have been able to hold the cast together, as well.  I would recommend them to anyone that likes mystery, drama and police business."
I have loved this show from the start.  With Prime I am able to go back and review all seasons in case I missed any.  Really sorry there are no new seasons.
"Just keep this series coming. We love it and didn't find it until after 3 were made and the fourth just about out. We fell in love hook line and sinker. Well acted, well written, well produced and ok the cat's just so darn cute. Keep them funny or make more funny ones. Not as happy with the serious ones though it's ok now and again just don't go there too often. Secret they developed a cast that plays off each other as in real people relationships. Works for them and works for the fans. More more more. More kitty too....perhaps....meow...."
Love this show. Love every character. These are seasons that will be great to watch over and over for fans of the show.
"The premiss of this show is very close to that of Prime Suspect. I don't really care because it is a good show. I like the actors and the chemistry between them, even the negative chemistry. Definitely worth watching."
"I had never seen it from the beginning, so watching alll 7 seasons was a real treat!!! Helped pass all the snowy winters we have in northern Micigan....thanks Prime Video"
Fabulous!! Another great season. THe only negative would be that there isn't enough episodes!! By the time you are finished watching the last episode you have to wonder how the poor woman survived this season!! Can't wait until next season!
I own all 7 seasons of the Closer and watch and re-watch (is that a word?) them all the time.  I bitterly regret that the series only ran for 7 seasons.  The Closer is brilliant.
"I love they way she reels them in and lowers the hammer! That, mixed with a love for chocolate and a southern acdent."
"I 'enjoyed the entire series of this show, and thought it would be around ten series before it ended.' but, I still have hopes that something great will develop when the show puts all the 'main players back into play, and hopefully will show a new vision for the series with even more powerful females in leadership roles."
This program illustrates humor in uniform.  The interactions of the actors creates a synergy that just works.  We certainly enjoy this pergram
"Love the series and interaction between characters. Want to be entertained with a clean and thoughtful plot line? Watch The Closer, all series."
The Closer Season 3 is 5 stars.  I recently found this show and I'm hooked.. I am however sad the show is over.  I love that fact there is comedy and drama.  Thank you ... Thank You SO much.. lol
"I missed this series the first time around, watching one or two episodes.I'm wading through all the episodes on my Kindle Fire and enjoy the dramatic and, sometimes, comedic plots of this interesting show. The characters are a pleasure to watch and the show was very well produced. And the commercials......don't miss those at all."
"I'm enjoying the series.  wish the last two seasons were on &#34;prime&#34;  as of now, I'm watching all the seasons on &#34;prime&#34; for the second time."
It is so great to see a headstrong woman following her own personal convictions in order to get the criminal confessions needed to prosecute.  I love the way she comes up with ways around things by finding &#34;loop holes&#34; when promising not to prosecute and then has the FBI prosecute instead thereby keeping helr word.
I didn't think the series could get any better but this season was better than the first 2.  So much more of the characters and the stories got even better.
"The third season has a lot of change in store for Brenda Johnson (Kyra Sedgwick). SPOILERSFritz proposes and Brenda has a mysterious ailment that makes her emotions go bananas for awhile. The Third season of ""The Closer"" is among the best to date particularly with the two two part episodes. ""Til Death Do Us Part"" is a complex mystery that doesn't provide easy answers for Brenda and her crack Priority Homocide Division. Many of the characters in the show also face change including a possible forced retirement for Lt. Provenza.The set has a nice transfer with solid colors and an anamorphic widescreen transfer. The extras although not overwhelming great are solid but then you really aren't buying this for the extras are you? We get a good featurette that talks about the art of interrogation where police officers discuss how they often get confessions and how they have to do the exact roleplaying that we see on the show. We also get deleted scenes for a number of episodes as well as a gag reel. Unfortunately there aren't any commentary tracks (the strong two part episodes would have been perfect for commentary tracks since they are both the most complex and, in the case of ""Next of Kin"", comedic (Brenda, Fritz, Provenza and a suspect have to travel cross country to return to L.A. during the Holidays with Brenda's amusing parents).I did run into a glitch with the second disc where the disc was either defective or there was a problem during the transfer where ""frames"" are skipped during an entire 10 minute segment (although the dialog is fine).As with the previous seasons the writing, direction and acting are top notch better than a lot that we see on regular network TV. A great series continues to get better with the third season of ""The Closer""."
I never watched it when it was on TV so I am really enjoying watching all of them now. I really like the main character and how Kyra Sedgwick portrays her.
I bought this movie simply because I love old Cary Grant movies.  I took a chance and I'm glad that I did. What a great movie this was and it made me seriously consider becoming a foster parent.
"I am a huge Cary Grant fan, I thought I'd seen all of his movies, and today, this gem came to my attention. I sure miss the values, the love and the care for one's family and neighbors as depicted in this movie. I was born in the 60's, so I remember scouting, and the morals and values that were taught. I remember friendly neighborhood children, riding bikes and going to the beach.I didn't expect to get choked up watching this, but I did, as well as laugh out loud at times. This story is about a family with a heart for children. They bring two children who are living in orphanages, into their homes. The transformation that love, discipline, and a home can cause on even the most devastated child. How I wish things could go back to the way they were. I know it wasn't as idyllic as is shown in movies, but I definitely miss those days. I'd give this 10 stars if I could!"
"I have enjoyed Eureka thoroughly.  They have a great cast of characters, it is humorous at times, awesome at others.  I think its well done, and I am not a big fan of syfy.  You should watch it, you'll enjoy it.  Nice break from the usual TV fare!!"
"Eureka is a great series that, since its in a area 51setting, anything can and does happen."
"Totally enjoyed Season 2. The DVD shipped fast however,one of the disks was loose and has signs of some rubbing during shipment. The DVD played fine with no glitches so all is good."
"""Eureka - Season Two"" picks up right where the first season left off, and the events of the previous season color the story and plot lines. The characters have also better settled into their parts in this season, making the interactions much more enjoyable. The acting, writing, and special effects are very good (perhaps even better than the first season).This is a smart and funny series that we watch with the entire family. Highly Recommended!"
"This series was very well done on all levels.  It was excellent escapism entertainment in that I could always depend on the story line to be happily resolved.  Everyone of the characters were believable, and mostly likeable.  There is no crime to having a formula that leaves the audience wanting more.  The writers did a good job, the actors did a good job, the content was interesting, and the plot was fun."
It's nice te see a series thats fun to watch some of the things re far fetched but that's the fun parts
One of the best shows on cable. Not only was it funny but in a way educational as well. Too bad SYFY canceled it.
Eureka is a fun series and this is before everything gets complicated.  Enjoy these early episodes and recognize the hints and subtle plot develop lines.
"Although this season of Eureka did not have a particularly strong story arc that carried throughout (the questions of ""the artifact"" are never answered in a satisfactory manner), it really doesn't matter. The show is just so much fun to watch! It's the strength of the characters that makes it shine- Sheriff Carter, Deputy Lupo, Fargo, Zoe, Alison, Stark, and of course, Henry Deacon. It's a delight to see the chemistry that occurs between all these well written characters, as they attempt to save the town of Eureka from a new crisis each episode. Sure, it's pretty formulaic, but that's part of what makes it so good... it's familiar, and comforting, and the formula just plain WORKS.Unfortunately, the resolution on this DVD is not very good (it's old technology, after all), and it's not available on Blu-ray. But if you can stream it from Netflix in HD, it looks fantastic."
"Eureka has outstanding actors cast perfectly in their roles, and what great roles. The situations the script has them in have me laughing out loud! I find myself eagerly forwarding to the next act!"
"If you liked or didn't like &#34; Eureka&#34;, I'm not going to review it, you already know what you liked about it. I enjoyed the whole series. I have a couple of favorite episodes from Season 2. I like having the disks. Cable and internet service goes out from time to time, so it's nice to pop in the dvds and watch on my Sony portable. I was glad they ditched the funky potato foam of the 1st season package. This one holds the dvds correctly in place. The box is not going to fill up the landfill, it's going to remain with me for a long time to come, and then it will become a collectible, right?"
I had never heard of this show until I signed up for Amazon Prime and started watching it on Prime instant video.  I fell in love with the show and the characters.  I am really very sad that they have cancelled it.  I could watch it for hours every day and never get tired of it.  It seems like every show I ever find that is an interesting quality show they have to cancel  I'm sure there are a lot more sci-fi fans out there that are upset about this.  Here's wishing they would bring it back!!
This season is a great follow up to season one.  The show continues to be fun and engaging.  I have been mini marathon viewing 2-3 episodes a day and have not gotten tired of it yet.
Eureka is the best show on television. I buy each season to have and watch whenever I like. The storylines and the actors are first rate.
"Eureka gets even better in it's second season, we get more of the fargo character and the stark character is still around. He goes in the third season and his presence is missed by many.  The show remained true to it's premise and it still does,  with lots of crazy science related disasters affecting people with usually sheriff Carter's quick thinking to get them out of the mess in some form or another.  Eureka is so engaging because it's a great place , filled with great characters and it's the kind of place that one would hope does exist somewhere in some form. The dvd's have deleted scenes and other features too. The picture quality is excellent and the series comes in a good case as far as I can tell.  This is a good family scifi show that can appeal to anyone who likes a great tv show. the only downside is that scy fy hadn't yet figured out that they should make more than 13 eps a season with this one. ( wharehouse 13 too). If it's your biggest hit then give us more of it!  which thankfully they do in season 3 and four of eureka!  But the show is endearing and fun and is worth watching with someone you like because they'll like this show too."
"You can't go wrong on this series. It is truly excellent. It has been a long time since a new Sci-fi as fantastic as this one and one which has not been dumbed down for a change. This is a technology buffs dream come  true. Plus it is a clean, wholesome program for the entire family. It never fails to engage your attention and teach you something new using technologies so advanced, it is new to all of us. Every episode has been wonderful. The interaction between the cast members has been magic. Congrats to the person who selected the cast.It was a stroke of genius to start their new series in July each year. Eureka was the only game in town as far as new TV programs at that time of year. Seems none of the other Cable channels have caught onto the fact that we also watch TV in the summer.We are happy to see Henry back to normal. The writers had almost ruined his character between the dark moody scripts and changing hairdo's. Henry is one of their main characters whether they like it or not. His many talents make him a multifaceted character which never fails to surprise us.Oddly, I thought I never liked the character of Stark until they killed him off last Tuesday in a real tear-jerker ending. Now the show seems empty without his egocentric abilities. A key necessity in such a lab of high tech covert projects. I liked it better with him in it. They need to bring him back... perhaps by finding out that he was thrown into the future rather than deleted.I know shows will get rid of expensive actors and trade them for a couple lesser actors.... but the trade-off of Stark for Thorne and the new sister of the Sheriff are not even close to the same caliper as Stark and neither adds anything to the series. The new additions are just excess baggage. It would be no loss if they both disappeared.As far as Thorne's trimming of the employees role... The gov't has never cared about how much tax money they waste..and they don't usually lay off their black project scientists... so her coming in and acting like it is a private corporation needing to be slimmed down makes no sense.Not to mention why the Sheriff's sister would be allowed to be in a closed town filled with black project employees and scientists who use classified products out in the open.This looks like an early attempt to cut costs. In the corporate world, you're allowed to show a loss on your taxes for 3 years. After that, they lose the tax breaks so most new companies will start trimming employees between year 2&3 and will usually pick their highest salaried employees to cut and try to replace them with someone cheaper... unfortunately, they usually end up with someone who can't do the job... which is why they are cheaper to hire.They need to let the viewers decide on major cast and plot changes... not some pitbull exec in the network sales dept... like the ones who canceled Star Trek and Outer Limits.Let's hope some idiot in charge doesn't cancel or ruin the spirit of Eureka like they have managed to do in the past to every decent show. Especially those programs which are over the heads of those cable network goons. They need to remember that most viewers are not on Nielson and they are not getting accurate ratings from them. They should also be careful about allowing a sponsor to ruin the program with too much interference... and Degree is coming close to that point in just a few episodes this yearBut so far, Eureka is still a one-of-a-kind program which never fails to entertain and bring delight to the viewers."
"Watched all 5 seasons in about a month or so... whenever we were both home and able... it was super fun, quirky and just a good time. SOOOO sad to have it end but there were a lot of time travel, worm hole situations so I can bet it was getting challenging to keep it fresh! GREAT show!"
"Season 2 of Eureka was just as good as Season 1. The writing was tighter, the acting was smooth. There were a lot more one off plot driven shows rather than multi-episode story arcs but very enjoyable. I highly recommend the entire run and Season two is a fine addition to both your collection and the show."
I enjoy the fanciful science and the character interactions.  The actors are good and the stories are just plain fun.  They are the kind of shows I like to watch more than once.
We watch Eureka over and over and over.  One of the best shows for us to fall asleep to while watching on the iPad.  Just enough comedy and science to make it funny and not all the heavy drama that most Sy-Fy shows want to include.  Never understood how this show would be cancelled and Warehouse 13 'replaced' it...no comparison.  Oh well..guess that's enough words for now.
my husband and I  really have been enjoying this show just found out about it from our grandkids and have had fun watching it
EACH STORY IS GOOD TO WATCH. IT WILL KEEP YOU LAUGHING. AS WELL AS TRYING TO FIGURE WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT.
I love this show!  I can't wait to get to the next episode to see what they come up with next.
Love the writing for this show and the ideas they present.  A must see!! Definitely add to your watch list now.
The unique story line continues in season 2.  Jack Carter keep things in perspective by layman standard as usual. A perfect straight man in town full of mad scientists... I loved it.
"I like this show, Sheriff Jack is super handsome. The story is cute.  I wish there were more seasons of this show because it is super addicting.  It isn't too stuffy like a lot of sci fi shows.  It is set in our time I like that too."
"I really like this series. everyone works well together. if you like comedy with some drama thrown in, you'll love this."
"Life is complicated. This story line is clever and serves that  truth well.I like the idea that Angels can be like ordinary, overworked people.The character Holly Hunter portrays is &#34;Grace&#34; itself. She is her own worst enemy, drinking and sleeping with various people, yet committing her precious time on earth to bringing justice to, and for those who have been wronged.In spite of her endless rotations of addiction to work, sex and alcoholic drink, she makes deep commitments to her detective team, so they may help serve justice to victims of life and circumstance.Then along comes an Ordinary Angel that attempts to open the window to Grace's soul. The question becomes; will Grace respond to the bumbling ways of the Angel and find a way to save herself?  Cool ideas!"
"Series Creator: ""Nancy Miller"" penned a nice semi-hard hitting TV version of a La Femme Nikita with severely rough edges Oaklahoma Police Dept. Detective that has fallen under the watchful graces of an Angel assigned to provide the Detective with a second chance at redemption for all of the dimwitted, narrow-minded, self destructive decisions she's made.Nicely done, almost different and indifferent to the usual Playmate Bunny types depicted in commercial Television dramas, petite ""Holly Hunter"" manages to drive this series forward with a Napolean complex hellbent on rough-housing anything, and anyone that gets in her way. While the themes are adult oriented, the nature and style is more akin to the whimsy of teenage boys--with enough preadulescent attraction for Tomboy girls--to offset oncoming hormonal desires, which makes ""SAVING GRACE"" highly entertaining viewing for the youth of my soul...  GBJ"
"One of the best new series to come along, within the realm of &#34;The X-Files&#34; and &#34;House&#34; - and, unfortunately, this show ended all too soon."
"Too bad it was cancelled...it is raw in your face, sometimes brutal, dark but also funny!  Holly Hunter is a gas."
"A REALLY FUN SHOW, EVERYONE SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY, CANT'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT SEASON"
"This is an enjoyable Psych episode that pretty much follows the show's normal format of flashbacks and improbable coincidental occurrences, and it works well. We like Psych and tend to watch the older episodes on Netflix over theRoku 2 XS 1080p Streaming Player, but this episode wouldn't stream so we bought it on Amazon since it was the next in the series.No spoilers from me: This is a Christmas themed episode that has Gus and Shawn going to Christmas dinner at Gus' parents house where Shawn tries to impress Mr. and Mrs. Guster, but things don't go too well when a neighbor is found murdered.Sometimes the acting is a little over the top and often boarders on downright silly, but it is a very clever and fun show.Highly Recommended!CFH"
"The item was just as described.  Also, I really enjoyed watching the DVD's -- I would recommend that everyone buy a copy of Psych Second Season!"
Never get tired of Psych. I want all seasons.
"Without a doubt, Shawn Spencer is the public's favorite fake fictional psychic detective. Of course as far as I know, he's also the only one.But that doesn't stop the second season of ""Psych"" from being a rollicking good time, full of crazy schemes and baffling murder mysteries. James Roday and Dul&eacute; Hill actually become even more entertaining, with less slapstick and more of a reliance on eccentric plot twists, pop culture references, and crimes that get ever weirder.Shawn (Roday) and Gus (Hill) get swamped by reality pop culture when American Duos comes to Santa Barbara. The cruel British judge Nigel St. Nigel (Tim Curry) hires them to protect him, because he thinks that someone is trying to kill him.A live wire and a poisoned sandwich later, Shawn agrees -- especially when a drugged-out female judge almost dies. But out of all the people who loathe Nigel, which one tried to kill him? Then the police suspect that Shawn has lost his touch when he announces that someone was killed by a dinosaur, and is confronted by a sexy FTD psychic.But that isn't the last or least of Sean and Gus's problems -- a chop shop with secrets, bounty hunters, Gus's parents accused of Yuletide murder, jockey deaths and fixed races, nanny-related robberies, electrocutions on the catwalk, and going undercover at a telenovela, a school for the gifted, and a retirement community. They even have a run-in with a wealthy, crazy woman that Gus drunkenly married on spring break years ago... and it turns out her new fiancee is a bit shady.Finally, Shawn and Gus are pursuing one of their weirdest cases ever. First a security guard is suspected of stealing a 3000-year-old mummy -- but then it appears that the mummy actually murdered the guard. Can Shawn figure out what is going on -- with the mummy murder, the police chief, and his oddly-behaving father?Although it didn't break much new ground, the first season of ""Psych"" was very fresh and entertaining TV. Fortunately creator Steve Franks is sticking to the old adage: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it,"" and the second season doesn't deviate from what works -- there's still lots of comedy, spoofery, silly dialogue (""It's spontaneous psychic krav maga!"") and enjoyable mysteries.The first episode kicks things off a bit weakly, since the ""American Idol"" joke gets stretched out too far. Fortunately the mysteries after that get much more solid, deftly juggling even the funny-sounding plot twists (strangulation by mummy bandage? Refrigeration trucks?). You even get an endless parade of pop culture references, from Michael Jackson to ""Shaun of the Dead,"" James Bond to wikipedia.com. Gotta love that.But the best aspect of ""Psych"" continues to be its kooky dialogue. Usually Shawn provides it (""I hunger for the meatballs the way a jackal salivates for an injured possum""), but other characters get to as well (""Hola. Me llamo Inspector Carlton Lassiter. Me gusta queso"").Shawn and Gus remain an entertaining pair of twentysomething everymen, with Roday continuing to be eccentric, lovably charming and kooky -- although Shawn gets quite a shock in the cliffhanger ending. And Hill gets more attention, with Gus pursuing models and faking psychic powers. We even discover a secret past involving sweater vests, spring break, and a drunken wedding -- lots of fun.And the supporting cast remains solid -- Corbin Bernsen gets to participate in a couple of the cases as Shawn's hard-nosed dad, sometimes in loud tropical shirts. Timothy Omundson continues to be entertaining as harder-nosed cop Lassiter. And Maggie Lawson rounds off the cast as the ""enigma wrapped in a little blonde riddle"" who is Shawn's love interest, as well as a counterpoint to Lassiter.The second season of ""Psych"" continues the eccentric crimes and equally odd crimesolvers, mingling comedy and mystery with only a couple weak spots. Sweet black licorice!"
"""Psych"" is a hilarious show, and the second season improves upon the wonderful formula established in its first effort. Once again, this show is all about character, and the chemistry that exists between series stars Shawn and Gus is second to none, on any network or any show. It's a delight to watch these lifelong friends engage in their wildly inappropriate adventures as they attempt to solve mysteries that they really have no business getting involved in (not to mention the hilarious flashbacks to their childhood). Lassiter, O'Hara, and ""Dad"" all continue to shine, rounding out the wonderful cast of characters who each complement the show perfectly. Though every episode of these season is fun to watch, a couple of standouts for me were ""Gus' Dad May Have Killed an Old Guy"" and ""65 Million Years Off"" (in which Shawn accuses a T-Rex of murder!)."
"This season of Psych is great, the duo of Shawn and Gus are even funnier and have to solve even funnier cases. The character development between Shawn and Juliet is also furthered.I would definitely recommend this season to anyone looking for a good laugh."
"The season starts out with possible the best of the Psych episodes - American Duos. Tim Curry is brilliant, of course. 65 Million Years off, Bounty Hunters! (Kevin Sorbo!), Lights, Cameras...Homicido and Shawn (and Gus) of the Dead.And There's Something about Mira has the best line ever ""I should have been that goat!""The Chief takes on a larger role - and well played.Gus and Shawn continue to be their solid selves.My only minor complaints are Black and Tan: A Crime of Fashion"" - Shawn isn't good looking enough to be a model, but Gus is? Really? Also, the set up for the appearance of the mother. Could have lived without that"
"For the second season of this wonderful mystery/comedy show, the producers wisely left things pretty much alone.  Shawn Spenser (James Roday) comes from a long line of cops.  But he rebelled against his father's (Corbin Bernsen) wishes and didn't become a cop.  Instead, he pretends to be a psychic, using his finely honed observation skills to get the information for his ""visions.""  He's even opened Psych, a psychic detective agency with best friend Burton ""Gus"" Guster (Dule Hill).  And he has an impressive track record, much to the dismay of Detective Lassiter (Timothy Omundsun).  Rounding out the cast are Santa Barbara Detective Juliet O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) and Interim Chief of Police Karen Vick (Kirsten Nelson).And what a collection of cases they have this year, too.  Shawn and Gus join the TV sensation American Duos to find out who is trying to kill the head judge (played by Tim Curry).  They become models to find out who killed both partners of a fashion house.  Shawn must clear Gus' parents of murdering the neighborhood crank.  When Gus' uncle (guest star John Amos) comes for a visit, Shawn and Gus have to switch places, without the police figuring out that both of them are faking it.  Equally complicated is a case where a real psychic is brought in and Shawn must keep his secret from her.  Shawn puts his credibility on the line by claiming one victim was killed by a dinosaur.  And in the season finale, Shawn pins the crime on a mummy.This show has real come together and is firing on all pistons now.  The mysteries are tight and confusing.  I might piece things together a little before Shawn, but not by much.  And it doesn't matter because the entire fun is getting to the end.  The over the top physical humor has been toned down this year (and that's a good thing), but there is still plenty of laughs.  You've got cultural references spewed in mile a minute dialogue by Shawn and Gus, comedy from the character's relationships, comedy from the situations, and some physical humor.  I can't stop myself from laughing out loud while I watch this show.  And the cast does a great job holding it all together.  They bring high energy to each episode, but they keep it real.If you have missed this show, you have definitely missed out.  Don't let another day go by without becoming a fan."
this is a fun intro to these two crazy guys.  they are so silly and loveable. the characters are fun and well developed.
"I had just finished seeing the episode of Monk when they had just gave the announcement that this show was coming up next,  I had never seen the show before and decided to give it a try and now I am grateful to have made that choice.  The two characters Shawn Spencer(James Roday) the thirty-something son of a police officer who while having a photographic memory was taught by his father to remember immaculate minute details, and Shawn's best friend the more down-to-earth and responsible Burton 'Gus' Guster(Dul&eacute; Hill) decide after a misadventure with a crime and helping to solve it to open their own detective agency(Actually more of Shawn's idea).  The main gimmick is that Shawn uses his incredible deductive abilities as a somewhat scam pretending to actually be a psychic solving cases.  Whether or not the police believe him to be psychic his high solve rate lands him a position with the police department as their resident psychic.  The series is vastly hilarious and seeing some of the scenes that the two main actors do is amazing,  the most memorable for me from the first season is the season one episode finale Scary Sherry:Bianca's Toast believe me you'll laugh insanely seeing their antics on this episode. The show also has four other main cast to the show but of course you'll most of the time will try and keep up with Shawn and Gus.  The extras are also nice you have the gag reels, commentaries from the cast and producers, some deleted scenes, and see some adventures of Shawn and Gus when they were kids.  The video is widescreen and for the most part clear and sharp there are a few scenes where there is some graininess but those are mostly scenic scenes and not when the actors are in the shots.  So if you're looking for a change of pace from shows like C.S.I or NCIS here's a more comedic look at the crime solving efforts of are two favorite private psychic detectives..."
"It is great. Over and over again, I can watch these and I do. It is always a fun time."
Monk was a very good show. I have enjoyed all of the seasons and this was just as good as the rest. Very well done.
"This has been one of the funnier seasons I think.  The stories are quite good, a notch up from Season 5 I felt.  Overall the writing here feels as solid as Monk's ever been.  Some of the episodes are a little far-fetched (Monk on the Lam?), but what they may lack in beleivability, they surely make up for in creativity and comic value which serve as a nice added bonus to Monk's tweaked out heroics. Some funny episodes, my favorites probably being ""Mr Monk and His Biggest Fan"" which starts the season off with a bang, ""Mr Monk and the Naked Man"" where Monk confronts his taboos about nudity at a nude beach (this episode was almost deep), ""Mr Monk Joins a Cult"" (kind of silly but I liked the bizarreness of the whole scenario), and ""Mr Monk Paints His Masterpiece"" in which Monk's new hobby starts earning him good money! I can't think of any episodes that I didn't much like. This was a good season."
"Between Natalie's driving skills, the special appearance by Norman Bates, and confusion and mayhem between the Julies at the end - Wow.  HILARIOUS!!!!If you're a fan of Adrian Monk and you've never seen this episode and you want to laugh - this is THE episode to watch."
We see a lot of character development here as the series stretches and the story lines are still good.  Quite  worth your hard earned cash.
I have been a big fan of Monk since its first season. It just keeps getting better.
I'm a monk-a-holic for sure. I watch episode after episods and I get sad when I'm coming to the end of the season.I prefer Julie to the other assistant.
"Monk's 6th is just as hilarious and entertaining as the previous seasons. Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders, with the help of his devoted Assistant, Natalie. Throughout this season, Monk must deal with his crazed fan, help a rapper, teaches Julie Teeger about love, hang out with his psychiatrist's son, shoots Santa Claus, joins a cult, becomes a fugitive, and finally has a new lead in the murder of Trudy. I highly recommend MONK: SEASON SIX!!!"
Season six was another good season for Monk.  The two hour finale had me excited.  Monk is hilarious and Natalie is still keep things together.This is a must-see season!
"What happened was this.....spoilers ahead.......Mr. Monk tore through the sixth season with stronger emotions, even beating up a guy who had something to do with Trudy's death. Dale the Whale returned to try to torment Monk, who had to fake his own death for a while.  Also, Julie Teeger got more screen time as she blossomed into a teenager, while Randy Disher was given more attention as well.  The captain continues to maintain a strong presence on the show, and so does Natalie.  Dr. Kroger holds his own.I missed Monk's brother Ambrose, though."
"Sherlock Holmes, Columbo, Hercule Poirot -- genius detectives are usually a bit quirky. But no other is as quirky as Adrian Monk, the obsessive-compulsive detective -- and ""Monk: Complete Series "" compiles every episode of this funny, likable little mystery series. Tony Shalhoub shines as title character, solving the case with his gift/curse and his willingness to go anywhere... that doesn't have germs.Adrian Monk's wife Trudy was killed in a car-bombing, and the devastated detective fell apart completely. Years later, Monk (Tony Shalhoub) is partially recovered, but he still is obsessive-compulsive and has dozens of phobias. The only way he manages is with his assistant Sharona (Bitty Schram) -- and later her successor Natalie (Traylor Howard) -- babysitting him.Courtesy of his friend Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine), Monk is called in for dozens of bizarre, baffling cases. His excellent memory and his OCD (""It's a gift.... and a curse"") allow him to see patterns and details where other people see nothing.Among Monk's cases are going undercover at a prison, a killer dentist, a deadly Christmas gift, an elephant used as a lethal weapon, a billionaire mugger, saving Willie Nelson from a murder rap, trapping a black widow, the death of a 115-year-old man, the Mafia, garbage strikes, rock concerts, a cult, real estate, a murder on a sub, a voodoo curse, UFO sightings, martial-artists, murdered models, and a guy who leaped out of a plane -- and died by drowning.But as quirky and bizarre as the cases is, it never stops hitting the heartstrings. Monk becomes attached to a little boy and a murder victim's dog, and it's a credit to this show's writers that the ending of those episodes aren't maudlin or sappy. And he is still passionately devoted to his dead wife, and his quest for her killer is a story that stretches across the whole series.""Monk"" is the sort of show that usually gets cancelled after five episodes -- it's well-written, amusing, and smart. So by TV standards, lasting eight seasons is nothing short of miraculous. Like any long-running show it has its duds (""Mr. Monk Takes His Medicine"" always makes me cringe), but overall it's a brilliant series.There are gunfights and SWAT teams, like on any cop show, but the main focus here is on detecting. And the writers are skilled at coming up with all sorts of bizarre or unsolvable crimes, which only Monk could unravel. Not to mention the dialogue, which leans heavily on dry humour (""So you're saying the opposite of a spider is a tall building?"")But the series wouldn't be what it is without Tony Shalhoub. He played weird roles in movies like MIB and ""Galaxy Quest,"" and so he knows how to balance out Monk's weirdness and genius without leaning too heavily on either. When told to sit on the ground, he says nervously, ""I can't. Animals do things on the ground. Terrible, terrible things.""Schram and Howard are both good as his assistants, and they're similar without being TOO alike -- one was a hardened New York gal, and the other is a rebel rich girl with a checkered employment past. And Levine and Jason Gray-Stanford round off the cast as genial cop Stottlemeyer and his earnest (if slightly goofy) sidekick Disher.""Monk: The Complete Series"" shows us all of this excellent show, with its uniquely appealing hero. It's a gift... and a curse."
"I'm enjoying the Christmas marathon.  I have been laughing at each episode since I've started watching.  Monk is quirky, obsessive compulsive, intelligent, yet relatable.  All the characters are (relatable) - Randy is a hoot and Captain Stoddlemeyer is funny without meaning to be.Monk is educational.  After watching this series for years (I haven't seen all the episodes yet) I'm guessing how people died, cause of death, etc. by telltale clues.  Does this mean I should quit my day job?  Probably not quite yet, but in the meantime I'll visit the sites in the City as an homage to one of my favorite former, former, former police detective.PS - A good bonus is that this show isn't as gruesome as CSI (another favorite, but I admit, I can't watch brains leaking out of someone's skull without cringing)."
I love this series he makes me feel like a normal person.  This is fun series allowing you to enjoy the oddities of others with the ability to solve the crime.
"monk was a smash hit on tv for all of it's series. The show was followed by another hit 'psych' on the same network. Which gave that cable channel two really competitive hits. Monk didn't end it's run from bad ratings , instead fans were happy to see tony shaloub play this character for another 8 seasons. But he was tired of it so the show left the air with the central mystery finally solved. the early episodes featured bitty scram,  she was a excellent aide and did a great job as monks nurse aide. She wanted more money and was fired after a few series. this is a common mistake that many actors make. Only it's worse for women. roles for men are many. there's FAR less for women and a actress on a hit show shouldn't bail unless she has another real offer. this happened to terry farrel on 'becker' and she hasn't worked much sense. tony was well known for 'wings',one of the best of the 1990's sitcoms in the u.s. and a worldwide hit. You can see the show on reelz network in hd today. here he is the lead character and he creates a really sympathetic compulsive detective. ted levine is excellent as his friend capt stotelmyer. The second actress who plays the aide to monk also is engaging and did a fine job.  The whole series is still well lvoed , just like wings is and hopefully a reunion show is in the works for sometime in the future."
"Season 1- Monk is a hilarious and an incredibly entertaining series. Three years earlier, Adrian Monk's wife, Trudy was murdered by a car bomb. He has extreme O.C.D. and relies on his Nurse/Assistant Sharona to help him while he solves murders with Captain Leland Stottlemeyer, and Lt. Randy Disher. Throughout the season Monk investigates an assassination attempt on a Mayoral Candidate, goes to an asylum, takes a vacation, deals with an earthquake, helps prove the innocence of Willie Nelson, and much more.Season 2- Monk's 2nd is just as hilarious and entertaining as the previous season, perhaps even better. Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders, with the help of his Assistant, Sharona. Throughout this season Monk investigates a murder at Trudy's high school, goes to Mexico, help prove the innocence of Sharona's sister during a stage play, figure out why a paperboy is killed for the newspaper, gets married, goes to jail, and finally gets a new lead in the murder of Trudy.Season 3- This is probably my favorite season. During the course of this season, we say good-bye to Sharona Fleming and hello to Natalie Teeger. Monk investigates Warrick Tennyson's role in Trudy's murder, gets fired, helps an organized crime family, becomes a contestant on a game show, gets stuck in traffic, goes to Las Vegas, adopts a kid, and much more.Season 4- Throughout this season Monk returns home on HALLOWEEN, stays in bed because he's sick, gets drunk, goes to a fashion show, figure out who would want to poison Stottlemeyer at the Christmas party, gets amnesia, stop a killer astronaut, and figure out if Trudy Monk had faked her death.Season 5- Throughout this season Monk deals with a garbage strike, loses his eyesight, attends his college reunion, goes to a rock concert, finally meets his dad, goes on the air, and much more.Season 6- Throughout this season, Monk must deal with his crazed fan, help a rapper, teaches Julie Teeger about love, hang out with his psychiatrist's son, shoots Santa Claus, joins a cult, becomes a fugitive, and finally has a new lead in the murder of Trudy.Season 7- Monk is forced to find a new therapist because Dr. Kroger has died. Throughout this season Monk matches wits with a chess player, helps a boxer, gets stuck on a submarine underwater, meets his other brother, fights City Hall, and much more.The Final Season- In the end, all the pieces will fit together. Throughout this season, Monk serves as a bodyguard for his favorite actress, investigate a UFO sighting, goes undercover as a Mafia boss, celebrates his Birthday, receives a surprising visit from Sharona Fleming, and finally solves the murder of his wife, Trudy. It all comes down to this. This season felt a little rushed, but is the perfect ending to the Monk saga. I highly recommend MONK: THE COMPLETE SERIES!!!"
"I had to grab this Amazon deal!I started watching Monk during the ION Channel weekend marathons. The USA network has become known for it's great character driven shows.  Monk is another one of those characters that you immediate love and sometimes identify with. I love seeing how he develops through the show, coming to grips with his wife's murder and eventually solving it."
MUST HAVE!Doesn t get better than this.......unfortunately they stopped after 8 years!Maybe the most impressive acting in a long time......
"Just now catching up on this series. High end production values and very good story telling. As with all good sic-fi, it is about the human condition as much as it is about &#34;aliens.&#34;"
When I saw the remake of Battlestar Galactica I had the memories of the original show casting heavy doubt on the story being worth the time to watch.  After making it through the first two seasons on Prime Instant Video I can see that I should never judge a show by the quality of a previous one of the same name.  Other than the names being the same in some cases this show carries over nothing from the original and sets itself apart from most shows and takes us to a place far more intriguing than most any do.  I'm not sure what to expect from the remainder of season 3 and 4 but the by the end of 2 and beginning of 3 the story lines that had been set in place went into hyper speed and had more action in 5 episodes than many shows do their entire run.  The writers have no problem pushing the envelope of character development and change as circumstances move so fast it has left my head swimming and my interest peaked as for where they can go from here.  But if the first 2 seasons are any indication then I'll just have to hang on and enjoy the ride hoping the end is not a disappointment after a mind boggling first half.  If you like Science Fiction that pushes the limits of human behavior then you don't want to miss this show.
"Being the stuff of awkward nerds and Dwight from The Office, Battlestar Galactica was the farthest show from my list. But now, I'm hooked. Great character development, soundtrack and storyline. Love it."
"Season 2 had episodes that aren't all related to each other.  Each of these episodes is compelling in its own right.  It is in this season that we learn how complicated the Cylons are and we see each side in the war having setbacks.  The crew and human race is unable to follow their mythical script in a direct way, leading to a false start on New Caprica."
"Good stars, good casting of characters, good writers. All the things I want in entertainment. I do believe that the TV series writers are turning out far better work than the full length movie writers."
"Great story, excellent acting and character development. Great blend of drama and action, convincing effects. Of course no commercials on Amazon Prime."
"BSG is always good TV.  When in doubt, look to Tricia Helfer and Grace Park, two of the hottest women on TV.  The show, built on the premise of a pretty lame show really developed the characters over the seasons.Tricia Helfer is particularly amazing in her role as an angel to Guyus Baltar, Park does a tremendous job in her multiple roles...oh yea, the male cast members are pretty good.  This show took the BSG concept way beyond it's origins to a full blown series."
Awesome series so glad to have Amazon Prime so I can see those shows that I didn't have the time to watch.
"This was unlike any other &#34;space&#34; drama show, past or present.  It was a dramatic show that just happened to be set in space. All 4 seasons were awesome (I've watched the series from &#34;end to end&#34; many times and I never tire of it).  Whether you like sci-fi or not, it's worth every penny."
I like the characters and the plots are wonderful.  It definitely keeps you interested in what is happening and going to happen.
"The shows twist on life and religion to me is very interesting for people that like sci-fi shows & have not see this should give it a try .. So far in this season they are still trying to find the planet .. Which they never been too and they say, it's the best planet of them all .. Lol earth !! One things for sure this season as a lot of things happening .. But overall a great season .. (Season 2)"
"One of my favorite television series of all time along with 'The Wire'and 'Breaking Bad'.Like 'The Wire' this is a complex, Dickensian study of human nature,not afraid of asking big questions, and meticulously plotted like agreat novel, so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.Just as 'The Wire' used the overly familiar clich&eacute;' world of the copshow to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions, and 'BattlestarGalactica' uses the sci-fi series, and the idea of human versus robotwars the same way.This is thinking person's sci fi, in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke,or Isaac Asimov. It's about why we are how we are, what it means to bea human being, morality under constant pressure in times of war,fathers and sons, impossible loves, metaphors for modern and recentpolitics and real world situations.My wife, far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes, and we torethrough 5 years of shows in just a few days. It's that addicting.The acting is all at least quite good, and some cast members areremarkable, creating characters full of depth, complexity andcontradiction. The writing is terrific, allowing the characters tochange and grow, but always in ways that make sense, creating seeminglyinexplicable conundrums, only to find surprising, sometimes shocking -but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they'vetaken us. The special effects are generally very impressive for TV,even if they're not really why you watch this show.It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I've everseen, and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out andblown away. I was sad to get to the last episode, just as one is sad tofinish a great book.I haven't bought it in other forms, so I can't compare, but generallythe blu-ray set (the non-Cylon box) is quite complete, and well packaged.However, I have read accounts that quality control was a bit of a problemand I didn't escape the bugs. On a couple of my discs there wasa slight 'pulse' to the image at times. At first I thought perhapsit was a strange, but intentional, lighting effect, but looking at it carefullyit seemed more a reproduction problem.This isn't just the intentionally added grain, a look I don't love, but acceptas an artistic decision.Since then, I've read similar comments from others, so I'm not crazy(or at least not in this case!). So, if you do order this, you might wantto make sure it's returnable, and try to do a quick quality check the bestyou can. Of course, if the problem is intermittent, and mostly in the laterdiscs, as was in my case, by the time I saw it it was way too lateto ask for an exchange.None-the-less, for me, the quality of the content way over-rode theoccasional image problems (and I'm a perfectionist - my wifenever noticed the pulsing until I pointed it out.).As far as getting the individual seasons on blu-ray, it looks as thoughyou can do better buying the box set, although prices fluctuatequickly here on Amazon and elsewhere, so I'd advise you do the mathand figure out the most reasonable way to own the complete set.Also, Amazon UK currently has a complete region free blu-ray boxset for about $100 with shipping.  It seems to have all the same extrasas the US box set.  Well worth considering as long as the price holds up."
"Battlestar Galactica was a perfect series, and season two just exemplifies how great the story line progression is.  As the drama increases and bonds of family and friendship are tested, with great twists and turns watching just one episode will never be an option."
"If you thought the first season was gut wrenching and mind blowing, the second season one-ups the first.  Sex, drugs and rock and roll sum up the scenes from this season."
"Great cast, great concept, great long series you can immerse yourself in.  Interesting how some of the actors don't look nearly so good in other projects.Ending of series takes easy way out."
I am not a critic but have found this series very enjoyable.  This is so much better than the original series that it is simply a step up in entertainment.  A good way to fill in some winter and bad weather hours.
I watched the original Battlestar Galactica with Loren Green years ago but this one is so much better. Good si-fi  and a great cast of characters and story lines to keep the series interesting. I was hooked after season one and looking forward to season three.
"This is my second time watching season II of BSG...I cried. After Sharon was saved by Tyrol and Aggethon and she pulled the blanket over her head and cried, I cried also. This show is unbelievable and sooooooooo good. When was Cdr Adama made an Admiral! This show made me change my mind on interrogating prisoners, especially women. I know I will get slammed for this, but I don't care. I'm a woman first and foremost, and above all is. This show speaks to so much."
"I have already reviewed the series in Season !, and this season was a strong part of it.  Worth watching for people who really crave deeplly human stories."
"really good show, i love the way they dramatised there plight from the very first episode to the last episode the mini series was done great job."
"I purchased the entire seasons (1 - 4) and have found them both entertaining and worth the cost.  Over time, the re-watch high-lights the missing in-depth interactions of the characters, but also brings out details that might have been missed on the original broadcast. Again, I am biased becuase of being a fan of BSG."
"Every time a episode ends I can't wait to start the next one. This show is awesome,if you like scifi you'll really love this one."
"In  a way this Series seems to be about the ends days of our time, and hope after the battle is over. At least that's the impression I get."
I was hooked on the first episode of season 1. I love the characters. Even the music is great. Have you noticed the sounds of the ship and the size of the doors between rooms? Just what one would expect if one were on an actual spaceship. The most annoying thing though is the voice of Gaius Baltor. Makes my throat hurt listening to him.
"If you've not seen the newer Battlestar Galactica, you really should.  It is great Science Fiction.  Heck, it is just a great story, period!  This is a series best watched in &#34;binges;&#34; that is, watch an entire season in one week, preempting your normal TV viewing.  When you do that, it is much more like watching a movie, or a serial movie, than it is a TV series.  There's action, adventure, romance, war, life-or-death situations and decision, emergencies, subterfuges, blackmail, treachery, even treason!  Not to mention some of the prettiest Cylon models this side of the Galaxy.One could nitpick this little thing or that minor nuance...but hey, this is great television.  Enjoy it.One caution:  There are many scenes inappropriate for younger than 14, and more probably up to 17 or 18.  Even as an adult, I find myself keeping the remote in my hand to be able to fast forward through some of the spicier scenes.  That is the single negative critique I'd have of this series, and it is not a trivial critique.  The newer BG is NOT something to let your kids watch willy-nilly; just because the old series was PG-rated.Again, a very good show...just keep the remote handy."
I don't have a ton to say except I love this series. Period. Watch it from the beginning and you will not regret it.
"In this series, good characters are sometimes bad and show serious flaws and the worst characters demonstrate heroics.  The exodus from New Caprica introduces a new dynamic to the series with the added complexity of character flaws in everybody.  I didn't like some of it but was always captivated."
Season Three continues right where season 2 left off at.  With the Cylon occupation in full force and the pressure being on for the colonists of New Caprica and the President Gaius Baltar.  Fans of the show before won't be disappointed with plenty of action between the various characters and the Cylons (them having their issues themselves).The Cylons attempt to make peace with the colonists by starting up a police force made up of colonists of New Caprica.  It just insights the rebels as many view the new police as traitors conspiring with the Cylons.More background of the characters are revealed and the tensions are flaring over Baltar's impending trial for crimes against the colonists that will seperate people and thrust them onto opposing sides with varying views on death being the penalty and others wanting the justice system to actually do what it should do.  If anything Season 3 of BG continues to do what a lot of shows can't...be consisent.
"This show is much much better than I had ever hoped. It succeeds brilliantly on all aspects, from storytelling to acting, from direction to production, it is first rate. I had lost interest in the show during season two and had no real desire to watch season three but I saw the dvd and it was an impulse buy. I spent the last day watching the entire season and I was captivated. It is so rare for a science fiction show of this quality to be made anymore. It is truly one of the great seasons ever and, if the Emmys truly meant excellent in tv, the show would receive nominations all over the place.I should point out one person in particular, though I do not even know his name. The actor who plays Gaius Baltar is truly exceptional. It is worth watching just for his performance alone, but that is not to diminish all the other fine actors. There is not a weak performer in the whole season.An AMAZING season."
"What can I really objectively say, I am a total BSG junky and this was a great season.  The writers and actors really put a human face on a concept of a maybe not so distant future and then make the characters human in every sense.  Fos BSG junkies this is a season of healing after a traumatic start to the season and it's one of those seasons where you have to see it from beginning to end to really see this season unfold."
was new & all episodes played with out flaw. fast shipping. great series makes you want to see the next episode. great for science fiction fan.
"Spoiler related wording (basically going around the spoilers, relating to them but not specifically stating what they are):This episode was amazing. The two part judging of Gaius Baltar was really good to. The revealing of 4 more Cylons out of the final five was amazing; especially when you find out who they are. It blew my mind to find out. Anyway, this episode, and the last one, have an intriguing element, the music, that is interesting and weird. I don't really understand why music, but it probably has some meaning. The build up in this series has been really great. This series is now in my top 5. I don't know where to put it. It's awesome. To anyone who hasn't seen this episode or the last one yet, don't skip these, these are very important and amazing episodes. You'll be blown away at the end of this episode, of that I assure you. Really, I do have to wonder who the fifth Cylon is. That's the question that will probably echo through the next season. Great season, awesome series so far, can't wait to watch the next season.Oh, final note, as I didn't list it before. You get to see a someone you didn't expect to see in this episode. Plus, that person has news, great news. It's interesting to see that person again. It really adds to the excitement of the ending of this season. I had to wonder if Lee was hallucinating or not at the end. However, I'm going to guess no, even though that is a really mind-boggling idea. The music at the end was a really big help as it really did add to what was going on; a perfect element to add.This series is awesome. I'm going to love seeing what happens next."
"Battlestar Galactica was (and still is) the best of its genre ever aired.  All 4 seasons were fantastic, but season 3 was superior (outside of the series finale). Even if you're not a sci fi fan, if you haven't seen it you're missing out..."
This is one of the best written scifi series ever. It is worth watching every episode.  It will be enjoyed by any person who enjoys Star Trek type shows.
"What's going to happen next .. In this season after (spoiler) finding a planet which they can live on things happen that they have to leave it and keep on the search for earth.. There are many problems on season 3 that has you thinking of human life, based on the show and what flips are next to be shown on season 4.. Overall a great season .. So far this show has me hooked.."
"Already perched on the mountaintop of cinematic stories in the first two seasons, the third actually raises the level of excellence to new heights. Much of the characterization  the initial seasons developed so well actually becomes still more integral in this, the third season. I became more invested in the safety and sanity of what I have now begun to view as colleagues - their varying motivations, whether well-considered or foolish, with pride, joy, fear, or disapproval. WIth so many human issues being addressed and so many characters involved in simply dealing with the hardships of their trying life, I'm now feeling, as I watch, that I'm living it with them. At this point I find myself wishing the series will never end!"
"One of my favorite television series of all time along with 'The Wire'and 'Breaking Bad'.Like 'The Wire' this is a complex, Dickensian study of human nature,not afraid of asking big questions, and meticulously plotted like agreat novel, so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.Just as 'The Wire' used the overly familiar clich&eacute;' world of the copshow to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions, and 'BattlestarGalactica' uses the sci-fi series, and the idea of human versus robotwars the same way.This is thinking person's sci fi, in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke,or Isaac Asimov. It's about why we are how we are, what it means to bea human being, morality under constant pressure in times of war,fathers and sons, impossible loves, metaphors for modern and recentpolitics and real world situations.My wife, far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes, and we torethrough 5 years of shows in just a few days. It's that addicting.The acting is all at least quite good, and some cast members areremarkable, creating characters full of depth, complexity andcontradiction. The writing is terrific, allowing the characters tochange and grow, but always in ways that make sense, creating seeminglyinexplicable conundrums, only to find surprising, sometimes shocking -but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they'vetaken us. The special effects are generally very impressive for TV,even if they're not really why you watch this show.It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I've everseen, and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out andblown away. I was sad to get to the last episode, just as one is sad tofinish a great book.The third season represented a bit of a transition to something atouch more surreal, a little odder, which would pay off fullyin the last two seasons.  There are moments where the show seemsto have lost it's way a bit, but it comes back quickly, and somethings that have a 'what was that about?' feeling in season 3will be very important in what's yet to come.  Trust the show."
"This show is a lot of fun to watch, and who knows, maybe you'll get to see Kara Thrace become Ms. Marvel in an upcoming Avengers movie ;)The struggles between a father and son, humans marrying &#34;toasters&#34;, and the race for be the first to find the long lost Planet Earth.  This show has great depth, and is a lot of fun to watch :)"
"I continue to be amazed at how much I love ""Battlestar Galactica."" I usually don't enjoy science fiction, but this show is unlike any other sci-fi series I've seen before. In fact, ""BSG"" just may be my favorite television show of all time, which says a lot!Season Three of ""BSG"" picks up right where Season Two left off. The majority of people have been living on New Caprica for more than a year and are trying to build new lives for themselves. Unfortunately, the cylons eventually managed to track the humans down. After invading New Caprica, the cylons convinced President Gaius Baltar to cooperate with them. Now people live in constant fear of the cylon occupation. Resistance leaders including Chief Tyrol and Colonel Tigh continue to fight the cylons and attempt to come up with an escape plan, which is a very hard thing to do since both Adamas and their respective ships jumped away from New Caprica as soon as the cylons invaded. Obviously, the Adamas and their small crew can't just abandon the rest of humanity, and an elaborate rescue attempt is planned.I don't want to reveal too many details about the season and spoil things for people who may not have seen it yet. However, there's a lot that goes on in Season Three, especially where Tyrol, Tigh, Tory, Anders, and Starbuck are concerned. If you thought the Season Two finale was shocking, just wait until you see what happens at the end of Season Three!There are a few small issues I have with this season. First of all, I think there are too many ""one-shot episodes"" that don't really seem to advance the main plot of the show at all. Having a few episodes like that is fine, but I think there were an abundance of them this time around. Also, I'm not sure how I feel about the way certain music served as a major revelation during the season finale. Hopefully Season Four will do a good job of explaining things.Overall, though, this was a great season. I'm very sad that there's only one more season left, but I can't wait for it to start up again in March."
"Another great season.  Good stories, incredible acting, does Edward James Olmos ever do a bad take? The entire run of this series seems to parallel current US politics and keeping with this theme, the President is starting to frack me off. What is her problem?  She is showing the same symptoms of fundamentalist elitism as ""W"".  I'm expecting her to walk on the bridge of Galactica and announce that she's the ""decider"".Basic Jr. College Anthropology has shown that when 2 cultures come together the first thing that happens is a lot of hatred and fighting (the humans vs. cylons).  Next comes a blending where they begin to need each other and lastly is a merger where they share a manifest destiny and work together towards this goal.The series seems to be moving in this direction but I'm sure the writers will pull the rug out from under us momentarily.  Gosh, I love this series."
"Even I have to admit that season 3 drags on some, but it is very insiteful as you learn quit a bit about the Cylons.  And the season finally will leaving you with your heart stopped and your jaw completely on the floor."
"I have to say, this season was one of my favorites, not knowing if Starbuck would comeback, Adama's will to continue on the search for earth,  Boltar's relationship with the Cylons, The Cylon Athena....where do I start."
"I love the stories. I especially love that all the characters are shown to have both good and bad points, just as real people do."
Very good serial video and has excellent visual and audio.  The continuing story is fascinating and the plots are reasonable and the acting is great.  Hard to downgrade any production of this quality.
"Warning! The following contains spoilers. If you haven't seen Season Three and want to remain spoiler free, do not read this review.Season Three of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA was the most debated and controversial yet. Much of the controversy stemmed from the number of hot button political topics it addressed. What other show would take several major characters we know and love and have them execute another character we had known from the beginning of the series for collaborating with the enemy, demonstrating in the process the extreme danger to justice inherent in independent military tribunals (disturbingly similar to the ones that the Bush administration has advocated)? What other show takes up the logic and ethics of suicide bombing by having ""us"" attack ""them"" by the death of another semi-recurring character in an effort to kill recruits for the local police force? Many of the episodes outraged those on the political right, as the parallels with the situation in Iraq was, despite efforts to minimize the resemblance by references by creator Ron Moore in interviews to Vichy France, became increasingly blatant. To his credit Moore, a member of the left but a self-admitted Rush Limbaugh listener, has not had the show lean too heavily to the left for most of the show's run, but in the season's first several episodes that balance fell away. And in the most controversial episode of the season (debated on Internet boards more passionately than I can ever remember any episode of any show) the question of whether genocide against a murderous enemy is justified, pitting several of the major characters on the show against each other.On the other hand, Season Three had several surprisingly uninspired episodes. All of these were of the ""stand alone"" variety. All of the ""mythology"" episodes (to use the X-FILES terminology that Ron Moore himself often uses) were outstanding. In posts on boards, podcasts, and interviews Moore has said that most of these episodes are produced by the insistence of the network. The thinking is that having nothing but arc episodes intimidates potential viewers. But the brute fact is that at this point in the series it is a sheer impossibility for anyone to start watching at this point. This is the beauty of DVDs. Anyone who wants to watch BATTLESTAR GALACTICA can by buying the DVDs, borrowing them from a friend, downloading them from iTunes, or renting them from Netflix or their local DVD rental store. Bizarrely the networks don't seem to have comprehended the ways that viewing patterns have changed.Season Three is structured around the Cylon occupation of New Caprica and the ongoing effects of that occupation following the rescue of the humans by Galactica. Many of the characters on the show never quite get over their experiences there, in particular Tigh and Kara. Interpersonal conflicts that were created on New Caprica, especially between Kara and Lee, take much of the season resolve, and the whole New Caprica experience doesn't really come to an end until the close of the trial of Baltar in the season finale. In one way or another the experiences there color almost everything that happens during the season.Instead of summing up individual episodes or talking about the major story arcs, I would like to highlight my ten favorite moments of the entire season.1. The Adama Maneuver: During the rescue on New Caprica Adama gets crucial Vipers into the fray by jumping into the upper atmosphere of the planet. Since Galactica cannot fly in an atmosphere, they launch the Vipers as the ship plunges in a fiery ball towards the surface, jumping again just a couple of hundred feet before smashing into the earth. It is - and I say this with little fear of contradiction - the most extraordinary special effect in the history of TV. No one who has seen it has been able to forget it. It is inconceivable that the show won't win the Emmy this year for Best Special Effects (but then, it is impossible to see how they lost to LOST and its black smoke effect last year) and when it does, this is the special effect sequence they will show at the awards.2. Leoben has imprisoned Kara in a living situation that parodies that of a married couple. As they dine Leoben stands beside her and tells her how beautiful she looks. She smiles and rams a pair of skewers through his neck, kicks him back and falls on his chest stabbing him repeatedly. She returns to the dining table, takes a bite, then daintily dabs at her mouth with a napkin, oblivious to the blood that covers one of her hands.3. The death of Jammer: In ""Collaborators"" several characters we've known and loved kill Jammer for being a collaborator during the Cylon occupation of New Caprica. We've known Jammer since Season One when he, Cally, and Socino tried to make a still. But that doesn't prevent him from being shot out an airlock. Nearly as good was the near execution of Gaeta later in the same episode.4. Five great Sharon moments. This is a total cheat, but here are five great moments involving Sharon in Season Five. 1) The last time we saw Sharon in Season Two she was deeply distrusted from not having told Galactica about Cavil being a Cylon. She had told Helo that she wanted nothing to do with him or anyone on Galactica. Our first shot of her in Season Three, her cell door is open and we see it filled with comfortable furniture: a desk with books, an end table and coffee table, wall hangings and curtains, a comfy chair, and a large and extremely comfortable leather couch. Adama is sitting beside her drinking tea and he tells her that he feels all alone, except for her. Clearly in the previous year, somehow Sharon had become just about Adama's closest friend. 2) Because of the new trust Adama has in Sharon, she becomes an officer in the colonial fleet. Through the rest of the season she repeatedly tells others - whether human or Cylon - that she has given the fleet her word and she intends to keep it. Though some doubt her, Adama's faith in her is repaid repeatedly in the season. 3) Sharon enters the Cylon Detention Center on New Caprica to recover the launch keys that are crucial if the humans are to escape from New Caprica. She gets interrupted by D'Anna Biers, who tries to tempt her into coming back to the Cylons with the news that Hera is still alive. Sharon responds by putting a bullet into both her D'Anna's knees. She walks away, saying ""Adama wouldn't lie to me"" (and it turns out he didn't, since he didn't know that Laura stole Hera and faked her death). 4) Sharon and Boomer come face to face. One of the season highlights had to be the show's two major Number Eight's meeting. The irony is intense, since at the beginning of the series Sharon was completely on the side of the Cylons and Boomer was with the fleet, unaware that she was a Cylon sleeper agent. Now, however, Boomer like D'Anna before her tries to convince Sharon that she doesn't belong with the humans. Her reply is to the point: ""I made my decision and I know where my loyalties lie."" 5) Boomer does, however, tell Sharon that her daughter is still alive and is on the nearby Cylon basestar. After Adama confirms with Roslin that Boomer's story is true, Sharon rescues Hera by talking her husband Helo into killing her so that she will resurrect on the Cylon resurrection ship. Only seconds after reaching Hera she plots her return to Galactica. The irony is that only a few minutes earlier Roslin was dressing down both Helo and Adama for their faith in Sharon. Knowing that Sharon is downloading into a new body she tells them, ""And now all of our lives are in the hands of Sharon Agathon. All we can do is hope that your wife is worthy of the unconditional trust you place in her, Captain. And you as well, Admiral."" What is wonderful is that Laura states all this as if it is in doubt. But less than an hour later Sharon is back on Galatica with Hera. Oh, and Sharon is given her own handle: Athena, a nod to the original series in which Athena was Adama's daughter. And in this one Sharon has become one of his surrogate daughters.5. ""Exodus, Pt. 2"": I said I wouldn't summarize any episodes and I will resist doing that here. But this episode, which contained ""The Adama Maneuver"" I mentioned above, is easily one of the two or three most unforgettable episodes in all of BSG. At the end of 2006 the well-known Internet TV website The Futon Critic issued its annual list of the Top Fifty episodes of the year. With total justification they named ""Exodus, Pt. 2"" the number one episode of 2006, not just of BSG but of all television shows combined. It was that good. Four beats made it stand out. First, Saul Tigh's killing of his wife Ellen for collaborating with the Cylons, second the Adam Maneuver, third, the rescue of Galactica by Pegasus and its destruction, and fourth, Kara learning that Leoben had lied to her by telling her that Kacey was her daughter.6. The fight between Kara and Lee in ""Unfinished Business."" In the Season Two finale we learned that somehow Lee and Kara had fallen out with each other so completely that they were barely able to talk to one another. In this episode we get that back story. Adama has called for a series of boxing matches to air out grievances that crew members feel towards one another. We see Lee and Kara's story intercut with their pounding on each other in the boxing ring, learning of the night of passion that they spent with each other and their declaring their love for one another, and of Kara's sneaking off and marrying Anders the next morning. As Kara and Lee (who she is able to fight evenly partly because Helo beat up on him in an earlier fight and partly because Kara resorts to dirty fighting) collapse into each other's arms, their faces bloody messes, she tells him, ""I missed you."" His mouth filled with blood, he is barely able to say, ""I missed you too."" Her face buried in his shoulder, you can see her smile broadly as the episode ends. One of the best episodes in the show's run.7. In a stunning scene on a Cylon basestar, D'Anna Biers tortures Baltar while he manages to project to a beach where Six makes love to him to get him through the ordeal. As he tells Six ""I love you"" D'Anna hears the words as addressed to her and although torturing him feels deeply moved. It is a sequence that has to be seen to be believed.8. Adama and Laura's intimacy. Through Season Three Adama and Laura grow closer and closer, as intimate as two people can be while remaining completely Platonic. They still have conflicts. When Laura tries to justify stealing Hera and faking her death Adama walks away without even listening to her. And in the finale Roslin feels betrayed by his vote of Not Guilty in Baltar's trial. But you get the sense that they have moved to a new level. That they have an intimacy that can't be affected by mere disagreement. The highpoint of their intimacy might be their smoking dope on New Caprica and cuddling while gazing up at the stars. It is so wonderful to see two people who have shouldered so much in order to save the remnants of humanity to get a few minutes of peace/9. Lee Adama's moment on the stand. During Baltar's trial Romo Lampkin (magnificently portrayed by Mark Shepard) calls Lee onto the witness stand even though he is serving as co-counsel. Jamie Bamber's performance is one of the season highlights and perhaps the best moment in a season finale stuffed to overflowing with truly great moments.10. The last ten minutes of the season: In the final few minutes of the season we learn the identify of four of the Final Five: Tigh, Tyrol, Samuel T. Anders, and Tory (the four T's--giving additional credence to the thought of some that Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace is the fifth member) by their response to a song that they keep hearing in their heads, which turns out, almost impossibly, to be Bob Dylan's ""All Along the Watchtower"" (leading some to refer to them as the Dylons). Then the Cylons attack. The four new Cylons ponder what to do before Tigh magnificently tells the other three: ""The ship is under attack, we do our jobs. . . . My name is Saul Tigh. I am an officer in the Colonial Fleet. Whatever else I am, whatever else it means, that's the man I want to be. And if I die today, that's the man I'll be. But those lines are rivaled by the last of the season, as Lee pursues ""a bogie at my ten"" in his Viper and discovers none other than Kara Thrace, who had died spectacularly three episodes earlier. She looks at Lee, assures him that it really is her (a fact confirmed by executive producer Ron Moore, who also confirmed that the four Cylons really are Cylons), and tells him, ""It's gonna be okay. I've been to Earth. I know where it is. And I'm gonna take us there."" The camera pulls up over their two Vipers and then rapidly pulls back through the colonial fleet, through the pursing Cylons, back through the nebula and an arm of the Milky Way, and then rushes across the galaxy to our solar system, focusing on earth as the season ends. It is an utterly breathtaking moment.This is absolutely essential television. If you care for great television, this is the kind of stuff you have to care about. The tragedy is that while every major television critics has passionately praised the show and while a host of major publications from TV Guide to Time to Rolling Stone have proclaimed it the best show on TV, it has struggled to find viewers. The irony is that many Sci-fi fans don't watch it because it doesn't resort to the clich&eacute;s that dominate the genre and make it in most cases completely unchallenging television and many mainstream TV fans don't watch it because they mistakenly think it will only appeal to Sci-fi fans. It is what it is: the best show on TV. You need to watch this."
"I was never a fan of the earlier Battlestar Galactica of the seventies. I preferred to watch Star Trek. However, I am hooked on this remake. The acting is great and the plot captivating. The characters are believable, and the cinematography quite spectacular. There are many twists in the story: you will be eagerly awaiting the next episode. My favorite character: Kate `Starbuck'!Though I did not like Battlestar Galactica Razor, and actually started Season 3 with low expectations because of it, I ended up loving Season 3.Season 2 ended with the Cylons discovering and invading New Caprica. Gaius Baltar, the President of the twelve colonies, surrenders to them, while Galactica and the rest of the fleet escape.Season 3 opens with the stranded Colonials struggling to survive under the Cylon rule. A terrorist group is formed to fight the Cylons, and sacrifices are made. We see humans strapping themselves with bombs, and blowing themselves up in the presence of Cylons and their human sympathizers.Can we stop for a second here? Isn't this what the Palestinians are doing in Israel, and the Iraqis in Iraq? What are the producers of this show trying to tell us? Is it that whenever a nation takes over another all means at one's disposal should be used to attack the invader, including using humans as bombs? Furthermore, terrorism is shown to be in the eye of the beholder. To the colonials, the terrorists are freedom fighters. To the Cylons, they are simply terrorists. There are some provocative scenes, but after all, this is the kind of world we live in.We are shown Admiral Adama struggling with his crew to save the colonials, and to resume his quest to find Earth. The following is a spoiler so stop reading now if you haven't watched the show yet: Adama does come back to New Caprica and rescues the Colonials. The Season continues with trying to find Earth. New clues are discovered, and a planet is found where early Earth settlers lived.Season 3 focuses on the human element, survival, and punishment. Even after the Colonials are rescued by Adama, some crew members take the role of vigilante, ejecting betrayers into space out of an airlock. These `victims' are not judged by a jury of their peers, nor are they given legal representation.  Again we are shown how people broken by war resort to unconventional and immoral actions that are fully justifiable by them alone. Again, depends through which eyes you are looking. Adama did not see such actions justifiable, and he put a stop to them. However, the perpetrators, or self-appointed jury, were never charged.I very much liked the episode where a chance is given to Adama to exterminate the Cylons. There is talk of genocide, and many in the fleet are against exterminating the Cylons. But wait a second. Cylons are machines. If today we decided to destroy all Windows based PCs in the world in favor for Apple, would this be genocide? What if some of the Windows PC contained human DNA, would destroying them then qualify as genocide? Meanwhile, though, the Cylons decide against exterminating the human race, resorting to living in harmony with them. Again, the writers manage to include provocative topics in this series. Isn't this what good TV is all about?Another episode I liked was the trial of Gaius Baltar, bringing to mind scenes from John Grisham. Again, whether Baltar is a traitor or not depends on the eye of the beholder. We know he was forced to take certain actions by the Cylons, but we also know that he had his own motivations in certain actions as well. His trial brings up many provocative and controversial topics. I personally thought that episode was the best one. I like it when TV episodes make me think days on end.The Season ends with a huge revelation: some of the Galactica crew are actually Cylons. I won't tell you who, because I know some of you who haven't seen the show will read this review, and this revelation could spoil the whole season! Just let's say you will be utterly surprised. However, I think the writers took a big risk with such a revelation. We'll have to wait for Season 4 to see what all of this means. Will the Cylons and human beings end up living in harmony?Starbuck is also resurrected in the last episode. We saw her die three episodes earlier. She says to Lee,""It's gonna be okay. I've been to Earth. I know where it is, and I'm going to take us there."" Is she a Cylon too? Did Lee see another Starbuck copy?I really enjoyed the bonus disk, ""The Story so far."" This episode recaps all that happened from the beginning of Season 1 to this Season. There were many scenes I had forgotten, and this episode sort of brought everything together again.There is only one issue I have with this show: I think there are too many standalone episodes that don't really seem to advance the main plot of the show. The major appeal of this show (at least to me) is its continuity: how each episode continues on the previous one. Seeing too many standalone episodes kind of destroys the flow of the storyline, and slows down the action.Battlestar Galactica is a great show for all sci-fi fans! Like Razor, Season 3 is shot in HD (High Definition)."
"Don't miss this series. Best scifi of its kind, actually fairly unique. Great characters and great story backed by wonderful fx and cinematography"
"You really have to see seasons 1 and 2 to follow along with series, but each episode is interesting on its own. Admiration goes to the actors and series details, as each intertwines the past set of episodes into the newer ones, with added intrigue and drama as the race to Earth continues. Animation and science fiction detail add to the realism, although most of the scenes are more about societal changes and moral issues that make each episode build on the next."
"Have loved this series from the first episode. The characters, the music, the sound effects, and the scenes of the ships in space. Going to hate  for the series to end."
"I didn't think it was possible to match or improve on the previous seasons of this fearless series, but then I watched season 3 on DVD.What's best about this show is that the writers and producers are not afraid to take on the tough issues of our times and reflect them back to us through the characters and storylines on BSG.This time, we follow several characters on story arcs which alter their lives forever.  There's Lee Adama and wife Dee, whom he married mainly to try to get over Kara Thrace.  Kara herself is revealed to be the daughter of a bitter, abusive mother.  Lee's complicated relationship with his father, William, is further strained to the breaking point during Baltar's trial.  In the meantime, Saul Tigh continues to drink himself into a stupor over having killed his beloved but traitorous wife, Ellen, and then discovers a horrifying truth about himself along with several colleagues.  The heretofore likeable Felix Gaeta turns out to have been in league with Baltar, to a degree, and then perjures himself on the witness stand.  And the Cylons themselves show us more faces, more personality, and more of a purpose than they ever have before.  Lastly, Agathon and Athena must deal with the fact that she's a Cylon and their baby daughter is a hybrid.  I hope that more will be done with this in the last season."
"I'm a newcomer to ""Battlestar Galactica"" and am only now watching the series on DVD.  After a somewhat lackluster Season 2.5, BSG got back on track with an action-packed Season 3.  The colonialists have settled on New Caprica, only to be invaded again by the Cylons, although the Cylons have a different intention this time.  The season is full of action and intriguing plotlines, as the colonialists mount a resistance movement to escape from New Caprica, which reverberates throughout the entire season.Season 3 contains some extremely strong plotlines and episodes.  I was particularly impressed with ""Collaborators"" in which the resistance deals with the colonialists who worked with the Cylons in various ways.  The episode is powerful and reflects the kind of long-term implications of war; creator Ronald Moore aptly compared this episode to the kinds of things seen in France after WWII, for example.  I'm always a sucker for the darker, more politically-tinged episodes of BSG, and this one really did it for me.The season contains several stand-alone episodes that don't continue the main plotline of the search for Earth.  Some of these episodes work well, especially ""Dirty Hands,"" which considers the blue-collar workers who are toiling in the fleet under nearly impossible conditions.  Unfortunately, some of the stand-alones are less successful, particularly ""Hero"" and ""A Day in the Life.""  Overall, I was pleased with the directions in which they take the main characters, although I was disappointed that Duwalla's part continues to shrink and be less satisfying.  I also was not fond of the turn taken by Starbuck as she follows her ""destiny.""  I've never been a Starbuck fan, and I found this entire plotline irritating.  Hearing Ronald Moore give Katee Sackhoff constant tongue-baths on the dvd podcast commentaries just added to my irritation.  The woman does all her acting by curling her lips, clearing her throat, and making weird snorting giggles.  Please make her stop!  Ok, I feel better now.Fortunately, the season ends with some very exciting episodes.  Foremost among them is the reveal of four of the final five Cylons.  As is typical of BSG, the season ends with some great cliffhangers that promise to take the series in intriguing new directions.  What I perhaps love most about BSG is its willingness to make changes rather than resting on its laurels.  The story is constantly driving forward and taking us to new places, which is sometimes uncomfortable but always thrilling.  For me, Season Three was better than Season 2.5 and about in par with Seasons 2.0 and 1."
"For two seasons, I watched Battlestar Galactica expecting a type of greatness that just never seemed to be realized.  It had its epic moments, of course, but I always felt as the drama was held back just when it should have been accelerated.  In this third season, however, the drama, character development, and overall plotlines are some of the most extraordinary hours ever produced for television.Because I am loathe to give out any spoilers, I won't discuss the contents of the episodes in this review.  Suffice it to say, however, that viewers get a ""little bit of everything"" in this third go-'round, including...-An insider's point of view on the Cylons.-Some incredible emotional drama stemming from the New Caprica situation.-Not a single episode that is a ""dud""-A finale that is so epic and surprising that it takes a while to fully even sink in.I started watching BSG because I was looking for another ""LOST"" (what I consider to be the greatest TV show of all-time).  Though I don't think (as a whole) BSG lives up to that lofty mantra, I will say that it's third season is as compelling of drama as anything LOST ever produced.Thus, I do not understand the many people who consider this to be the ""weakest"" season of the show, as for me it was the season where everything finally came together in the big-time payoff.  I can't wait to see what the final season has in store for these characters I now have so much emotional attachment to!"
"After watching the first three seasons of 'Rescue Me' this season may disappoint some fans, it's still an excellent TV show, but they seemed to steer away from the firehouse banter that we've all become addicted to. The show is laced with wit, action and drama of the best kind. The cast is colorful with layers of deep emotion. After a long break I eagerly await season five! The show is filmed in widescreen and it looks great on a big screen. This season includes commentary and some interesting extras."
"Haven't received it yet......Planning on taking it with me on Vacation, won't return till Feb 15th"
The superb acting by Glen Close makes this a great series!  Never get enough of watching the multiple plots and surprises.
this is a great series that I wish could go on and on. I watched end of previous season for a refresher before new one started to keep up with all the twists and turns.
"What an incredble series!  Very well written.  Never knew what would happen next.  Extremely intense and you will be ""hooked"" after the 1st episode.  Anxiously awaiting season 2!!"
The two things that make for engaging TV watching.  The plot is razor sharp and the players are as good as it gets.  One of the best dramas in recent years.
"This griping premiere season has a good story, actors/actresses to carry the main plot (principle case) to its suspenseful conclusion, and film direction that continue to compel my interest in every season. Glen Close is a ruthless and stalwart prosecuting attorney that is &#34;everyman's&#34; advocate. Her co-star, Rose Byrnes, does a splendid job of being her &#34;assistant&#34;. However, good people are hurt in the &#34;process&#34;; the ends just may justify her methods."
"Once you figure out the central gimmick in this FX series, you'll untie the complexities of its plotting and character development. It's really simple. No one is actually who they appear to be, right down to the minor players and even those who appear less than briefly. It's brilliant, really. They have hidden agendas, hidden relationships and hidden skeletons. The other gimmick is the constant time shifting: scenes play out ""Three Months Later"" etc etc constantly throughout, but you only get a tease of what's really going on. The writing here is top-notch, and old Glenn Close really outdoes herself as the Machiavellian lawyer who bends every ethics rule that ever existed on her way to trying to win damages cases. Unrealistic? Well, yes. This is a TV show. Ted Danson is great as a corporate villain, by the way, as are other name actors in later seasons. If you like court dramas, this one is miles above most."
"Clearly a great program, just a little odd, and it jumps around from past to present, then present to past. Glenn Close is an absolute evil(you figure out the rest), and scary in this series. There are so many unexpected twist and turns that I spent the weekend watching season 2, don't leave the room put the streaming on hold. Fatal Attraction was just a prelude to this actress' ablilty to play a role."
"Loved Season one, a must see. Once you get through season 1 you'll want to continue watching just to find out what's Patty Hewes' next move."
"to your sleeping time.  The show is very addictive and intriguing as it keeps you into it throughout every episode.  Of course we have Glenn Close playing as a top notch, take no prisoners and ruthless attorney defending people that were swindled out of their pensions and savings from the corrupt boss played by Ted Danson.  Who also does a wonderful job is his role.  As does the new attorney played by Rose Byrne who starts out as a wide eyed, the world is wonderful person.  But by season end so many things will happen to her that will change not only her views.  But her very way of life as well.An excellent show and an well written and directed first season.  There are so many other characters in the show that do their thing acting as well.  Well worth your buying but rent a couple episodes first to make sure this show is your cup of tea.  Really looking forward to the next season of Damages without a doubt."
"This show is full of villains and good guys and always keeps you guessing. Each night, we look forward to watching what next twist will be thrown at us!"
"This series was phenomenal!!!!! Glenn Close was awesome!  I ended up watching all the seasons, and was so disappointed that the show ended!"
Boy was this a great series.  I sincerely hated that it ended.  Glenn Close is fantastic as well as the rest of the cast.
Crazy scarey characters the plot twists and turns .Evil series with thiroughly despicable people but addictive and I can't stop watching it  but sort of like a mosquito bite you just can't stop scraping
I was told by a friend that this was a good series and it is. I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a good &#34;Who Done It?&#34;  So many twist and turns that you don't see coming.  WARNING:.....it's like a book you can't put down until it's finished.
"..done with style and grace. Wow, this started off as interesting but was full-blown riveting by mid-season. The characters develop with the story and it's amazing how well-acted and nicely written the first season is.  Ellen (Rose Byrne) started off ok for me but became fascinating as the story thickened.  As tension boils over her character seems only to grow more and more subdued in expression, if not with a touch of melancholy, yet with power underlying an understated performance.  G. Close is excellent, as usual, having mastered the art of Queen b*tch, and Danson puts in a fantastic performance - wow, it's been so long since I've seen him in action. His character is simultaneously sympathetic and corrupt - a likable bad guy, though for all his corruption he still doesn't generate the contempt that Patty Hughes does (Close).  He hasn't shined like this since Cheers, and it's great to see him step back into such a convincing and full-bodied role even this late in his career.  Danson's charm still works to great effect here.  His lawyer Ray Fiske, is multi-faceted and excellent, as are nearly all the other supporting actors in the series.  What's not to like?!  Didn't I catch somewhere that Soprano writers or producers were at work here?  Wouldn't be surprising.  This first season is of similar caliber."
"This show does for the courtroom TV genre what ""The Shield"" did for cop shows.  That is, it knocks you off balance, jumbles things around in a soup of moral ambiguity, and just really pumps new life into a tired genre.  You won't be sure who (or if there is one) the protagonist is throughout the whole season.  Glenn Close is her usual intimidating self, Zeljko Ivanek plays a star litigator, Tate Donovan his counterpart, and of course TED DANSON is amazing as the alternately shocking and hilarious Arthur Frobisher.  At 19.99, this is a steal, consdering people used to line up to pay 100 bucks for 12 episodes of shows like the Sopranos..."
"&#34;Damages&#34; is what riveting television is all about.  The characters are rich and deep, their motivations mutli-faceted, their loyalties complex, ever-changing, or just non-existent.  Glenn Close is brilliant as Patty Hewes, portraying nuanced emotions with a deftness rarely seen on television.Season 1 focuses on a lawsuit against a &#34;pump and dump&#34; business owner named Arthur Frobisher (played surprisingly well by Ted Danson) who convinced his employees to empty their pensions and retirement plans into the company's stock before selling every last share he owned.  Acquitted in a criminal hearing, it's up to Patty Hewes and her firm (including the incomparable Rose Byrne as new associate Ellen Parsons) to make things right with the employees who've been left with nothing.It sounds very court-centric on the surface, but it isn't.  There's mystery, double-crosses, schemes, DIRTY LAWYERING!, and even murder.  The story is told creatively.  We see flashes of the present, but the majority of the narrative takes place in the past.  We see the case unfold and the events that led up to the harrowing opening scene.  As the present plays out slowly over the season, the past eventually catches up. When the two meet, it's sheer brilliance.  All those threads finally connect and weave a tapestry of pure entertainment."
You will not regret buying this series.  Glen Close is outstanding.  All of the performances are amazing.  You won't be able to stop watching.  Many twists and turns.  The entire writing staff should get an Emmy.  I hope they get the other seasons in blu ray fast!  Can't wait.
"Viewer be warned, for a legal drama there is really not much in the way of courtroom scenes. It has more to do with the legal process (deposition, finding witnesses, filing motions, etc.).I've been watching this on Netflix instant and was hooked from the first episode. It starts out as a CSI ""Who Dunnit"" approach, showing someone who was murdered followed by a random woman roaming the streets covered in blood. Each episode reveals a piece of the puzzle, until everything makes sense with the final episode and brings you up to speed. By the time you catch up, the season is over and you're amazed they were able to draw you in for so many episodes. And, you want more!The cast is amazing with some heavy hitters. Ted Danson stars as Mr. Frobisher, a multimillionaire businessman who will stop at nothing to keep his money safe. Glenn Close plays Pattie Hughes, a rough and tumble lawyer who has many, many sides to her. Trying to figure her out is darn near impossible. She adapts to anything thrown at her and seems to be one step ahead at almost all times. The second season features Mario Peebles, Timothy Olyphant, William Hurt, and Marcia Gray Harden. There are others I'm sure, I simply do not recognize them.All in all, great series that keeps you captivated and entertained. Watch an episode and see for yourself!"
"One of the biggest treats of the 2007 television season was ""Damages,"" a wicked and wonderful legal thriller from FX.  Headlined by Glenn Close, I expected to enjoy this show--but I wasn't prepared for the level of sophistication, complexity, and intelligence it offered up from its first twisty, and twisted, moments.  Made for adults, this drama demands attention and may not be for the casual viewer.  With its intricate plotting and structure, the story is told from different time periods interwoven throughout each episode.  Essentially, snippets of the story are presented in each time frame, so the audience is left to speculate about the full truth in any given instance.  However, as the season progresses, the pieces start to connect in unexpected ways that can both surprise and frustrate.  I'd compare the narrative flow of ""Damages"" to that of a fine novel--telling you just enough so that you are tantalized to stick around for the next chapter.The plot of ""Damages"" is a knotty web that is difficult to describe briefly.  Ostensibly, the show revolves around a naive young lawyer played by Rose Byrne.  The opening scenes show a bedraggled and bloodied Byrne stumbling down the streets of New York--apparently the victim (or perhaps the perpetrator) of an act of violence.  Cut to six months earlier and a proper introduction is made.  Byrne is seduced and recruited by a major law firm run by Glenn Close.  Close seems to have a hidden agenda, but Byrne is quickly overcome by the trappings of success and acceptance.  The firm is handling an enormous class action lawsuit against one of the town's most prominent businessmen, played by Ted Danson, and Byrne ends up squarely in the midst of much legal intrigue.  What follows includes lying, blackmail, corruption, and even murder--no one in this story remains an innocent.While I actually think the plot is the real star of ""Damages"" (I don't think I've ever said that about a TV show before)--it certainly doesn't hurt that the cast is uniformly excellent.  Don't be surprised if you see Close front and center come awards time.  Her thinly veiled menace and cutting remarks make for classic villainy, but Close pulls it off in a way that you can't help but love!  Byrne and all the key supporting players are solid and believable.  I particularly liked Zeljko Ivanek and Peter Facinelli, but the real revelation to me was Ted Danson.  Honestly, I've followed Danson since he was a bit player in ""Body Heat"" and I think this is by far his best role.  Mixing equal parts charm and bile, this is a great actor in a beautifully written role.Again, I don't recommend ""Damages"" to everyone--I only wish I could!  If, however, you love sophisticated drama--give this a shot.  The DVD format is the perfect way to watch this show at your own pace and enjoy all its subtleties, surprises, and delights.  But, be reminded, if you sit down to watch this show--WATCH IT!  Otherwise, you might not appreciate how intricately put together ""Damages"" really is.  KGHarris, 12/07."
I can't get enough of this show!  I just finished watching 3 episodes and would be watching a 4th if it weren't almost midnight.  Great acting and suspenseful story.
"I had no idea what I was getting into with this show, and it continues to grab me and yet shock me every episode.  If you had always agreed with the expression &#34;kill all the lawyers&#34; , this show will give you reasons.  It is filled with outstanding acting...Glen Close is breathtaking in her evil.  One thing about it....trust no one.  It is not an easy show to watch but you can't help coming back for more."
Had heard great things about this series and sampled 5 shows last night.  Very addictive series with great suspense.Love the diverse characters and smart dialogue.  Lots of plot twists.  Brilliant acting by Glenn Close and Ted Danson.  What a great find!  Looking forward to more nights of viewing.
The cast is great and perfectly cast. I watched the entire 1st season in a week and the second season the following week.
Great show well done keeps you in suspense throughout.  The quality on the free amazon prime is great don't pay for hd
"Damages is the best of manipulation, murder, and overall mayhem.  If you are into shows that provoke your thoughts with the possibilities of actuality, watch this."
"""Damages"" is that kind of show that has you on the edge of your seat  completely confused as to what is going to happen next and in utter surprise when you discover each piece of the truth. It was one of the best shows of last season without a doubt. The show centered around Ellen (Byrne), who begins to work in the lawfirm of Patty Hewes (Glenn Close) who is a ruthless, self-serving and completely unpredictable lawyer. She focuses her work on a class action lawsuit against Arthur Frobisher (amazingly played by Danson) for insider trading. The first scene of the first episode shows Ellen running half naked in a raicoat covered in blood in the streets of New York. In each episode we discover a new piece of the puzzle and the events that led to that first scene. The past/present technique is masterfully used making each viewer very involved in solving the mystery. The performance of actors is excellent and the show is amazing. Damages is truly a great show."
"The first season of the show Damages with Glenn Close starts out with a cat and mouse game and the stakes just get higher and higher the more shows you watch. Cutthroat isn't even the word with this show... it goes above and beyond. Not only that, during much of my watching, I wasn't sure if I was watching a cat or a mouse at any given time! I came back too, to watch seasons two and three.Great acting and incredibly fast changing story line. Enjoy!"
"This is a really great TV series and I really enjoyed the many twists that kept me guessing throughout the episodes--and guessing wrong most of the time. I've always wanted to be a lawyer, among many other professions, and I immediately picked up this series upon seeing it at the Duty Free shop at Heathrow International Airport.This series exposes the world of litigations, and how they operate.  The whole season is about a class action lawsuit targeting one of the wealthiest CEOs (Chief Executive Officer). When lawyers try to win at all cost, lives and fortunes are lost. Is it worth it all? Are lawyers angels or demons in disguise? How far would we go for money? Is money worth destroying the lives of others? Are secrets worth killing for? Would we kill for money? How much money is enough? What is the price of betrayal, and when is betrayal ethical? These are just a few of the questions you will be asking yourself as you go through this series.The way the series is structured is that it shifts between past events and future ones. I did find this system to be confusing at times, but it does have its merits.This is a fast paced series. The acting is superb and the episodes are very well written and believable. The ending is spectacular, and unanticipated. I can't wait for season two."
Glenn Close and Rose Byrne do a brillant job in this drama series.  It will keep you riveted.  Awesome show!
This is a great series. I already bought season 2 and 3. I have never been a huge Glenn Close fan but after seeing the first season I have completely changed my mind about her acting. Every second of this show kept my attention. A definite must see...
"Everything about the first season of Damages was superb, the writing, the acting, the story line.  It was interesting to see Ellen's character slowly begin to change from the innocent, trusting young lawyer, to the suspicious character portrayed by Glen Close.  The show really is all about trust.  The key line that sums up the entire season is spoken by Close's character Patty Hewes, &#34;Trust no one.&#34;  Not exactly a great message to instill in people, but it works well in a TV drama about lawyers.  Other than Ellen and her boyfriend David there really aren't many characters in this show worth admiring.  Everyone is lying to everyone, which makes it difficult at times to figure out what is really going on, but as the old saying goes, &#34;The truth has a way of rising to the surface,&#34; and all lies are revealed.  All in all, great show.  Highly recommended."
I love how cleverly this show moves. The mindless sex is a serious detraction. I can't enjoy this otherwise wonderful show with my 14 year old. I know people have sex... I don't need to watch their version of fulfillment.
I just finished Season 5 and loved how everything came full circle. This show is not to be missed. Patty and Ellen forever!!!
"There aren't any eccentric characters that make you laugh like Denny Crane on ""Boston Legal"" nor are there any cases neatly tied up at the conclusion of each episode with a bow on them. ""Damages"" follows a single case and the follow out from that case from its beginning until its bitter end. ""Damages"" begins with  Ellen Parsons (Rose Byrne from ""28 Weeks Later"" and ""Sunshine"") bloodied and battered walking the streets of New York until she is discovered by the police. From there the series takes a trip back in time six months earlier a case that Ellen worked on as a new attorney at Patricia Hewes (Glenn Close) & Associates. It's a civil case where Hewes is suing multi-billionaire Arthur Frobisher (Ted Danson) for hollowing out his company and robbing 5000 employees of his company of their pension plans in the process. Having escaped the prosecution of the U.S. Attorney's Office, Frosbisher now must defend himself from claims that he benefited by selling his stocks before his company collapsing and getting away scot-free. Frobisher of course insists that he is innocent and was as much a victim losing the company he cared for as the employees. We see the entire case unfold before our eyes, the double dealings, double crosses and underhanded attempts by both the Hewes and Frobisher's attorney to gain the upper hand in this litigation.""Damages"" is compelling, fascinating and well written featuring a wide variety of characters with their own agendas. No one truly is an angel here although the nave Ellen comes mighty close as she finds herself dragged into Hewes' world and manipulated as much by her boss as she is by the opposition in the case. A personal connection between Ellen and the case is uncovered which also makes Ellen suspect that the only reason she got the job was so that she could be used to gain the upper hand in the case. In the process Ellen sees her ambitions and dreams pull further and further away from her reach just as she thinks she is climbing the corporate ladder of success.  Hewes tells Ellen at one point, ""trust no one"" and the same could be applied to everyone involved in the case.Academy Award nominee/Emmy winner Close, Emmy Award winner Danson, Bryne, Tate Donovan, Peter Riegert, Michael Nouri and a host of film/TV/Broadway veterans bring these characters to life with a vibrancy rare in series television. If the story sounds like it was ripped from the headlines, the Enron, Worldcom and other scandals where corporate CEO's betrayed the public trust and manipulated the market inspired the series but it's the compelling characters and drama that will make you stick around to the conclusion of this 13 episode FX series.The opening had me scratching my head in puzzlement--it looked like crappy low-rez video. It's a faade like everything else here as it is simply a sequence showing us the raw reality that Ellen finds himself trapped in. As the show jumps back six months in time to the beginning of the case, we get a beautifully rendered high definition video image. There are a couple of problems with video noise that occur. It isn't a perfect presentation on Blu-ray but it looks extremely good.Audio sounds marvelous with a TrueHD 5.1 mix that uses the format quite well. It isn't compressed and has terrific dynamic range. The 5.1 format is nicely used given that this is primarily a dialogue driven show with nice ambient effects captured in the surround channels.I was surprised that we only get two audio commentaries on this set as I had hoped for more but both are effective and insightful. Glenn Close, writers/producers Todd Kessler & Glenn Kessler, Daniel Zelman and director Allen Coulter appear on the pilot episode discussing issues they ran into shooting on location in New York during a nasty winter, issues they ran into with trying to bring the series in on budget but without messing with the quality of the show. Close is a bit quiet during the commentary it would be fun to hear her let loose on one by herself or with a moderator. I would have loved to hear Close and her co-stars on a separate audio commentary track discuss the craft of acting, their approach to the material and some of their thoughts during their performances but what we do get is quite good.The second audio commentary features actor Zeljko Ivanek front and center dominating the discussion with the Kesslers and Zelman joining in with technical tidbits from time-to-time. Ivanek has long been one of my favorite character actors and he has largely been underused in many TV shows and movies so its nice to see him get a character as juicy as defense attorney Ray Fiske to sink his teeth into southern drawl and all.""Willful Acts"" is a half hour behind-the-scenes documentary on the making of the series. ""Understanding Class Action"" is designed with an interfact that gives viewers a background on how class action lawsuits work and a definition of the various phrases thrown around in the series. ""Trust No One"" clocks in under fifteen minutes and focuses more on the characters in the series. We also get a variety of deleted scenes. The really cool feature of this set is that the disc is enabled so that the player can remember which episodes you've watched and jump right back to the one you had next in rotation if you choose the ""play all"" feature.""Damages"" is a terrific, compelling legal drama. All 13 episodes of the series plus the extras are on three Blu-ray discs and you also get an insert that gives you the title of each episode, a brief synopsis and credits for each one as well."
Really great first season. Full of twist and unexpected turns. I can't wait to watch season 2! It can only get better!
"Where is Calvin Klein tween's EMMY for her performance.  It is so great that David Carradine's daughter (echo!) gives an even better performance than her dad on Criminal Minds.  I've taped the last scene on my dvr a few times when the episode has reaired because her performance is SO satisfying but rewatching her earlier scenes is important to understand how devastating her character is.  She does crazy things with her face in her scene with VDO who is wearing one of his BEST suits and of course, John Glover is wonderful from his first scene when it is obvious what a burden his daughter's existence is to him but never more so than when he silently rubs his eyes in the interrogation room with the speaker is turned off - in one room, not the other.  There is a HINT of his character's resentment of his former protege that will be given the spotlight in his reappearance in a later season.  FUN."
Vincent D'Onofrio is the best. I miss this show so much. I can watch over and over and never get tired of this show!
"L&O; Criminal Intent is one of my favorite Cop ShowsI'd put it in my top 5 without a Doubt!This season was a tad differentMostly due to NBC's lack of Passion for this Great Cop/Crime Dramascenes look different,  it has this  very different looking Neon Color patternMusic starts every episode  (It very much tries to look and feel like CSI) But, it's still CIThank God I don't understand CSI at all (it's a super Lazy Cop show) yes it's a insane ratings machinesBut, in my defense so is A&E;'s Duck DynastyEven though it tries to borrow tacky gimmicks made famous by CSI  (It still has great writing and acting)This season is without a doubt a re-boot in a wayThe events of Season 5 changed lots of NYPD's Major Case SquadCaptain  DeakinsCaptain  Deakins was forced out due to trying to protect Detective LoganA.D.A.  CarverSeason 5 is so good if you are gona start on this show start with Season 5also Annabella Sciorra as  Detective Carolyn Barek  are all written out  (which is a shame I really liked her)I don't like the fact there was no explanation why Both  Carver & Barek are gone??Eric Bogosian & Julianne Nicholson join the castBoth do add plenty to the show...Big fan of  Eric Bogosian but, he's really not likeable in this season due to the fact his Character is by the book and don't understand or support his two best DetectivesThis season is Detective Mike Logan's season he is in 70% of this seasonThis is Chris Noth's best performance imoGoren & Eames are not featured like usualBut, every episode they are in are  very smart and well writtenThe episode  &#34;Endgame&#34;  with the late Roy Scheider is brilliant and as crazy as it sounds this episode should be a Huge reason why you buy this season it's that strong in every possible waybut, that is not the only great episode this season has some really great onesCriminal Intent IMO is the best Law&Order;if it wasn't for CI there would be no Elementary i'm sure of that9.2/10"
"I just recently discovered this show . I have seen several past episodes on daytime TV. So, I decided to start acquiring seasons when I came across them at a reasonable price - new or used. I found this Sixth Season at a great NEW price. So a good addition to my DVD TV Library.  I've found a few others 'on sale'. This way I can see the early episodes/seasons and  how the characters have grown through the years. Cool"
I have not been able to view this packet yet but it appears to be new as ordered.thank you very much
Criminal Intent is by far the best of all the Law and Order shows on TV ....Season 6 is no exception. Especially the Goran episodes are really good.I can`t wait for them to release season 7
"I am a big Law & Order Fan, loved the connection of Bobby * Emmes , and the other role players that followed. Jeff Goldblum , a few Captain changes but the strong writing and Dick Wolf who is still going strong with a new series based on real DA's . I was sad to see the CI series end , SVU still in production with major role changes and lets not forget the original 20 seasons of Law & Order which is my next purchase. Great to have in your library. You can watch them over and over a catch something you missed. Well Done great that Amazon has them available."
"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit - The Eighth Year is another entertaining season of my fave show. Some of the standout episodes include: Choreographed, Burned, Haystack, Florida, and Annihilated. Christoper Meloni and Mariska Hargitay are talented actors and so is Ice-T. I highly recommend this top-notch show, enjoy!"
Great season as always. Actors are great. Story line is great. What more can be said?
I like this tv show because there is a great story line in each episode. They find and catch the perp and prosecute them. I have all the seasons.
"Law & Order: SVU is definitely one of my favorite shows on TV.  I only discovered it about a year and a half ago and have since become completely addicted.  I purchased the first seven seasons and noticed that the eighth season was not on DVD yet.  That didn't make much sense to me because this season aired in 2006-2007.At any rate, I'm so happy that they are releasing season eight now!  I only hope that season nine follows soon after.  And after this season is finished, I hope they don't wait too long to put it on DVD as well.If you like Law & Order, chances are you'll like this show too."
"I now own 9 seasons of this video, I have always loved the Law & Order series, all of them  and hope to own them all."
"""Law & Order"" stars Mariska Hargitay and Christopher Meloni in 22 Season 8 episodes heavy on drama.  The scripts deal with sex crimes, their perpetrators and victims with often frank language and disturbing, emotionally provocative scenarios.  Guest stars in the eighth season include Marcia Gay Harden, Tim Daly, Blair Underwood, Bernadette Peters, Kim Delaney, and Kal Penn."
This show is incredible.  Finally a well-written storyline that hooks you immediately!!  Damian Lewis does a phenominal job. I liked him instantly and have consistently watched as his character grows. Life has excellent script writing.  I really enjoy this show and hope it continues.  Life requires viewers to actually have a brain as it stimulates deep thought!!  WONDERFUL!  Keep it coming!!!!
"Life is my favorite show of the season.It is well acted, well written, with a fascinating and original premise.The show is full of philosophy, i.e. mans search for meaning and justice.Add to that a couple of beautiful actresses thrown into the mix, and ""Life"" is a thinking man's perfect show!03/01/08I just rewatched all the pre stike episodes this week...And again, I think this is the best drama of the year and one of the best ever on TV. If you haven't seen this show yet, do yourself a favor and start at the beggining and get addicted like me."
"interesting from the start. i am not typcially a fan of any sort of cop show, but this one was so good i cannot wait for the next episode. bought the season pass before it was even half over.the writing here is particularly good for network tv. this show could easily have been on hbo. i just hope nbc doesnt drop the ball on this one. judging from the rest of the slate available so far, this is the only one that isnt insulting and stupid. indeed its grand, nuanced and wonderful. and as i said, very very smert."
"Despite the Monk-like, strange habits exhibited by the Cop-turned-Prisoner-turned-Detective, Charlie, the story provided an excellent synopsis for a cop trying to recapture what he had and then some, while secretly solving his past.  I'll give a few more episodes before making any solid commentments, but LIFE is so far, so good."
"Great Show!  Nerds and Spooks.  It's the perfect partnership.  Chuck, a Stanford drop out, working at the Buy More, gets an  email from his sort of best friend.  The email contains current and past U.S. intelligence.  The email imprints all this data into Chuck's memory.  Soon after, Chuck meets Sara and falls head over heals for her.  It turns out, she is his handler, and charged with keeping him safe, and the information intact.  This is the story of how Chuck grows out of being just a Nerd Herder, to a real spy with the help of friends, family, the CIA, and Sara.  It's a story of nerds, love, action, and comedy.  We love it."
"What do you get when you combine a bumbling geek with hard hitting spies? A truly entertaining comedy/action/adventure, sure to satisfy most geeks and non-geeks alike. Will the geek get the girl? Find out..."
"Based on the promos, this show didn't appeal to me at all.  But I downloaded the free pilot figuring I could always just delete it if it wasn't my cup of tea.  But I found that I liked the main character and although the premise is unlikely, so are most TV shows, if you think about it.Its really more of a drama that has humor, rather than a comedy with drama (if that makes any sense).I will watch this one."
"""Chuck"" was one of the outstanding new shows of the 2007-2008 TV season.  It is a nicely balanced combination of action, spy spoof, and romantic comedy, featuring an outstanding cast and some sharp writing.  ""Chuck: The Complete First Season"" contains all thirteen episodes from a strike-shortened season, and some nice extra features.The premise: Chuck Bartkowski (Zachary Levi) is a twenty-something computer geek working for the BuyMore, a big-box electronics store in L.A.  He shares an apartment with his loving older sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) and her hunky doctor boyfriend.  His life has been stuck in neutral since being kicked out of Stanford, framed for cheating by a roommate who also stole his girlfriend.  One day, Chuck gets an email from his old roommate, which mysteriously implants a secret intelligence database known as the Intersect inside his head.Suddenly, Chuck must lead a double-life,  By day, he labors in the BuyMore with his offbeat co-workers, including his slacker best buddy Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez).  By night, and sometimes by day, he is a CIA asset.  He is ""handled"" by CIA agent Sarah Walker (attractive Australian actress Yvonne Strahovski) and hardnosed NSA assassin Major John Casey (Adam Baldwin).The Intersect causes Chuck to ""flash"" on various passing clues, prompting a weeky mission to foil some villian and his or her dastardly plot.  Invariably, the untrained and inept Chuck is told to ""wait in the car"" while Sarah and Casey pursue the bad guys.  Also invariably, Chuck ventures from the car and either needs rescuing or bumbles his way into rescuing his handlers.  Even though played tongue in cheek, the action sequences can get quite tense.At the heart of the series is the slowly evolving relationship between Chuck and Sarah, who as cover for her role as bodyguard, poses as his girlfriend.  For the totally smitten Chuck, this pseudo relationship is ""complicated.""  The highly professional Sarah is not quite able to avoid developing feelings for the good hearted, decent and loyal Chuck.  Their efforts to pass off their relationship in front of Chuck's family and co-workers are the source of endless comedy and some genuinely touching moments.""Chuck: The Complete First Season"" is very highly recommended as outstanding entertainment, just a little reminiscent of the old ""Get Smart"" series in an updated way.  Chuck has been renewed for a full second season of 22 episodes; the action and the romantic comedy continue."
"NBC's CHUCK is such a welcome surprise and one of the best and funniest TV shows I've seen in a while, something which normally is an omen for immediate cancellation (but, thankfully, NBC picked it up for the full season). CHUCK achieves that heady mix of humor, action, espionage, and even a dash of romance (or pining, to be more exact). And it'll have you rooting for the nerd hero Chuck Bartowski, the physically hapless but nonetheless invaluable new member of the U.S. secret agent fraternity. Whereas, before, Chuck was someone who for thrills lived life vicariously thru video games and films, he's all of a sudden forced to cope with experiencing the very intense real thing.Several SPOILERS follow.The 411 on the premise and plot: A rogue CIA agent, just before being killed, downloads a wealth of top secret government files into the brain of his old college roommate Chuck Bartowski, a seemingly disastrous choice at first blush. Chuck is a social misfit, a computer geek who toils at the Nerd Herd electronics department of the Buy More supermarket. His support system consists of his best bud Morgan, who's even more of a loser than Chuck, and Chuck's lovely, protective sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster), who is perpetually concerned for him and his lack of a social life. That Chuck lives with Ellie and her laid back boyfriend, Captain Awesome, doesn't exactly win him points with the cool set. But, for Chuck, things are about to change.Chuck meets Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski), who seems to really like him. But Sarah is really a CIA agent sent to wrest the stolen intel from him. Finding out that the top secret data is imbedded in his noggin, she is then assigned to keep tabs on him. To do so, Sarah works at Wienerlicious and poses as Chuck's chica. Meanwhile, the NSA trots out its top operative, the no-nonsense John Casey (the awesome Adam Baldwin), who as cover hires on as a Buy More sales clerk.Nowadays, danger and intrigue lurk at every corner for Chuck Bartowski, who finds himself leading a double life and is now sometimes referred to as the Intersect (mostly by Casey). He speedily proves his value when the data in his brain enables him to put two and two together and uncover an assassination attempt. Soon, he's tangling with ninjas, shadowy agents, terrorists, and bombs - and that's just in the first episode. Further shows would unveil even greater peril and more mystery. Seeds of distrust are sown as Chuck also struggles with the constant hedging and fabrication brought on by his CIA and NSA minders. More importantly, despite obstacles put up by his nemesis, the evil Asian dude Harold Tang (okay, he's not really evil...but he's bald), Chuck's trying out for the assistant manager gig at the Buy More. Good luck, Chuck.End SPOILERS.CHUCK is a consistently funny, funny show doubling as a straight-up spy thriller. There are plenty of slick, potent action sequences, but the heart of the series is the comic fish-out-of-water premise of the geek caught in serious cloak-and-dagger environs. The show provides a steady dosage of nerd/slacker humor which always has me smiling for the duration of the episodes. And, instead of Chuck suddenly developing kung fu skills, the series makes sure that Chuck remains inept and a bit cowardly (Chuck would prefer to refer to it as being ""prudent""). Zachary Levi as Chuck is wonderfully straight-faced yet has that comic timing down pat. He's very sympathetic as a guy whose big heart is shyly on his sleeve.Which leads us to another focal point of the show: Chuck's tentative relationship with the beautiful Sarah, who as a spy is forever on her guard and who's still grieving over her recent past with a fellow agent. But there's a connection between her and our favorite Nerd Herder, as Sarah realizes that Chuck really is a most decent dude. But only time will tell if it pans out. Australian Yvonne Strahovski is well cast as the lethal and accomplished secret agent, who can kick enemy agent heinie even a she dances sensuously with a clueless partner (yes, that would be Chuck). Yet Strahovski, when called for, can lend a torn, vulnerable air to her calculating superspy (check out ""Chuck versus the Nemesis"" to see just how conflicted she becomes). And, holy ministrone, she's hot! On the other hand, I don't think the looming Adam Baldwin is hot, but he's one of my favorite dudes to watch on TV. Fans of Joss Whedon will remember Baldwin from his memorable recurring roles in ANGEL and FIREFLY. Here, he makes for an intimidating sales clerk and government spy.I am currently in solid geek heaven with CHUCK. Here's hoping NBC continues to support this show for a busload of seasons. Here's to Chuck (and friends) waging war against irate Buy More patrons, staving off calculating co-workers, and also fending off some of the most diabolical enemies of America, mom, and apple pie. And all that while shouldering the stigma of a dead-end job. Way to go, Chuck!"
"This is one of the better series to have appeared lately. Chuck is one of the Nerd Herd at Buy More who gets the complete memory of a supercomputer downloaded into his brain. He ends up being chased and protected by some secret agents, one who of course is a pretty blonde. You see the thing. But while this might have been a complete failure, the creators of the series have managed to come up with one of the successes of TV of lately."
"Chuck Bartowski's (Zachary Levi) life was going no where fast.  True, he is head of the Nerd Herd at his local Buy More.  But he lives with his sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) and her boyfriend Devon (aka Captain Awesome, played by Ryan McPartlin).  His best friend is Morgan (Joshua Gomez), a fellow nerd who also works at Buy More.But things change drastically when Chuck gets an e-mail from former friend Bryce Larkin.  The e-mail contains all the files of the intersect, the complete intelligence files of both the CIA and the NSA.  And, to make things more exciting, Bryce has destroyed the original files.All the information gets downloaded into Chuck's brain, making him a highly valuable government secret.  So valuable that he has two bodyguards, Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski), a CIA agent who pretends to be Chuck's girlfriend, and John Casey (Adam Baldwin), a NSA who moves in next door to Chuck and takes a job at Buy More.Whenever Chuck sees something from the intersect, he flashes on more information.  Unfortunately, these flashes are at random and uncontrollable.  And Los Angeles seems to be a hot bed of activity.  Even with two agents guarding him, Chuck finds himself in over his head with his new life as a spy.  Can he survive and keep his secret?Yeah, yeah, I know what you're thinking.  The premise sounds unbelievable.  And if you stop and think about it, it is.  Fortunately, the show never gives you time to think.  They cram everything into these episodes.  There's action and intrigue, developing storylines involving the intersect and Chuck's past, romance with Sarah that she is not willing to admit is there, and plenty of laughs.  Many of the laughs come from the sub-plots focused on the Buy More.  But we also get laughs from Chuck's reaction to his new world.But in case this all sounds disjointed, let me assure you it works beautifully.  Everything is balanced and blended so that it seamlessly flows from one event to the next.  And the characters are outstanding.  Honestly, that is what holds all of this together.  Even gruff Casey is fun when it comes down to it.If, by some chance, you missed this show when it premiered last fall, correct that now.  You'll be hooked by the time the second episode is over and watching them as fast as you can.  Personally, I can hardly wait for season 2 to start."
"I really enjoy Chuck. He is Everyman, caught up in situations beyond his sphere of experience. But Chuck rises to every occasion--often with fear and trembling--and somehow survives. The cast, many of whom were new to me, is great."
"If you want an awesomely funny everyman show, pop this one in the DVD player, sit back and just enjoy the absurdity, emotion and action."
"... but I can't think of anything to add that hasn't already been said.  It's a wonderful show, a clever blend of humor, romance, and action.  Great acting, great characters, etc.  I'm writing this mostly because I've been re-reading Cerebus and I just had to give 5 stars to a show I bet Dave Sim doesn't like.  Hehehe."
"The show is great.  It's geeky but not too geeky, it's funny but serious and action packed too.  I like the casting, Chuck is great.This episode sets up the premise for the entire series well and I can't wait to see what the rest of the season holds.  I'll be setting up a season pass for this one!"
"Charles ""Chuck"" Bartowski is an average guy working in the electronics department of the local BuyMore - average job, average friends, average life. He lives with his sister Ellie and her boyfriend Devon, and though both are lovely and supportive, the fact that they're both doctors (and that Devon is aptly-nicknamed ""Captain Awesome"") means that they're a constant reminder of Chuck's inability to get his life together. He's still hung-up over getting kicked out of university after his best friend Bryce Larkin framed him for cheating on an exam - and stole his girlfriend along the way.But then one day, completely out of the blue, Chuck gets an e-mail from Bryce. He opens it, and unwittingly has an entire database of government secrets downloaded into his head. Turns out that Bryce was a rogue spy for the CIA, and the last thing he managed to do before his death was send the stolen file to Chuck's computer.Now whenever he sees someone or something that's connected to international espionage, he has ""flashes"" that warn him of various criminals, terrorists and assassins in his midst (of which there seems to be a surprising amount in his neighbourhood). Enter Sarah Walker and John Casey. The former is a CIA agent that's been sent to find the missing data by feigning romantic interest in him, only to release that it's hidden within Chuck's brain. The latter is an intimidating NSA operative (and the man who shot Bryce) who is incredulous at the thought a man like Chuck could have a super-computer implanted in his brain.The two of them are relegated to monitoring Chuck (Casey as a BuyMore sales clerk, Sarah in the Wienerlicious across the road), occasionally drawing him into operations when they're in need of the specialized information stored inside his head. Just to add a little intrigue to the proceedings, Sarah poses as Chuck's girlfriend - given that she's stunning, all of Chuck's family and co-workers think he's hit the jackpot.Needless to say, you'll need to suspend your disbelief if you're going to enjoy ""Chuck"". MoreGet SmartthanSpooks, moreJames BondthanThe Bourne Identity, this show plays around with the spy genre, infusing it with comedy, action-sequences, pratfalls, wisecracks and romantic complications. Most of the premise is based on Chuck's fish-out-of-water experiences in the world of espionage, and thankfully the writers don't feel the need to turn him into an expert any time soon. Armed with only his technological know-how and sheer dumb luck, Chuck occasionally gets to save the day, though the heroics are usually left to the professionals.It's only in the relationships that things are taken a bit more seriously. Chuck pines for Sarah, but she has a dark history of her own that's gradually revealed over the course of the thirteen-episode first season. Comic relief characters such as Morgan Grimes (Chuck's best friend) and Captain Awesome are given moments of pathos and three-dimensionality. Chuck's relationship with his beloved sister is strained when his double-life starts interfering with hers. And eventually it transpires that there was more to Chuck's expulsion from university than he first realized.""Chuck"" managed to survive the Writer's Strike and went on to run for five seasons, bourn up by the breezy writing and the versatile acting. Australian Yvonne Strahovski is a real beauty, but manages to combine the lethal efficiency of her character with a real warmth and vulnerability, whilst Adam Baldwin was a shoe-in for the role of John Casey (he's basically slightly-less psychotic version of Jayne fromFirefly). Sarah Lancaster is a joy as Chuck's older sister, and Joshua Gomez manages to make Morgan's obsession with Chuck's life not quite as creepy as it sounds. But it's really Zachary Levi that carries the show as the sweet-natured, in-over-his-head Chuck, who is simultaneously delighted and terrified by the new direction his life has taken.It's all tailor-made escapism for your average twenty-something nerd, in which a shy and self-effacing everyman is treated to wild adventures and a gorgeous love interest, but with an overarching plot that plasters over some of the more one-off silliness."
"Warning!  Spoilers!CHUCK VERSUS THE NEMESIS is the latest in a string of very nice episodes.  I've not been charmed by everything in this series.  There are fans of the show who love Morgan and those who utterly detest him.  I'm of the latter camp.  And early in the season I almost gave up on the show due to the series initial emphasis on standalone episodes couples with more Morgan than I could tolerate.  But there has been slightly less Morgan (a little of him goes a very, very, very long way) and far more in the way of a serial structure to the show.  As a result, my interest has gone up sharply.This episode picks up from the previous one, in which Sarah kissed Chuck, only to discover that her former lover/CIA partner Bryce was still alive.  Obviously, this complicates everything.  I'll keep the spoilers light except to add that the episode ends with Sarah being forced to choose between staying on her assignment with Chuck or going off with Bryce.  Given that she has a longterm contract on the show, there isn't a great deal of tension.  The question obviously isn't whether Sarah will end up staying, but under what conditions.I'm coming to like this show more and more as the ongoing story continues.  I'm really delighted that it has not persisted in offering nothing but standalone episodes.  I've mentioned in many reviews that the one massive advantage TV has over the movies is the serial format.  A TV series can develop a narrative and provide character development that no movie ever made can even remotely hope to match.  Shows that turn their backs on that natural superiority of TV to movies do not receive my respect."
I enjoyed the first episode (pilot) of Chuck when it first aired on NBC. I became a fan and watched it until the show ended. Season one was one of the best seasons and I am glad I own it.
"There's everything in the world to love about this series - great plotline, excellent character development, witty dialogue, great soundtrack, and incredibly inventive premise.  All of the actors from the primary players to the support cast does an excellent job.Chuck - the leader of the Nerd Herders at the Buy More gets an email from his former college roommate.  The email downloads a super computer into Chuck's brain.  Suddenly Chuck (a likable but aimless college dropout) becomes one of the CIA's most important assets.  To protect Chuck the CIA and NSA bring in two specialists - Sarah and John Casey.  The entire series becomes what happens to a normal old, every day guy when something really extraordinary drops into his life.  Throw in a little spy danger, some romance, and some crazy family and friends and you've got Chuck."
"This show at first looked a bit laughable to me, but I assure you this is a well conceived series. All the actors have been chosen with great care, and they interact with one another as though they had been working with eachother their entire lives. They have great chemistry in every scene, it's like they're best friends in real life. The show has alot of comedy which is only broken up by action and dramatic story telling. What I love about the show is it's many references to movies, television, and video games. Chuck is not James Bond, not even close in fact. It is hilarious watching him try to fit into the world of espionage. He does have two bodyguards Sarah and Casey to protect him. Sarah is a beautiful blonde agent that is sent to be his girlfriend (lucky guy), and Casey is the heavy artillery side of the team. It's really fun to see Chucks and Sarah's relationship grow throughout the season. They clearly have great chemistry and that leads to some romantic moments. It's sorta like on LOST with Jack and Kate you know they want to be with each other but the plot dictates otherwise just teasing you here and there. Chuck also has a best friend Morgan who is responsible for most of the laughs as we watch his pathetic life, and the way he clings to Chuck's every move. Chuck and his family really keep the show grounded and really relatable to the every day guy. This show began well and only got better in season 2.The picture quality is another thing all together. It has grain in almost every frame. The picture is just filled with noise almost the entire time. It really is distracting and is quite disappointing. Chuck surpasses the picture quality with it's amazing characters and stories. The extras are decent with some deleted scenes, a gag reel, and audition footage.  The series is a mix of Alias, Mission Impossible, and Get Smart. It is the ultimate comedy hour mixed with great action."
"Yes, my inner-geek rejoiced minutes into the first episode of Chuck:S1, with the reference to Prince's ""Batdance"" song.  Constant pop-culture references are just one of the things that makes Chuck about the best show on TV and probably too smart to last very long.The cast is fantastic: from Chuck himself to Big Mike, Captain Awesome, Morgan, and even the cameo roles, everyone is well written with depth. Adam Baldwin is one of the most underappreciated comedic actors in Hollywood. Its a damn funny show, but more than that, it includes a little bit of everything, from suprisingly solid action to a dab of romance.My main worry is how long they can sustain the show's formula, from Chuck's memory flashes/missions to the tension between he and Yvonne Strahovski.  But I will be there for the whole ride."
The premise is not something I remember being done before now. It  has been brought to life with consumate skill by Damian Lewis and Sarah Sahi as well as Adam Arkin.Watch it and decide for yourself.
It is a catchy plot line similar to The Finder. I enjoy the mind games Crews comes up with. The plots were good and kept me interested.
"Often you have to give new shows a while to warm up,  and episode 4 or 5 is much better than the pilot.  But Life really knocks it out of the park from the first episode and it doesn't go downhill at all.  I'm so sorry that this series didn't really make it,  because I loved it. Charlie Crews is a fascinating character, complex,  striving.  I loved the 'Zen' theme.  The series as a whole has 2 streams - the overarching who set up Charlie and killed his friends,  and the week to week cases and both are excellent.Watch it, you'll want to watch the rest."
Great casting.Fascinating lead character and gripping plots as well as an interesting background story unfolding..I can't wait for the next episode.
Unique show. Can't wait to see how season 1 ends.
"Life Season 1 has great characters, excellent acting, and a plot that keeps you wanting to go on to the next episode.  Season 2 is every bit as fascinating."
A lighthearted detective series with well played characters.  Even though it concerns murders the show is full of lighthearted dialog.and the characters work work together.
"My wife and I watched all of Seasons 1 and 2, and found them to be entertaining, funny, and very enjoyable.  I particularly liked the fact that the show represented two people, acting as partners, who found each other interesting, but not sexually irresistable.  I was very sorry to learn that there was nothing after Season 2.  Surprising.  I would have thought that finding sponsors for this show would have been easy.  Maybe too many Christians afraid of Zen."
"I will be so shocked if NBC doesn't do a season 3, this is such a fantastic show. This is a quality show. I adore a quirky, unique charachter (but not in a Monk way, ugh). This show is fantastic, wonderful actors and superb writting. I've seen every episode and will be buying the DVDs for my collection."
"Who was Damian Lewis anyhow?  W O W what a dynamic character as Detective Charlie Crews in the TV series &#34;Live.&#34;  NBC really dropped the ball by letting this series go with only two seasons.  NBC blames the 2007-2008 Writers Guild strike by cutting the first season to only 11 episodes.  NBC started the second season on Monday then flipped it to Friday, back to Monday, then back to Friday and eventually to Wednesdays I think.  I loved it but I couldn't find it most of the time.  There are 21 episodes for the second and sadly last season of &#34;LIFE.&#34;  Regardless, we have an albeit short first season but it is a block buster.  LIFE is a show that should have been a multi-season series.  NBC was harassed by idiot reviewers who couldn't see through their thick glassed windows having been scratched by watching too much TV for their prior reviews.  LIFE is and will always be a classic.  Damian Lewis and Sarah Shahi has a 'pop your eyes out' magnetic on screen performances.  The best recurring actor was Garret Dillahunt as Roman Nevikov.  Roman is the greatest hope for a TV nemesis ever.  Introduced in the first season, you will find him back in full force in season two.  They did wrap up the series successfully in season two.  When the final episode &#34;One&#34; aired April 8, 2009, the music was remarkable.  Thankfully, I had the episode recorded so I could identify the songs. Soon, I learned that the DVDs and all future airings of the last episode would never have the original songs.  Today, when you watch the last episode &#34;One&#34; you will find the ending flat due to the ridiculous faux pas of NBCs license for the songs. None-the-less, LIFE is a spectacular &#34;32-episode&#34; series that will always be in the hearts of viewers who worked hard to find it."
"This is a good show and the only thing I don't like is there are so few episodes.  The character is very Zen but he wields a lot of power.  He is played well by the actor.  Sorry, I am very poor at remembering names but the show is very good."
"Charlie Crews trough Damian Lewis approaches detective work through a combination of intelligence, in zen. Wrongfully imprisoned the shows always has a great lead case and solving his own is advanced. It is the greatest shame this show was not picked up ongoing. I&#8217;ve watched it 3 times since it was cancelled."
Discovered this quite by accident and watched the entire season in one weekend.  Love the interaction between Crewes and Reese and the mystery within a mystery concept.
"Life has a good pace, is clever and ironic, with likable characters. It is not the nasty bloodbath you see in so many shows these days."
"Compelling, funny moments, great characters, excellent casting & performances. Really good writing! Just finished my second run through this season. I don't often replay episodics, but this one is THAT GOOD!"
"I haven't watched TV in years-got fed up with the high cost-low return from the various cable/satellite companies available.  I do watch some of the shows available online offered by the different networks on their sites. Amazon happened to offer the first episode of Life free.  Free is a good thing and also a great way to gain viewers like myself.  I am hooked.  ""Life"" is not your run of the mill cop show.  Charlie is not your run of the mill cop.  I own season 1 on DVD and have already pre-ordered season 2(have to love Amazon's price guarantee)and season 2 is a must see and in my case must own.  If you haven't seen Life you haven't lived."
"Quirky, clever, and very satisfying, Life is an excellent police procedural that takes place in Los Angeles. LAPD detective partners Crews and Reese are perfect foils, seeming opposites that play off each other's best and worst personality traits in such a way that the viewer ends up liking both characters, a difficult feat. Actors Lewis and Shahi do an excellent job. Lewis' American accent is spot on, and Shahi (a very beautiful woman) does the tough-cop, no-nonsense, recovering addict role just right. Other characters/actors are also great. Although I wanted the series to go on and on (it was cancelled), please don't be hesitant to watch the 2 seasons that are available. The underlying mystery, developed a little at a time through each episode, is satisfyingly (if perhaps not completely) resolved at the end. I watched the last episode last night, and I'm a little sad now. I will miss Crews and Reese."
A story that lets you follow without complications or convoluted stories. Easy to get hooked. a different anti-hero but very entertaining.
"This is definitely one of the most interesting and intriguing crime dramas I have seen in a long time.Too bad it only lasted two seasons.  I love the main character with his Zen philosophy, which made for some very nice creative lines from the writers."
Loved it on TV but missed some episodes. Was nice to be able to watch the whole thing. Don't know why they didn't keep it going.
I like how off the wall the show was.  It was very entertaining.  I have shared this show with several friends.
"unlike anything else you've ever seen anywhere.ahead of it's time.funny and deep at the same time.season 1 was short because of the WGA strike and the show never found it's audience.  for a show this different, one and a half seasons wasn't enough."
"""Life: Season One"" is something completely different in a police procedural.  Charlie Crews is an L.A. cop who spent 12 years in prison for a mass murder for which he was framed.  Sprung from prison by a crusading attorney, Crews is back on the police force with a promotion to detective and a multi-million dollar legal settlement.The show operates on several levels.  Charlie Crews must readjust to life on the outside, where there is sunshine, fresh fruit, unfamiliar technology, and a large empty mansion to live in.  His wife and his former life are gone, although not entirely.  He approaches his new job from a unique angle, shaped by the Zen philosophy he adopted to survive inside.The police force has decidedly mixed feelings about his return; his new partner, Dani Reese, is a recovering substance abuser under pressure from their chain of command to find a excuse to get rid of him. She is also the daughter of a retired policeman who may have been responsible for Charlie's frame-up.The cases in each episodes would be fairly ordinary but for Charlie's Zen angle, which allows him both insight and compassion. In one heartwrenching confrontation, Charlie is forced to shoot an armed and dangerous suspect, then comforts the dying man by convincing him he is only having a bad dream.Charlie's secret crusade to unravel the conspiracy that put him in jail gives him ruthless enemies who seem uncannily aware of his every move.  Each episode teeters on the knife-edge tension that Charlie can be sent back to jail or even killed if he gets too close to the truth.  Charlie gets help from his former cellmate, a white collar criminal; his attorney, who dangerously mixes a professional and a personal relationship with Charlie; and his ex-wife, who has considerable guilt over divorcing Charlie in prison.""Life: Season One"" is very highly recommended as a different kind of police procedural.  British actor Damian Lewis carries off Charlie Crews with a grounded, offbeat charm.  The early episodes are a little jarring, counterpointing Charlie's new life with the one he lost.  However, the series settles into a good rythmn, building to a hard-hitting season finale."
We really enjoyed every minute of this show!!  The acting was great and the story line sure keeps you interested.  We are looking forward to watching Season 2.
"I just sort of stumbled onto this show, was pretty hooked after the pilot, each episode got better and better. I really enjoyed the multi-plot format, wittiness, twists & turns, and for the most part, I was surprised. Kept watching episode after episode, 3 am, time for bed! LOL Too bad there weren't more than 2 seasons."
I found this show very interesting...only seen 3 episodes so far but I've enjoyed the storylines. I would recommend it
This program was excellent in both character development and plot.  The interlocking quest of the main character throughout all episodes and the obvious faults of all three chief role players kept one's interest right through to the end of season two and leaves one hoping for more.  Why such a superior show as Life should discontinue production after two seasons while meaningless senselessness goes on season after season after season is an intellectual puzzlement.
"Once again, a unique show, with great writing and acting, is killed off before it has a chance to build an audience.  I somehow missed this show completely when it originally aired back in '07-'08.  This indicates to me how little this show had to have been promoted when it initially aired.  I discovered it only recently on streaming Netflix and I believe the second evening I began watching it I got so hooked I sat up watching episodes until nine o'clock the following morning.  I could not believe a network show this good only lasted two seasons and got such low ratings.  Damien Lewis and Sarah Shahi made for a great detective duo and each episode was incredibly well written with unique plot lines. I had never seen a show with so many great guest stars that I never seen anywhere else before. All facets of this show just screamed QUALITY and ORIGINALITY, but not surprisingly this meant a death knell for LIFE.  A similar type show with a similar fate was last years PRIME SUSPECT with Maria Bello.  It didn't even last a full season, I don't think.  So if you want to guarantee a brief tenure for your new show, simply hire quality actors and writers and it'll be gone before you know it.  Congrats again to you network execs!  And you wonder why your audiences have been decreasing year after year.  In the word(s) of Homer Simpson (AS WELL AS NETWORK PROGRAMMING EXPERTS).........DOH!!!!"
....trust me.  Is it perfect?  No.  But at 19.99 its a steal considering what is being charged for other formulaic cop shows of much lesser value.
"LIFE the tv series was only on two seasons, 2007-2009.  I missed it then and am soh so glad I found it now.  Just finished season one and will order season two.  So very well done.  Rand Ravich gets my kudos for a job well done.  LIFE is a cop show, centering on Det. Charlie Crews.  who is just released from a twelve year prison term, as new evidence clears him  His settlement, great wealth and be a cop again.  We follow week to week stories and Charlies quest to find out who set him up.  Very good supporting cast with Sarah Shabi as his partner and Adam Arkin, as friend and financial advisor, oh, a fellow con.  Try this series.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
"This is a fantastic, compelling, thrilling show.....all the actors are seared onto the screen.....there are so many layers and plots, twists and turns......the prison/police work tension....it just all works very well !"
"I liked this show and wish it were still being produced. The lead character is a smart former policeman (detective) who was wrongfully convicted of a crime and served, what, 12 years in the pen until he was exonerated and released. He wins a wrongful conviction suit and becomes rich but goes back to being a policeman. He got through the time in the pen by learning and practicing zen and by being smart. Now he brings that smartness and zen quality to the job of detective. As he goes about his detective duties he is also trying to figure out who set him up for the conviction. It is quirky and unusual - a rich detective, who as a very different outlook on life, is smart, and brings a very unusual philosophy of life to his work. Highly entertaining lead character."
Loved  it and bought Season 2 but slightly disappointed in the turn of events regarding the character inter-actions on Season 2.
He was not the best choice for the part I do not think. Not the type to draw a lot of women to the show. It is like the heat of the night . They never figured out that all the women where tuning in to see Bubba not the star. lol My pop came in and said you gals watching Carol O conner and my mom and I both said at the same time No Bubba . and grinned at each other. And we had never said to each other that. lol
keeps my interest.  Pleased not to see a whole lot of fighting and car chases.  So far not recurring methdology being played out.
"Damian Lewis plays a good part.. I enjoyed most of the story lines not to heavy, and no bad language..such a nice feature."
A little quirky at times.  The lead character is definitely quirky but in a good way.  The homicides can be a little quirky and weird but it makes for an interesting show.  The characters are strong and the actors are good.  Sad to see only 2 seasons to watch and nearly done with Season 2 but I've enjoyed it.
"Touching, transcendent, witty, snappy, thoughtful fun.  The female cop character is too mean, closed-minded, and coddled by all the males around her but Sarah Shahi performance is serviceable, and she is extremely pretty.  The Adam Arkin character is a total winner.The 2nd season's plot lines go off the rails, then the series was cancelled, but the first season of 'Life' is procedural perfection."
"Have only watched Season 1 so far, and I love this show! Damien Lewis is fantastic. I would loved to have been able to just sit and watch this show straight thru because it is that good, but I had to settle for watching it over about 2 weeks time. Can't wait to watch season 2!"
"The pile of manure being the innumerable other cop shows out there that do the same exact thing. How on earth do all of them have viewership's? They don't deserve them. They are fairly unoriginal.Not so with Life. It is delightful. The style and such of the cinematography is sleek but unique, a hard combination to come by.The writing is so much fun. One minute deadly serious. One minute laugh out loud funny. And always sharp no matter what.Acting is incredible in every way. Story is fun.Watch this instead of those other shows that are simply boring and tired."
"My wife and I had never heard of this series, but found it on Amazon Prime.  The male lead is recognizable from the hit cable series &#34;Homeland.&#34;  Yes, it's another cop detective drama and there's always a murder to solve.  But there are enough other quirky plot twists and the murders also have twists.  You find out right away that the male lead detective was himself framed and spent 12 years in prison for a murder he did not commit.  So these various parallel plots and plot twists keep it very interesting. The acting is good and there is also an element of humor.  So all in all, it is a very entertaining series that makes you want to keep watching it."
It started out very new and really different.  It just got better.  Like the &#34;people&#34; and also the &#34;police &#34; work was still brought into the storyline.  Do like to have more of that - and less of the personal &#34;stuff&#34; - not watching a &#34;soap&#34;.  Too bad the show apparently did notstay on long.
"I had watched part of the first episode a while back but decided against it for one reason or another and then I forgot about it.  Recently I saw it come up again and decided to give it a second chance.  Am I ever glad I did.  I love this show!  I really like the format of it - the way the characters' actions and dialogue are set up.  Adding Alan Arkin to the cast was an excellent choice.  He's such a good actor as is the main character Charlie, played by Damian Lewis, who plays this insightful man who is so grateful for the simple things in life having been in prison for many years for a crime he did not commit.  Very refreshing!"
I loved this show!  I watched the first season in sequence and then followed it w/ season 2.  This is another fine tv show that falls victim to corporate poor choices in not finding an audience to keep it on the air for more than 2 season.  Highly recommend.
I was remarkably sorry to only see 2 seasons of this show. I enjoyed watching so much. I made a marathon and viewed both seasons over about 2 days. Fantastic and full of engaging acting. Lots of talent.
"Loved this series.  Interesting, different, wonderful performances and very well directed.  Couldn't ask for more.  Look forward very much to season 2!"
This show was a real &#34;sleeper&#34;.  The main characters were excellent and played off each other very well.  It's to bad the series ended after 2 seasons.
"Stories on multiple levels, good characters and good timing. Peel an onion, Russian dolls, take your pick for how each episode advances multiple story lines. The cars add some metallic spice."
"It appears that this program only lasted two seasons..I like Damian Lewis very much, the premise of the show is interesting and I enjoy the relationship he (Lewis) has with his new partner, Reese.  Adam Arkin also plays an interesting character.."
"It had everything, great chemistry, mystery and spirituality. The one show that makes you want to listen to buddhist meditation tapes."
"Season one was great, surprises without being super strange, decent characters, nice story progression while keeping each episode interesting.Season two is what killed this show though, bringing in the new character as a love interest for the partner was a joke, not that they brought someone in, but who and how.  Other than that the second season is worth watching too."
"Too bad it only lasted 2 seasons.  However, they did wrap everything up nicely in the 2nd season for it."
Love this show. Wish it had continued
"It's funny, serious, and well done.  If your looking for great entertainment you need to watch this series. Season 2 is just as good."
"Another Damien Lewis triumph.  I've been impressed with this guy since he did the two mini-series The Forsyth Saga and Band of Brothers.  Band of Brothers was a stand-out performance since he was a Brit playing an American officer of the 101st Airborne.  Nicely done by him and he is a coming actor.  Just needs the right launch pad.  Life is a good choice.  It has a great hook and the right quirkyness to make it really interesting and not like the usual drivel on American telly . . . the rest of the cast is good as well and with the continued good writing this show has a chance to succeed where most shows fail if they don't have CSI or Law and Order as part of their title.  So, if you want to watch something different and not the usual display of bullets entering a human body and puncturing various organs close-up this is a good one.  Life is good."
"Quick Overview: Detective Crews was sentenced and served years in prison for a crime he is now exonerated for. He received a hefty settlement but decided to return to his work where he got a new partner. Together they solve murders. When he is alone, he is tries to solve the murder he was put away for.Love the Life television series. I don't know how I missed it when it was airing. Damian Lewis is great. His character, Crews, is eccentric but smart. He often looks like he is about to board the crazy train and then suddenly it all makes sense. Then he does it again! He is a little crazy and a little genius. Pretty obnoxious sometimes too."
"Life is one of the freshest new shows on TV right now. I love the main character, I love Adam Arkin's character, I just cannot recommend this series highly enough.The zen take on everything really makes this an offbeat yet engaging cop series."
"I was not sure of this show so I took a chance and watched the first episode, it was a fresh look at crime drama.  A cop, wrongly accused (not so surprising a plot----aren't they always???) but still I continued watching.  The interesting hook was that he not only took the references huge settlement but had negotiated to keep his old job as a detective in the same place that accused, arrested, prosecuted and jailed him.  Hmmmmm, different. The humor is a sideline to a jaundiced look at the new/former workplace and although I think the female partner's role is a bit over the top, the cases are interesting and the tracking of who actually committed the crime he went to prison for is well thought out and executed. Thank you.&#8203;"
"An excellent ensemble cast.  Damien Lewis is magnificent.  When this became available through Amazon Prime, I rabidly devoured an episode...and then another...and then all of a sudden, Season 1 was over and I wondered at how deeply engrossed I became in Charlie's story and how much I had grown to care about him and his partner, Danni.  So now I was craving to know even more of Charlie Crews, et al. An excellent ensemble cast.  Damien Lewis is magnificent.  Now it on to season two."
"I enjoyed LIFE season 1 so much, that I also watched season 2.  The writers didn't leave the viewers hanging as to who the real killer was, but there was enough mystery left to make us look forward to season 2.  I like the chemistry and rapport between partners Crews and Reese.  I'm glad to see that both actors (Lewis and Shahi) have found other projects.  Adam Arkin was good as Crews' financial advisor."
great police show. the show is based on a policemen wrongfully sent to prison. Upon his release he rejoins the department. As he does his daily job he tries to find out who framed him
"This was a great series, too bad it's gone. Sarah Shahi and Damien Lewis were perfect in their roles. Great off center cop show. The crime scenes were always interesting and reminded me of the openings to another great series ""dead like me""."
The actor in the lead role is convincing in his character. All the episodes are fast paced and keep you wondering what will happen.
I loved this story and hope they were able to close up the questions in Season2.  It's a very unique story of police corruption.
"I love detective/police based shows.  I found this to be one that caused me to stay up nights watching until I got to the end.  I am now absorbed in Season 2.  Sadly, apparently this show ended after only two seasons.  I recommend it to everyone who enjoys this type of show."
"Every once in a while, you stumble across a really fresh, well-written, well-directed, well-acted TV series.  This is it!  Fully engaging...  watched the entire series in 3 days... and went looking for more.  Found &#34;Season 2&#34;!  Yahoo!"
Truly a finders delight....well done...humorous...realistic...charisma and interaction between characters fascinating. Premise seemed far fetched but well played out in Season 2.
"Love the writing, love the characters, and am sorry to find out they only made two seasons. Wish I had watched this when it was on the air. Bring it back for a season three!"
Simply one of the best most well written TV series. I am not going to go into the allegories it is comedy and suspense with a past and a (you would think) a future. Sadly it was dropped by the networks even though I understand it had very good numbers. In all probability it was dropped by some 30 year old noodle-head the top brass thought had brains. Life: good acting great plot watch the whole two year life of the show.
This is one of the best series I've seen.  It's great to watch the streaming so I can watch episodes when I want.  The premise is different from all the usual cop shows.  The acting is good.  I like the characters.  Each episode has a complete case plus something is added to the backstory.
"I have greatly enjoyed watching this show and in fact have watched both seasons twice - yes, it's that good in my opinion. The Charlie Crews character, played by Damion Lewis was brilliantly acted and his partner, Detective Reese (Sarah Shahi), is equally as good. They are remarkably good together once they get passed all the &#34;issues&#34; each of them brings to the partnership. Adam Arkin adds humor as Ted Early, a white collar criminal, to the show as Charlie's old prison mate, whom he protected while they were in prison and invited to live with him and manage the huge settlement Charlie received for wrongful conviction. Charlie's old partner, Officer Bobby Stark, played by the ever fascinating Brent Sexton, rounds out the odd main character cast. Watching Charlie readjust to life outside prison, working with a new partner and solve cases has proved irresistible. Excellent acting by all in developing characters that, to me, are just too irresistible and engaging. That this show was cancelled after only 2 seasons, while absolutely dreadful shows were allowed to continue, demonstrated that NBC lost their touch for gauging the difference between what constitutes good writing in TV land and what does not. Season 1 and 2 are both terrifically written and acted. Kudos to Lewis, Shahi, Arkin, and Sexton for a job well done if greatly unappreciated."
"I am so sad that this series was cancelled...it could have gone on and on as far as I am concerned.  Very good story premise, wonderful scripts and the chemistry with all the actors was superb especially Crews and Reese!"
"The twist here is that detective Charlie Crews was put in jail for 12 years for a crime that he did not commit.  Imagine going through all  of that and then going back into the police force.  His wife has remarried, and some people still will not admit that he is innocent.  Add to this a partner who does not want to be with him, and you've got a man with some issues.  But he tries to handle them with Zen philosophy.  He also has a constant hankering for fresh fruit, since he never got any in prison.Damian Lewis is sympathetic and likeable as Crews, while Adam Arkin is in solid form as his roommate and former inmate-pal.  He helps to handle Crews' enormous settlement.A nice show with interesting characters. Fans of Deadwood will enjoy Robin Weigert in the role of the commander of the police officers."
I'm on the second season now and highly enjoy the show. Shame they took it off. Had a lot going for it.
"In the pilot, the look and feel of this show does for the Bionic Woman, what they did for Battlestar on the Sci-Fi channel( if not quite as gritty). Where as the original was just silly, this seems (so far) as a well thought out story, with people that we may come to care about for (good or ill).The subplots, of Jamie's reletionships with her sister, and evil crazy counterpart, for me (at least so far) make for good drama.They've got my interest, I just hope the show lives up to the pilot."
"I was a huge fan of The Bionic Woman and The Six Million Dollar Man...sooooI was excited and skeptical about this show being made.  However, I purchased the DVD set and then read the reviews.  I agree with some of the reviewers about the problem this series faced.  The comparison to the original, the lack of continuity, etc.  However, I feel this show is being way to harshyl judged.  While I can see the problems of this show, I feel that in time the kinks would have been worked out....there were only 8 episodes from what I can tell and find out and the chemistry between all the characters was spot on right out of the gate.  I feel it would have only got better.  The show was still finding its legs when the strike happened.  How long could this show have gone?  That is anyone's guess, but if the strike had not happened, I certainly think it would have continued for several years.  I personally enjoy seeing Sarah, she, to me, is much more colorful and 3 dimensional than the other characters....I just have to say, over all, I am glad that I bought this set, I would have continued watching the show based on what I have seen and watched objectively, I don't think anyone could disagree with this."
"This episode shows the kind of potential that THE BIONIC WOMAN has and is easily the best so far.  The widely reported rumor is that there has been disarray on the set of the show.  The good news is that NBC seems to be a big believer in the show and has taken every possible effort to make it a success.  The other bit of good news is that the show is already quite good, even if in disarray.  Now, it is also perfectly possible that things were confused on the set, but that many of the difficulties were solved by excellent editing.  But if one didn't know from other sources that the production is supposed to be a bit of a mess, you wouldn't be able to tell by the finished episode.  After a few episodes show runner Glen Morgan left the show.  Jason Katims, who is the executive producer of FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, has been taken on as a consulting producer.  I've read also that a number of FNL writers have gotten involved with THE BIONIC WOMAN.  NBC clearly thinks this show could be a hit for several years.Clearly, NBC's reaction to THE BIONIC WOMAN shows the beginning of a trend in responding to productions that have some onset confusion.  The prototype was last year's BROTHERS AND SISTERS, which by all accounts was simply a god awful mess.  The initial show runner quit over creative differences (she is now the show runner, ironically, for the show that runs opposite THE BIONIC WOMAN, ABC's PRIVATE PRACTICE) and NBC was forced to put together a new production team.  The result was a completely rejuvenated program, one that by the end of the year was enjoying both respect by critics and dedication by fans (of which, I must confess, I am not one).All of which excites me.  If THE BIONIC WOMAN is this good while the production team was not a smooth running machine, what will it be like once it is tuned up?This episode lays out what will clearly be a major story arc on the show, the strained but unbreakable connection between Jaime Sommers and Sarah Corvus.  Some people have complained about Michelle Ryan's performance as Jaime, but I think she has been fine and that she will get even better as her character is allowed to develop more confidence.  I think the problem is not Michelle Ryan, but that Katee Sackhoff's performance as Sarah Corvus is just so spectacularly good that she makes everyone around her look bad in comparison.  Sarah Corvus dominates every scene she is in, much the way that on BUFFY Faith and Spike tended to take over when they put in an appearance.My one concern with the series at this point is how good it is going to be when we get less Sarah Corvus.  THE BIONIC WOMAN started filming before BATTLESTAR GALACTICA did, so that Katee Sackhoff, who plays Starbuck on the latter, was available for early episodes.  At some point we will inevitably see less Sarah.  My understanding is that Sackhoff's boss, David Eick, is working with her to keep her involved with THE BIONIC WOMAN as much as possible while BSG wraps up and having both shows film in Vancouver certainly helps.  Still, at least for a while Sarah will have to play a diminished role.  But one thing seems certain:  no performer on television will play such a crucial role on two series this year as Katee Sackhoff.All in all, I think this episode was a big improvement over the second one.  I liked the pilot, but the second episode was a tad flat.  Hopefully this episode is a sign of things to come."
"I found myself becoming more interested as the plot lines evolved. The new show has brought in more technology than the original series, while keeping the theme similar. This version is darker and has more edge than the first series. The younger sister started out slightly shallow, but the need of having her watched by older adults was addressed early on in the series Now I think that both ""sisters"" are developing their sibling roles nicely. The actors that support Michelle Ryan have developed into a fine ensemble of people. I would like to see more of Mark Sheppard in future episodes. There are also danglers of plot in each episode. I hope the show continues. It has turned out to be a show I look forward to watching on my PC."
Chuck is the best show ever!! The nerd gets the superpowers and the girl. What more could you want? Ok Zack Levi is also really cute and has the personality to match. This is one of my favorite shows - the nerd is the hero. What more could you want? Don't miss out on this series!
"What can I say, the combination between the goofy but martial arts skilled Chuck, his super hot superspy wife Sarah Walker, and the cast of characters such as Casey and Morgan make it a great show! Highly recommend buying all seasons if you did not think you would like it when it was on TV, I think you'd be surprised!"
such a big fan of the show.  it and the characters actually GREW rather than just got stuck in the non-ending situation syndrome. this final season was a great send-off.  worth every penny to me
"After watching the first 4 seasons of Chuck, I just HAD to get the last season as well - and it was money well spent. It was a little sad knowing the series end was coming, but the writers did a good job of keeping the action flowing right up to the end. All of the characters seemed to get their special moments during this season - the only character I missed was Anna from the early seasons.I don't want to spoil anyone's surprise, but we get a few visits and flashbacks to old characters, as well as a few new ones along the way. Most of the Chuck fans should be happy with the ending as well. Boy, it is ahrd to talk about this season without giving something away, so I will just summarize:If you watched the first four seasons, this season falls nicely in-line, but with a wrap-up in the final show instead of a cliff-hanger season ender."
"For the final season of ""Chuck"", producers Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak faced a daunting dramatic challenge: how to generate new drama, comedy and romance for a great show.  After all, at the end of season four, nice guy CIA agent Chuck Bartkowski (Zachary Levy) finally married his lovely CIA partner Sara Walker (Yvonne Strahovski), after protecting the birth of niece Clara to sister Ellie and brother-in-law Captain Awesome.  Operation Bartkowski was officially ended, leaving Chuck, Sara, gruff NSA agent John Casey (Adam Baldwin), and Chuck's best friend Morgan (Joshua Gomez) without a mission.  The solution: reshuffle the deck.Using money from Alexei Volkov, last season's leading villain, Chuck, Sara, Casey, and Morgan go into the private spy business, only to discover the competition can be quite fierce.  Carrie-Anne Moss (Matrix) has a recurring role as the cutthroat leader of a rival firm, and as someone with a history, and maybe a future, with Casey.  Morgan, who ended up last season with the Intersect in his head, discovers the hard way the challenges of having super spy skills, and in the process damages his relationship with Casey's daughter Alex.  Chuck, reduced to basic nice guy computer nerd, goes through his own period of painful adjustment, before having to face his greatest opponent one more time.  Sara Walker's long-missing mother will make an appearance at a vital moment, while fans will be treated to additional fun with the BuyMore gang, and to additional Bartkowski family comedy (and drama over Chuck and Sara's future).Team Bartkowski will face a series of threats from rogue CIA agents, including one who sets up the team for the crime of the century, leaving the team with a choice of jail or life on the run.  In a tense multi-episode conclusion, Chuck and Sara will battle one last ruthless opponent for control of the Intersect and everything they have built together.  The suspense will be good to the last drop.""Chuck: The Complete Fifth Season"" has the last 13 episodes of the show and is highly recommended to its dedicated fans.  The DVD set includes the usual blooper reel, deleted scenes, and a few farewell features."
I loved this series. I hated to see all the problems with keeping this series on the air. I will miss this show.
"This show I really enjoyed (except the ""evil american agencies"" bit is wearing very thin to me) a funny show without a laugh track is always a plus to me. I don't know if they will find enough material to write to keep me engaged, but the pilot was pretty entertaing, (the action sequence in the biggining was pretty exciting, and the rest pretty funny.I hope they can keep it up.Update November 27, 2007This show has pleasingly gotten better each week. The Characters are more developed and sympathetic.  And while this may not go down in TV history as one of the greatest shows of all time, it continues to be a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend an hour."
I was really hoping this show would make another season but alas it was not to be.  I am still buying subs and hoping though.Wendy Farrington is the reason this show ran as long as it did.  She came up with the Save Chuck subway campaign.Wendy thank you for your efforts.
The dvd arrived promptly and in perfect shape.  NOTE: SPOILER ALERT!!!!  I was very disppointed that Sara would lose her memory and she and Chuck would bascially have to start their relationship all over again. The writers couldn't have made it a happy ending for the two of them-come on...
"This is a great new show. The show has excellent oddball humor and great lines. The characters are hilarious and they have made great scene sequences (e.g. Casey getting the cutomer service tutorial) and Chuck just draws you in into his predicament. I especially enjoy when he talks to Sarah about their fake relatiosnhip, if that relationship were in fact real, they would go on a date. Chuck is just a great show, a must watch. The show has refenreces to video games that are fun to figure out. The cast is very amusing and entertaining. The only people that seem out of place are Chuck's sister and her boyfriend or husband, Captain Awesome.UPDATE 11/19/2007:This show is still great. I can't wait for Monday nights to watch this show. The relationships between Chuck and Sarah is so exciting. Every episode, every new development and every character adds even more excitement and fun to this show. And Rachel Bilson's character is great. This show has everything going for it: great and funny dialogue, great performances, amazing chemistry among the characters and great and unbelievable storylines."
Season 5 of Chuck. Wow. I am sad it is over. The production values were high until the end. Still kept the same humor and action mix. I shall miss it.
"We the fans were lucky to get this final season. The writers and actors knew this as well and pulled out all the stops for the end of this saga. I thought season four was good but a little lacking when compared to the previous seasons. This season however was excellent. The guest stars were impressive as always with Carrie Anne Moss, Mark Hammil, Bo Derek, and many others that made for a pop culture flashback. This season centered on Carmichael industries and how Chuck, Sarah, and Casey were on there own. Oh and also Morgan has the Intersect and Chuck does not. I was a little worried about how this would play out but the writers did an excellent job giving the storyline meaning and depth. I won't go into detail but it was an interesting ride with Morgan Grimes having the Intersect.Also Chuck and Sarah shared a lot of post marriage problems like starting a family and finding a house. It was cool to see these two try to figure out married life while shooting some bad guys. Casey gets a love interest in Carrie Anne Moss which was a nice touch for the gruff Colonel, and wouldn't you know it there was a Matrix reference added for her. The ending while a little controversial was excellent in my opinion. Anyone about to watch the finale should watch the pilot right before it. There are a lot of references to Chuck's first mission. There will also be an extended version of the finale along with audio commentary for the episode (It's about time). Even if you didn't like the finale at least the writers got to end the show on their terms.I'm rating this in advance of buying it because I think we all know it isn't going to look great on Blu Ray. It never has been the standard for high definition. I doubt things will change now. This will be however is the best it is going to look for a while so I will gladly add it to my collection next to the previous four seasons.The final season of Chuck was a wild ride until the final smash to black. It brought back a lot of favorite characters including a previous villain, new characters were seamlessly added to the mix, and the focus never shifted too far from the main cast. Which did an excellent job once again. Zachary Levi deserves an Emmy for his performance in the finale. I said the same for Matthew Fox for LOST and he was robbed. I hope Chuck at least gets a nomination. The final episode will be debated for a long time, but you owe it to yourself to experience the final season of Chuck. In the Pilot Chuck said he was working on his five year plan. Well Chuck your five years on television were some of the most memorable in recent memories and your final missions were just as enjoyable as your first."
"K. Watlet (another reviewer) is crazy!  This was an excellent story!  I really don't see how it will remain interesting as a series but it would have made an excellent miniseries or movie.  The acting was real, the camera angles were good, the shifting back and forth through time was done very well and there were times I didn't know which time he was in.  The only reason I watched it is because it was free and I am so glad that I did!"
"From what I can tell, Journeyman has gone the way of a lot of promising shows before it with low ratings. It's too bad as this show was starting to hit its stride, and had shaken my initial perception as a Quantum Leap ripoff. To the credit of the producers, the final filmed episode, ""Perfidia,"" offers a neat enough closure to the series that fans won't feel cheated. Hopefully, the Sci Fi channel or some other cable outlet will pick up the show--it deserves another chance."
"Journeyman looks to be another series with promise. I watched the Unbox download of the Pilot episode, and... If you don't just hate the idea of a show with time traveling involved, this should be a good series for thinking people.The premise seems to be somewhere in a mix of ""Quantum Leap"" (at least the part of fixing what is screwed up with the timeline) but more ""The Time Traveler's Wife, and Ken Grimwood's ""Replay"".Mid ~Season Update November 27, 2007Journeyman is meeting all my expectations for the shows development. I remain hooked!The make or break for this show will be do the real world characters generate enough empathy to hook you on the show, and will the ""fix it"" parts of the plot be interesting.I think there is a good chance they can make this work. I hope I am right."
"Journeyman is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the BEST television shows ever produced. The concept of Journeyman is brilliant, the marketing was abysmal, the ratings were satisfactory for a freshman show, the over-all quality of Journeyman is superb. But don't think Journeyman is just a show about time travel. It's so much more. Journeyman is a show about a heroes. Dan Vasser is the hero who goes back in time to help right wrongs. Livia is his hero partner who helps him. Katie Vasser is his hero wife who, through no fault of her own, finds herself married to a time-traveling man who, coincidently is time traveling with his ex-girlfriend. This show could have taken so many low roads with this issue. But never once did it slip into the little nasty things other shows use to pull people in - illicit sex, bad language, drug addiction. Journeyman was one of the few shows in many years that showed humanity at its best. We need MORE shows like this, not less. Why NBC canceled Journeyman is a mystery to many, many fans who continue to proliferate all over the internet, months after this show was canceled. I say to NBC: remember Star Trek? Now, FOX owns the rights to this show. We can hope that Fox does a better job and has more respect for this diamond of a show that got coal treatment. For the fans of Journeyman, WE were the ones who lost. But NBC? They deserve to be in fourth place amongst the networks. They are the real losers here. Thank YOU FOX and UNBOX for offering us the sale of the thirteen episodes of this fine show. Now...as for the DVD...?"
Good thing I have a DVR b/c a lot of time was spent rewinding to rewatch the parts I didn't get the first time around.
When I was watching the pilot episode I wasnt sure if I was going to like the show. Then everything fell together at the end of the pilot and I have been hook on the show ever since.  The acting is great and the time jumping gives you the blast from the past feeling.
"This show first developed the backgrounds of the characters really well and added the sci-fi elements as a spice to the series. The creaters of the show have selected ""family members"" of the main characters ""Dan & Katie"" who manage to be very similar in features to the two main characters. I think the show has done a superb job of recreating the past of San Francisco and the cultural elements of the years that the main character, Dan, travels too. The stories flow together creating a nice arc of the family interactions and current cultural dynamics mixed with good sci-fi based on quantium theory that the viewer can actually believe. There is a balance between the good that Dan does and the sinister aspect of being watched by the government in recent story lines. While each show can be a stand alone episode, I enjoy watching this show and learning  more about the characters' challenges with the concepts of Sci-fi that influence the show each week. It's also nice to see a family demonstrating love and support of each other for a change."
"This is a great first season, so fresh and fun! the characters are sometimes ridiculous but you root for them because they are still lovable. Great cast dynamic! Excellent!"
"I 1st got turned on to this show by my wife. I'm glad in did. This show is pure genius. Once you start watching it, you will be sucked in. This show is very well done and since you are hooked, you will need more. If you are a fan of comedy go get some."
At first I thought this might be way tooo nerdy but honestly after a few episodes I'm really enjoying the series.  It's light yet portrays an Aspie really well.
Very funny sitcom about a group of friends who don't fit in with mass culture.  I liked how each character is very similiar yet different from eachother.  Sheldon has been my favorite since the sperm bank when he explains about producing a child who doesn't know if he should use an intergral or differential to find the area between curves.
"""Frasier"", arguably the greatest sitcom of all time and known widely as the most intelligent, sadly came to an end in 2004. Dedicated fans of the sitcom were sat wondering what to do next. Myself alike, we simply didn't know what to do with ourselves, we searched frantically for an equally intelligent sitcom alternative which simply didn't exist. Some of us suffered withdrawal symptoms and eventually got over them, while others simply withered away and died whilst huddling in a corner rocking back and forth waiting for ""Frasier"" to come back. He never did.Three years later and Chuck Lorre finally came to the rescue and brought us the utterly fantastic ""Big Bang Theory."" No, not the theory of the beginning of the universe and everything in it, but rather the most fantastically amusing and intelligent situational comedy to grace our screens since the equally fantastic ""Frasier."" It's a show much like Frasier that doesn't seek to just pop out one gag at a time, much like a stand up comedy performance, more rather it will create a genuinely hysterical situation from the simplest of things. It is made this amusing thanks to the fantastic writing, acting and non-patronising tone of the whole thing.The show is primarily based around four super intelligent stereotypical nerds and their blonde bimbo neighbour played by the wonderful Kaley Cuoco. The four nerds are the closest of friends and comprise of Sheldon played by Jim Parsons, Leonard played by Johnny Galecki, Howard played by Simon Helberg and Rajesh played by Kunal Nayyar. Each character has their own fantastic quirks that makes them individually a quality addition to the whole ensemble. Specifically Sheldon who is the genuine super genius of the group that contains not an ounce of modesty about his intelligence or his work. Parsons presents an almost seemless character that exhibits the general unease in modern society that you would expect from someone of such an academic nature, yet amongst his peers  exhumes a confidence that portrays an obvious annoyance amongst his room mate and closest friends.Looking at the general synopsis of the show you would be forgiven for thinking that it's a simple ""boy meets girl, boy likes girl, but girl is too good for boy, but boy doesn't realise it so keeps chasing her."" Throughout a lot of the first season this is definitely portrayed, but it done in such a subtle way that it avoids the annoyance that would no doubt make it a cliche.  This is more about the intelligent banter between the two main friends of the four, Sheldon and Leonard. Leonard is the more down to Earth character, and although a bit of an outcast in his own right, feels the embarassment that such heightened levels of intelligence and geekyness that he possesses which Sheldon seems to look past.Much like ""Frasier"", this presents an extremely intelligent cast and some genuinely good acting along with presenting the prolongued fish out of water idea rather than weekly random situation that would create a string of gags. The acting within is superb and although the characters may seem quite transparent, there's the potential to have much more depth revealed from within. Kaley Cuoco is the unlikely candidate for this as although the last time I personally saw her was playing generally the same type of character in ""8 Simple Rules"", she expresses genuine potential of a great actress and she displayed her great acting skills in the scenes of ""8 Simple Rules"" following the untimely death of the legend John Ritter. Although that may have been fueled by genuine emotion, she delivered her lines with the same confidence and prowess we had become used to whilst playing to the Daughter who lost her Father story.If we get some emotional scenes, then I expect her to be on the front lines of acting within them. Other than the want of some genuine emotion, there's nothing negative I can say about this show. Throughout it uses a genuinely intelligent script that doesn't patronise the viewer by trying to explain everything they're talking about, or presenting a ""moral of the story is..."" angle to each episode. It gets a strong recommendation and I have to ask that if you haven't seen it already, then the question has to be asked. What the hell have you been doing with yourself?"
"Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper are very smart scientist living together in an apartment  in New York City. They are not very popular and their only friends are fellow scientist Rajnesh (Raj) Koothrappali and Howard Wolowitz who often come over to play games.Then Penny moves in across the way and Leonard has a massive crush on her. The show details how their lives collide each learning from the other, often with very funny consequences."
"This is a great show that just keeps getting better and better.  The writing is very clever and characters are a riot.  I can't get enough of this show, and get a laugh out of it every time I see it, even the reruns.  One of the most original and funny shows to come around in a long long time.I'm happy to see this out on DVD and hope the show continues.  If you haven't seen the show watch a few episodes.  I think you'll  like it."
I really enjoyed this show.  It gets 5 stars from me because I lost count of how many times I laughed out loud.  This show has definite potential!  I will definitely watch this one.
"I don't think I have busted a gut watching a comedy series until watching ""The Big Bang Theory"".  What a wonderful and hilarious series coming from the minds of Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady.The series is about two physicists Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon (Jim Parsons) who live in an apartment together.  One day, they get a new neighbor with Penny, a blonde and beautiful woman from Nebraska who has come to California for a better life but after a bad breakup, finds friendship with Leonard and his friends.Joining Leonard and Sheldon are their two best friends Howard (Simon Helberg), a perverted and horny brainiac and Rajesh (Kunal Nayyar), another brainiac but has a problem with his inability to speak with beautiful girls.What makes this comedy work so well are the character dynamics and each of their quirks.  Especially the character of Sheldon who is just the most anal geek among the three but Parson's Sheldon just is incredible.  Included in this season 1 box set are a total of 17 episodes.1. Pilot - Penny moves into the building and Leonard who is smitten by her agrees to get back her TV from her muscle-bound ex.2. The Big Bran Hypothesis - Leonard is addicted to cleanliness and organization and can't stand Penny's messy room, so he sneaks into her room during the early morning to organize her room.3. The Fuzzy Boots Corollary - Leonard has a date with Penny but she doesn't know it's a date.4. The Luminous Fish Effect - Sheldon gets fired from work and decides to stay at home, concocting experiments and annoying everyone.5. The Hamburger Postulate - Leonard's not sure if he'll ever become Penny's boyfriend, so he and a fellow co-worker decide to have sex, while Sheldon doesn't know what to do when his roommate is having sex in their apartment.6. The Middle Earth Paradigm - Penny's having a Halloween party and all the guys are invited including her ex who picks on Leonard.7. The Dumpling Paradox - What happens when Howard gets lucky with Penny's friend?8. The Grasshopper Experiment - Rajesh finds a way to get over his inability to speak to a woman but what happens when his parents plan an arranged marriage and he has to meet with this woman.9. The Cooper-Hofstadter Polarization - Leonard and Sheldon are invited to present their physics findings but instead leads to a fight between the two.10. The Loobenfeld Decay - Sheldon can't tell a lie, so he puts Leonard in a odd situation.11. The Pancake Batter Anomaly - Sheldon is sick and the guys start to panic and go in hiding, leaving Sheldon with Penny.12. The Jerusalem Quality - A child prodigy comes to the campus and Sheldon is feeling threatened by him.13. The Bat Jar Conjecture - It's time for the physics bowl team and Sheldon is the MVP.14. The Nerdvana Ahhihilation - What happens when Leonard orders a (very large) time machine from a film.15. The Pork Chop Indeterminacy - Sheldon's twin arrives and the guys fall for her.16. The Peanut Reaction - It's Leonard's birthday but what happens when he and Wolowitz get an allergic reaction from eating peanuts.17. The Tangerine Factor - Leonard and Penny go on their first date.AUDIO AND VIDEO:The audio is stereo and nothing major since the show is primarily all dialogue.  As for the video, the earlier episodes has a bit of graininess to it.  I thought maybe playing the disc on a Blu-ray player maybe showing a lot of noise but I checked the disc on another player and it seems that the first few episodes just had a bit of it.  But fortunately, not all of it are like that.  If anything, you see it moreso on the pilot.SPECIAL FEATURES:The DVD box set unfortunately doesn't have too many special features.  Included is a featurette titled ""Quantum Mechanics of The Big Bang Theory: A Behind-the-Scenes Look Into Geek Chic"".  The 20-minutes featurette features interviews with the creators Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady and also the cast.What I found interesting about the featurette was learning how the show was created, how the actors were selected and the use of science in the show.I've always wondered what would happen on television with a lot of the sitcoms now nearly all gone from television except on syndication.  But I have to admit that Monday nights on CBS has become my favorite night thanks to ""The Big Bang Theory"" and ""How I Met Your Mother"".I have to admit that ""The Big Bang Theory"" is just so enjoyable to me because of my enjoyment of super heroes, comic books,  technology, video games, science, etc.  Although these guys are more on the extremeness of geekiness, I can't help but love the show.  It's absolutely one of the best sitcoms right now and for a comedy series, I don't think I have laughed so much since ""Seinfeld"".You can find this season 1 set for a great price and I definitely recommend this TV series!  Give it a try, you'll love it!"
"When this series came out I watched the pilot episodes and laughed so hard that my housemate thought that there was something wrong with me.  I could completely identify with every character in this sitcom and found a very synchronous connection between the characters, the living spaces and work environment and what I had experienced in my life in a former job.  Sheldon's overt Asperger's Syndrome adds an element of humor that allows us to laugh at ""smart"" people without feeling uncomfortable and out of line.  The timing, writing and character development is done very well on this show and it just continues to blossom from one season to the next.If you are looking for a new, quirky sitcom that turns science on it's head at times .... you may find yourself enjoying ""The Big Bang  Theory"" the way I did those first episodes.  I remember laughing so hard I thought I was going to break a rib.  The newness and very succinct humor really got me good.  If you work in a science background and among scientists ... you will find humor in this great show.I love it!"
This season movie I thought was great. I love all of The Big Bang Theory shows and watch them over and over whenever I want a great laugh! Sheldon and Penny make the show but they all are really great acting nerds!
Wow! Who knew this show would be such a hit? It is a mainstay in out TV line up. Good laughs and fun.
I never get tired of this show. I think it will go down in history with a following like Seinfeld!
This sitcom is bad ass! Its funny as hell! I will be getting all seasons! Plus it came extra quick and came in excellent condition!
"I bought this as a gift for my step-mother who had been wanting to watch the show.  She was hesitant to catch re-runs on tv starting in the middle, so I surprised her with the first season.  This season, more than the others, does take a warming up period.  But, that can be said for any new show.  Funny as all get out!  You won't be disappointed with Big Bang!"
This show is hilarious! I highly recommend to any and all who enjoy a good laugh and don't mind a sexual innuendo here and there.
Love the Big Bang Theory!  So handy to have a couple of episodes downloaded on my kindle for when I travel
"Our whole family loves this hilarious ensemble comedy show.Sheldon is an eccentric physicist with Nobel Prize potential and limited social skills.  His roommate, Leonard, is a run-of-the-mill genius by comparison; also brilliant, but self-aware enough to know there is more to life than physics research.  Their social group is rounded out by Raj, another physicist who is to shy to talk when women are present (unless he has had a few drinks) and Howard, the mere engineer of the group.  These four friends are fairly content to watch science fiction films, collect action figures, and chase girls unsuccessfully . . . until they meet the girl next door (literally), Penny, the aspiring actress and ""dumb blonde"" who can teach these four brilliant scientists a thing or two about enjoying life.The characters are all likeable and relatable in their own ways and mostly nice to one another.You might think these characters are over the top, but I have met enough geeks to know that people like this really do exist . . . and really are entertaining.Fun for the whole family; we haven't yet seen an episode that didn't make us laugh out loud!"
"When you meet this group of genius nerds, you will be hooked on The Big Bang Theory!  Dr. Sheldon Cooper is played BRILLIANTLY (excuse the pun) by Jim Parsons and has more quirks than a hedgehog has spikes (but he's not crazy, ""his mom had him tested!"")  Penny (their ""normal"" neighbor) is adorable and charming and has the patience of a saint while putting up with her very strange group of friends.  This is an intelligently written sit-com.  I highly recommend this series!"
"Sure, we have the creators of this show that came up with the concept and, to be sure, there are the characters that bring the show to life... but who really have the brains overall? Believe it or not, even though they're total brainiacs, it's not Sheldon or his totally egotistic roommate Sheldon (who has issues galore), I do believe it's their blonde neighbor, Penny, who definitely knows how to portray common sense effectively. And in each episode, where misadventures fire up all the time, I couldn't help but laugh my jaw off at each antic, especially the failed tactics of the live person counterpart of Pepy Lepew- Howard Horowitz. Almost felt like I needed a death certificate for laughing so hard each time.As for Sheldon's attitude and cold, distant, nonpersonal way... I laughed real hard at what happens to him at the Physics Bowl (who would've guessed a janitor could actually be smart?). Not to mention Rajesh finding a way to actually talk to women (make that two, though I don't think the side effects will be wanted), oh, and can't forget Leslie Winkler and her forward, somewhat off-putting, yet very well-done character as the female version of the guys. And the chemistry between Leonard and Penny may be obvious, but it also works, very, very well. It's not blaring, it works equally with all the nerdish humor- his intelligence and awkwardness with her charm and ditziness. And if this is just the start-up, then let the bigger laughs begin when I get to season 2."
"I love this show---the characters are so three dimensional and believable.  kudos to the writers---it's an exceptional show!I tried to write and tell them that Sheldon would never say, ""smarter than me"" which he does in the Dennis Kim episode when he's talking to Howard.  It's ""smarter than I"" and Sheldon knows that.  If anyone knows how to reach the writers, pass it along."
"Started by watching reruns - never even considered it before...what was I thinking?  This is the 1st TV show ever, ever, ever that makes me Laugh Out Loud!  (I Never laugh out loud)  I'm now addicted & watch every chance I can.  Love each, but the ""Soft Kitty"" scenes w/Sheldon & Penny..."
"My real pleasure in this sitcom is watching the interplay between the chief geeks: Leonard, who wants to be normal, and Sheldon, who disdains normality.  Perhaps that's why this show has such a following: many brainy types find themselves torn between wanting to fit into the human race, and having little interest in being ordinary.  I teach at the university level, so I see this basic pattern play out among my colleagues every working day.Leonard has fallen for Penny, the pretty aspiring actress living across the hall.  Sheldon has a very narrow range of interests, in which he continually tries to improve himself, but little concern for anything outside his comfort zone.  Leonard would love to shut off the ideas constantly whizzing around his brain.  Sheldon would love to shut off the world and retreat into those ideas for the rest of his life.  Neither one can have what he wants.These brainiacs attract a huge audience, I contend, because real-life brainy types have both these paradigms at play simultaneously.  I'd love, like Sheldon, to care nothing for sex or approval, and just do what fulfills me.  But I'd also love, like Leonard, to reach outside myself and join the human race as an equal.  Sadly, I can do neither.  So I, and studious geeks worldwide, will sit back and watch these nerds fight that battle for me."
"Utterly hilariously funny. And wonder of wonders just as funny the 3rd time around. My girl-friend, who has no comics or SF interests, got hooked on it two and we've just finished the 2nd viewing of it - at her insistence. No wonder this show consistently pulls in over 14 million viewers every week."
"Leonard, Penny, Raj, Howard, Sheldon make this the best show on TV. No swearing, somewhat educational, geeks rule is a great message. Will buy every season ever made."
This is a great series and It is different from anything that is on TV these days and i like that about this series!
We purchased the first season used and it arrived quickly and in great shape and with the correct number and of discs and the correct season one discs included. We just became interested in the show and wanted to catch up by watching previous seasons so we've purchased each season and enjoy watching and rewatching them.
"So, okay, I love the concept and execution of the set. It's a simple set with a single Blu-Ray format case housing first the Blu discs, then the DVDs, and coming with a single UV redemption code for the whole season in high def.It comes with a couple bonus features on both the Blu / DVD discs (last disc, I think?)...Overall, I like the execution. I think this is how things should generally be released going forward. Kudos on that, WB! Blu for high def, DVD for low-def or for sharing with friends who haven't yet upgraded and UV for online streaming or downloadable personal digital copy. Kind of like future-proofing. Makes sense to me.However, I'll note that, for whatever reason, the 'high def' video quality doesn't seem all that great. Especially watching on UV via VUDU (haven't tried yet via CinemaNow to see if the same problems persist via a different UV ecosystem provider). It's especially apparent on the pilot episode, but seems endemic. While it's high def there seem to be lots of compression artifacts abounding making he picture look pretty poor quality, especially noticeable on my 60"" TV when you get right up close. It looks pretty bad...So, I put in the Blu-Ray just to compare. It looks *a bit better* on Blu-Ray proper, but there's still quite a bit of graininess. So, I'm a bit disappointed. I don't know if it's 'cause the original was shot at lower def and upgraded, or whether the transfer just wasn't done cleanly from film or whatever.I haven't yet looked closely at season 2 Blu's yet to see if the problems persist with the transfer. I'll take a look more closely at some point and find out.Overall, though, I love the set and the show itself. And since one sits the better part of 8-10 feet away from the screen the artifacts aren't terribly noticeable at that distance. Right up close it's VERY noticeable, especially streaming, probably due to compression algorithms being somewhat 'lossy?' But I can forgive it sin ethe overall set is great.Can't wait for Seasons 3-4 to update to the Blu+DVD+UV format, since it looks like they were originally released in Blu-only format (no DVD or UV). Once you ship 'em that way (combo pack), I'll pick 'em up, very few questions asked. As long as they're done as well as these are. I'm all for it! And the combo-ness is a good thing, sinec my friend who loves the show hasn't yet upgraded to a Blu-ray player and he LOVES the show too, so with the combo pack, we can still enjoy them over at his place and laugh our butts off for hours on end. Thanks! That's all!"
"I got the first season of The Big Bang Theory for Christmas and I have to say that I haven't laughed this hard at a television show in a long time. I heard good things about it, but I could never fit it into my DVR's schedule without getting rid of some other shows that I like. The cast of four nerds and a hot blonde is perfect and the writers have to be just as smart as the main characters to come up with such intricate and funny dialogue. This show is enjoyable even if you don't get all the tech geek talk, but if you understand why one of the characters playing Halo 3 gets pissed off and killed because he got a Needler weapon, then this show will blow your mind."
"Sheldon: Okay, who's on lithium?Leonard: Huh?Sheldon: Look at our logo.  Three electrons orbiting the nucleus.  If you look at the CGI atom that appears between scene changes, the nucleus consists of six spheres, 3 neutrons and 3 protons, although why one of them is pink and another one is gold is beyond me-Penny: I think the pink one is supposed to be me.Sheldon: That would almost make sense, but then why 6 spheres? There are only 5 of us.  In any event, this is clearly a lithium atom.Howard: Actually, as a matter of fact, I used to be on lithium.  Now I'm on Prozac.Leonard: It's not supposed to represent lithium, it's just supposed to represent...atoms, and..stuff.Sheldon: ""Atoms and stuff?""  Then it's meaningless.  It's gaudy and comical.  If we are to have a logo, it should be something we can respect.Leonard: Thank you, Dr. Manhattan.Sheldon: I'm serious!  We need to get this logo changed to something actually relevant to the big bang theory.Raj (whispers to Howard, smiling.)Howard: Well, maybe, but how would you turn that into a logo?Raj (whispers some more)Howard: Hmm...Nah, I don't think she'd go for itPenny: No. She wouldn't.Sheldon: You all are talking about coitus, aren't you?If you think any of the above is remotely humorous, get this series.  It's even better."
"I recently moved to Thailand to teach and there is little to watch in English on t.v. I overheard some co-workers discussing how funny the show is, so I bought the first season DVD. It is so funny I finally had to stop eating while watching to avoid choking, so I bought the other two seasons. Right now I'm trying to figure out how to download season 4 to my PC. I've watched all three seasons several times and it still makes me choke on food, but I suppose eventually I'll get tired of it and stop laughing. Hasn't happened yet, though."
"Being geeks and sci-fi/fantasy fans, the wife and I enjoy the humor of the Big Bang Theory and a lot of the &#34;in&#34; jokes, spoofs, cameos, and general chemistry among all the actors and the situations they get themselves into."
"When this series first aired I thought it would be a typical clone series of Friends or Joey or the like but to my surprise and happiness I found it actually has a talented and entertaining cast who keep the series more enjoyable as each season comes out.  I like how it plays on the seemingly stereotypical lifestyles of the vastly intelligent but socially awkward and socially talented but slight less intelligent academically and not always in the same group as you would think.  Many people have wondered if the series has a laugh track like some of the early 80's to mid 90's shows, while you do hear laughter it's actually from an audience rather then a mechanical laugh track.Still if you find it annoying to hear laughter in some of the scenes then this series is one you might want to pass over, while it doesn't distract you from what's going on in the scenes more then half the episodes will have for obvious reasons laughing in them. If you're still unsure of the series I'd say get the first season especially for the price it's going for and see whether or not you will become a fan as I highly suspect or this is a series you'll want to pass over either way I still say the series is worth a try."
Finally a comedy that provides food for thought! This DVD also has a few extras at the end. Should be a big hit for college grads & faculty.
"What can I add about this very clever and hilarious TV series, which I just discovered even though it's in its sixth season, when there are already 441 reviews posted here? Probably not much but I'll try.Though the Complete First Season has been released before, a new ""Combo Pack"" is now out (as of July 10th) with both Blu-ray AND DVD versions plus the new Ultra Violet concept - all in one package. (So you will never be without a chance to watch these episodes again and again.). For those folks who complained that the only ""bonus"" in the original First Season set was the ""Quantum Mechanics of The Big Bang Theory"" featurette, you'll be happy to know that they added a gag reel this time. I'm not sure that is enough to replace your earlier set but it's a nice bonus for those - like me - just discovering it.There's no reason to go into the plot of the show - again, it's covered in other reviews - but I did notice that after the first for or five episodes (which at 22 minutes - no commercials - are like potato chips: you can't stop with just one) the characters changes in odd ways. Leonard seems less nerdy and Penny less overtly sexy (plus she must have lost her job at The Cheesecake Factory because by the fourth episode or so she is serving the ""guys"" at a local hamburger place in a non-TCCF uniform.The ONLY thing I found a bit of a downer - and I don't see it mentioned in other reviews - is that the series uses a ""laugh track"" which was very popular in the 1960s before TV comedies started being recorded in front of live audiences. It is really annoying because it sounds phony and you will hear the same laughter over and over, sometimes even before the punch line. It bothered me a lot during the first three episodes but I guess I got used to it a little as time went on. It's just too bad that they felt need to use these.So, I'm jumping on the bandwagon for this series and in the process of ""catching up"". If you've read this review before the others, I hope I've encouraged you to scroll down and read some more. Better yet, just sample an episode and , like me, I'm sure you will get hooked!I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic"""
This show has more laughs than clowns at a circus.  Great adult humor.  Now my wife and I are both hooked.
Great show. Saw it on tv  about half way thru season. Top show. Funny. Something just about everyone likes. Good quality disc.
"Focusing on the lives of physicists, and geeky ones at that, does make for an atypical television series, but a great cast, original characters, and high quality writing, combine to produce a modern comedic gem.  Created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, it understandably took a little while for the creative team to develop the personalities of the characters.  But once the basic parameters were set, The Big Bang Theory began to boldly go where no comedy has gone before.With characters that always seem to be evolving, the series explores some unusual topics, and frequently heads into uncharted territory, usually making it impossible to predict what may happen.  This is one of the main reasons why this unique, goofy, show is so hilarious and captivating.  The creative team taps into facets of pop culture that may be associated with geeks and nerds (and teenage boys in general), and find ways to weave them into their stories, often in an exaggerated way.  Science fiction, comic books, superheroes, video games, television, action figures, paint ball fights, Star Wars, and the Star Trek universe, are just a few of the subjects that are featured.The cast is marvelous, with Johnny Galecki as Leonard Hofstadter, the shy guy enchanted by his new neighbor.  Jim Parsons is Sheldon Cooper.  If you look up the word neurotic, Sheldon's photo just might be there.  Simon Helberg is Howard Wolowitz, the delusional sleaze, who does still have his good points.  Kunal Nayyar is Rajesh Koothrappali, who can't speak to a beautiful woman unless he is under the influence of alcohol.  Kaley Cuoco is Penny, the girl from Omaha who moved next door, works at the Cheesecake Factory . . . . and changed their universe.Since Sheldon is off the scale when it comes to weirdness (what Penny would later come to describe as `whackadoodle'), and Wolowitz and Raj are arguably more `abnormal', Leonard seems the most sensible of the bunch.  Sheldon is totally unique, so bizarre in his beliefs, behavior and speech, that he seems at times to be from another planet.  Jim Parsons is a amazing comic talent, with a bright, bright future.Penny has a multi-faceted role.  One is as the primary female character, another is that she usually represents as close to a 'normal' persons' point of view as we will get.  As a link to reality, she is often the reference that shows just how wacked out the guys really are.  The times when she joins them in their world (such as when she fragged Sheldon on Halo night), are often some of the program's funniest moments.  By the end of the season, everything about the show is clearly peaking.  In `The Pancake Batter Anomaly', Sheldon gets sick, and Penny gets stuck taking care of him, rubbing Vaporub on his chest, and singing `Soft Kitty'.  In `The Bat Jar Conjecture', it's Sheldon's team versus the rest of the gang and Leslie Winkle (Sara Gilbert), in the Physics Bowl.  Sheldon's knockout of a twin sister arrives and makes waves, in `The Pork Chop Indeterminacy'.  Sheldon gets a look in the mirror, in `The Jerusalem Duality' when a young genius arrives on campus.  In `The Nerduana Annihilation', when Leonard buys the time machine used in the classic 60's film `The Time Machine' on eBay, Penny's  astute description is that `It looks like something that Elton John would drive through the Everglades'.  In the season finale, there's a glimmer of hope for romance for Leonard, in `The Tangerine Factor' when Penny agrees to go out with him.The Big Bang Theory is simply one of the most engaging comedies to come along in years.  Each episode seems to fly by, and leave you wanting more.  Some commentary tracks would have been cool, but the only bonus is the `Quantum Mechanics of The Big Bang Theory' a look at the creators, cast, and genesis of the show.  There are only seventeen episodes in the First Season due to the writers' strike.Things only get better in the second season, as the show's creative team continue to develop the characters, and introduce new elements to the mix, keeping things fresh and extremely funny.  As Sheldon Cooper might say, it is a foregone conclusion that the third season will be characterized by the same outstanding writing, and brilliantly quirky humor found in the first two seasons, continuing to keep The Big Bang Theory, at the cutting edge of contemporary comedy."
"When this show first came out, I paid only casual attention to it.  I wasn't hooked until I saw the episode in which Sheldon and Leslie Winkle (Leonard's girlfriend at the moment) engage in an argument over the relative merits of String Theory and Quantum Gravity.  I had been involved in a discussion with one of my fellow scientists regarding this very same topic only days before viewing this episode--and the points that we addressed were almost the same as those articulated by the characters.  I had never seen a TV show where the characters actually talked about the same things that we real scientists do--and actually in an intelligent manner!  That said, not all statements voiced by the characters regarding physics are sensible or realistic.Of course, this is a TV comedy--not a documentary!  Unlike Sheldon, Leonard, and the rest of the crew, Physicists and other Ph.D.-bearing scientists and engineers who reside in the real world have little interest in comic books and superheroes.  In fact, of the thousands of scientists who I have known, only one ever expressed a great interest in comic books or superheroes.  Although people with such graduate degrees have generally seen movies and TV shows featuring such staples as Star Trek, Star Wars, and Lord of the Rings, I am not sure that they view them more often than the general public.  Most scientists I know are more interested in the sports teams of their hometowns, music (both popular and classical), politics, and literature.  It is probably true, however, that scientists read more science fiction novels than the general public.Like Leonard, most scientists would indeed count themselves lucky to have a charming girlfriend like his lovely neighbor Penny played by Kaley Cuoco--and her often insightful character provides an important counterpoint to the book-smart but socially awkward scientists across the hall.  Her character is also admirable for her many clever and humorous remarks.  She is even able to eventually appreciate the somewhat obscure in-jokes of her scientist neighbors!  I should also observe that some scientists and engineers do have to ability to surround themselves with attractive women--and it is such smooth operators who become department heads at universities or government research labs!It has also come to my attention that this TV show was nearly the biggest topic of conversation for physicists attending the 2012 March Meeting of the American Physical Society!  Apparently many of the attendees had all of the episodes memorized, and spent much of their time at the APS meeting debating the significance and theme of each episode!"
"Sitcoms are coming back in full force! CBS is running the show with hits like Two and A Half Men and How I Met Your Mother. This year a new one was added to the bunch. The Big Bang Theory is the story of two supergenius roomates Sheldon and Leonard whose lives revolve around numbers, chemical equations and a lot of Science Fiction pop culture. Suddenly there world is turned upside down when the beautiful blonde Penny moves in next door. Now two worlds hystericaly clash as the boys learn how to live life and Penny learns to tolerate them.I was part of a focus group watching the pilot and I was laughing from begining to end. I think it may be hard for the average TV watcher to get some of the jokes and references, but I also feel to really appreciate this show you have have people like this in your life! My own younger brother is a former jock watches sports all the time and would never touch the subjets touched upon on this show. Still, he had me for an older brother so he gets a large portion of the references and therefore he thinks it's one of the best shows on TV. I have to admit I am somewhat classified in the geek category. I love Sci-fi/ fantasy movies, I'm an cartoon watcher, love working on computers and all that stuff. But I have a few of friends that are way over the top than I am. They go to cons, playing rpgs, dress up to movie premeres and know all the details that make this planet tick. So really you may not get this show unless you live it!!!"
"House is always the man with me. He can siolve any medical mystery, and smart as you know what. Like this show a lot..."
"At the end of season 3 we were given the shocking conclusion of losing the team we have loved for three years. Foreman quit because he didn't want to become House, Cameron quit because it was time for a change and Chase was fired. I know a lot of dedicated fans felt this was a big mistake, as these were characters that we had fallen in love with and didn't want to say goodbye to. Season 3 left us with a message that it was time for a change. Let me tell you that this change was awesome. Starting with episode 1 of season 4, House is alone in his office and hasn't worked since he lost his team. Determined to get House to hire new staff, Cuddy sets him a challenge. Cure his patient alone and he doesn't have to hire a team, otherwise if he can't figure out what's wrong on his own, he must hire a team. House loses the bet and episode one ends with House in a room of 40 doctors hoping to be on the team.Season 3, in a way was one of the more emotional seasons when testing his friendship with Wilson and testing his previous teams loyalty. Season 4 was more of a relief from that drama, with which some people may not like, but I truly loved. The first few episodes became a reality TV type show in which House would test his 40 possible employees and fire the ones that failed. Over this time we started to become aware of who the team would eventually be and what their quirks and personalities were.With the comic relief of the first few episodes, the finale presents us with a real tear jerker and possibly the most emotional episodes we have ever seen from the show. Wilson falls in love with one of House's former possible employees, but the finale tests their love as his girlfriend is taken critically ill. Robert Sean Leonard really shines in the finale and next to the sensible man we've come to know and love, he gives us a real emotional side. The two part finale is something brilliantly made that no fan will be disappointed with. I find that even with the writers strike, we were still given the most triumphant season finale from the entire show.Along with that I can't help but think that they had plans to have the old team re-unite at the end of season four. Unfortunately we wouldn't get to see that at the end of season four. I hope we really do get to see this situation arise in season five, although the team aren't completely gone. Cameron is in E.R., Chase is now a surgeon and Foreman is back and working for House already. In this season we were given a further development between the relationship of Cuddy and House. I'm hoping that in season 5 we are given a definitive answer on where this relationship is going. This season, as usual was filled with the classic lines that it's famous for and below are some of my favourites.From Episode 4: Guardian Angels:House: ""I can't ask the black guy or one of the chicks to do it; it'd be insensitive.""From Episode 10: It's A Wonderful Life:House: ""You talk to your kid about sex so she'll think you're open about everything. Keeps her from asking questions about the things you don't wanna talk about.""From Episode 13: No More Mr. Nice Guy:House: ""Run him for everything you can think of: lepto, schisto, hemo and the fourth Marx Brother nobody ever heard of. """
"I've loved HOUSE since its inception for the most obvious reason: Hugh Laurie. This season decided to sidestep a little and really take some time to highlight the supporting characters. The moments of the series that give me the most consistent pleasure are the moments with Laurie interacting with Robert Sean Leonard and Lisa Edelstein. Those scenes are attacked with gusto and a great deal of humor. The ""medical mysteries"" are slightly more edgy than your usual doctor drama, but don't really add to what makes the show great as often as they could. I will close this review by saying that the season finale is one of the most tragic episodes of television ever. I was sobbing like a little girl who skins her knee while finding out her puppy just ran away from home at the same time she found out that Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny don't exist. I found it very difficult to stop crying for several minutes AFTER the show was over!"
"To me, this series can be pretty darn good...I hope they keep it running and not saddle it with idiots and break it as they have done with so many decent tv series that get chopped and cut by studios and then rehashed into dung heap reruns...this series is a pretty good one which I can personally relate to as a medical professional.  Enjoy the show, it is pretty decent...This season was a bit weird not having the old staffers with House but they did some rather odd things and came out ok.  Some of the plot ideas I think could have used some rethinking but they did the student stuff ok overall.  I will be interested to see what happens with the old staffers in the next season."
"House is my favorite show, combining the drama, tension and intelligence of a amazing medical series with believability, quirkiness, oddities, subtle humor, endearing charm and wonderful casting."
"Funny, funny, funny, so very funny!I enjoyed seasons 1 & 2 of ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" on DVD, a friend at work was big on the show and constantly quoted lines from it and described the scenes to me. Long story short, he bought Sea. 1 + 2 and I borrowed it blindly, having never seen a episode. I liked it, it took a while and several episodes, but I liked it.Then came...Season 3, wow, easily the funniest single season of any show I have seen so far. I laughed and laughed at Charlie, Dee and the gang. I've always liked Danny DeVito, who doesn't, but his character (Frank) is really good and very funny! I also think the opening of the show is one of the best I've seen in awhile!Green Man is iconic and then there are, well, the McPoyles!My favorite episodes where:Sweet Dee's Dating a Retarded PersonThe Aluminum Monster and Fatty McGooThe Gang Dances Their Asses OffThe Gang Gets Taken HostageHilarious, looking forward to Sea. 4 on DVD soon~"
This is the greatest show on television today. I own every season now and watch at least one show every day. It never disappoints in making me laugh historically.
Awesome series! Will continue watching. The cast seem to be fused as one - of course some have relations outside this series so maybe that is why they act so well together. Looking forward to future seasons.
This is one of the best shows on TV right now. I love how improv it is and funny.
Season 3 is a bit better than 2. The story lines aren't as focused on the Danny Devito character (Frank Reynolds). Funny and very enjoyable.
I love &#34;Sunny.&#34; Frank is like the funniest father figure on the planet. I could never have a gloomy day watching these guys. This is a must have!
"Love this show!!! I think season three is when the show starts taking off and being more awesome! When Frank enters the mix, then the fun really begins. I used to hate this show, but now it's my favorite. I bought this used and works great. No complaints at all! Buy it if you like stuff that doesn't suck."
"Law and Order 16 Still Rocks! Unique ideas, excellent characters, top-notch acting. Law and Order 16 Still Rocks! Two thumbs up!"
This is a good series.  This is the granddaddy of all police series.  I recommend this series to anybody seeking good entertainment in this type of entertainment.
"This series shows imagination in the types of cases it comes up with.  I've seen lower ratings posted for the later episodes of the series, but I think the whole series was consistently good from beginning to end, personally. I think you should wait a little longer to ask for a rating of an entire season after its purchase, because no one is going to watch the entire season in 3 days."
"Prison break continues to be a great ""seat of the pants"" show...Prison Break Season 3 lives up to the first two seasons.  I highly recommend the entire series."
"i enjoy watching all the seasons of prison break,it is a very interesting shown,and its very different.the charactors in this show are extremly smart and different."
"To start, I'd like to mention that this season is only 13 episodes, due to the writers' strike. That being said, I actually think it's still on par with the previous two seasons. Some say it seemed a little rushed but I actually think it may have been a bit too much to have an entire 22 or 23 episode season of breaking out of a prison in Panama that only has guards on the outside. They do a great job once again of keeping you on the edge of your seat with this one.A lot more is revealed about ""The Company"" and the massive conspiracy, and of course, Burrows and Scofield find themselves neck deep in it. Some old faces and new alike with Scofield continuing to outsmart pretty much everyone makes this another satisfying and addictive season of Prison Break."
The 3rd season brings more thrills and adventures that leave you on the edge of your seat anticipating what will happen next
Another example of Michaels brain over brawnEven as individuals unravel they stay true to their charactersThe series isn't as believable in this season but it doesn't have to be as the emotional attachment to the characters has already been formedThey keep the series exciting with more implied violence than actual blood and gore which I think is more intelligent
"I passed this series up more than one time thinking it was just another reality show.  When I finally did give it a shot, I was hooked!  Having watched the first season on Netflix, I knew I had to buy the rest to find out what enterprising shenanigans Michael could come up with next.  I really really don't like the way the last season ended.  I think it was a rip off to &#34;set aside&#34; a very big part of this series in a two hour dvd that isn't part of the original seasons."
YOU FALL IN LOVE AND GET DEEPLY ENGROSSED WITH THE CHARACTERS AND YEARN FOR THEIR HAPPINESS AND SUCCESS. VERY ADDICTIVE. CAN'T STOP WATCHING THIS SHOW.
"I enjoyed this third season more than the previous seasons. I found the acting and storyline much superior than previously. I like all the twists throughout the episodes, keeping one at the edge of his seat. Outguessing the plot can be difficult.  This season is also action packed, with every episode offering non-stop action. The way all the characters come together is also fascinating and remarkable, and their motives are unknown. Even the temporary break between Michael and Lincoln over the death of ****** (removed as not to spoil the story) was unexpected.The inmates inside Sona, the Panamanian prison from where Michael Scofield must escape, were very believable.  His escape attempts were well conceived and believable as well. The Panamanian landscape offered an exotic touch to the storyline, different from the maximum-security prison at Fox River.I really recommend this season, and can't wait for season four."
i wish that nbc has never taken this show off of the air.  it is one of them shows that you have to see from season 1 and on to under stand the show.  the best.
"Excellent fantasy!  This has a continuing story line and the more you get to know the characters and their lives prior and after the events, you will be hooked.  I am only sorry that they were cancelled.  I did not like the ending."
A local station started reruns of Heroes.  I never watch the beginning of the series when it was on TV.  I got hooked on the reruns and decided I needed to watch it from the beginning.  I got Season one and decided I needed Season Two.  I now have 3 & 4.  I will get 5 & 6 at a later date.
This is the best season of a show that could have been great! Great start and the story was hot. The development of the players was well done. TAfter this season the show went downhill and became trash. A must buy for people who like super heroes and villians. This is the only season oof the show that you should watch or buy.
What if we all had powers but everyone's was different? would you use it for good or evil? Would you help others?
"I am on ep 9,  and the good hero's are still going strong and some good characters are ..leaving, but being replaced with more great characters and twist.  I am enjoying second season as much as I have enjoyed the first season so far. and hope the rest of the season's are as good.  Kristen bell is in this season, and the guy from the past (Japan 1871) appears to be a great addition.  I love to watch some of the old characters learning more about their past / families, and some characters are not sure what side they are on any more.  Who is the good team, and who is the bad team.  Everyone seems to have their idea on how a hero can save the future.  Someone learns that they have more powers than they thought they had, and are becoming more like their parent with the new found powers.  Think I am addicted.  :("
"after season one i couldn't wait to get more of these guys. what a thrill ride, perfect way to unwind"
"The second season was pretty good. More background on the main characters and the conspiracy, more creepy moments and some good writing in the episodes."
love being able to watch all these episodes. watching them anytime that I want to. really love watching this show
"I just love the series Heroes and have all of their seasons, it a great TV Show which I highly recommendpeople to see it! But to Understand it, you will have to start out watching the Seasons in order i.e. do notwatch season 2 without watching season 1 First, or you will have problems figuring out who's the good guysand who's the bad guys!"
First couple of seasons were great liked the action stories the most.  I had missed a few episodes so was good to wsatch view them.
"I thought this was a great show and can't wait to watch the rest of the series, They keep you interested thru the whole show and keep coming back to see what happens next'"
"This unassuming little show about a small Texas town and it's football team was a great ride, all the way through to the final season.  The show features well-rounded characters with realistic problems and believable flaws.  And, that's refreshing, compared to some of today's reality shows (where the filthy rich drum up pseudo-problems to complain about).Maybe the fictional town of Dillon, Texas reminded me nostalgically of my own hometown, where the whole town populace came out on Friday nights to cheer on the football team of the only high school in town.  Or maybe the fictional characters just remind me of my own classmates, teachers, and coaches.  But, whatever the reason, this is one great show, well-acted and under-recognized."
"This is what television should be all about. Refreshing series about life, family, responsibility and football! I love it and can't stop watching it."
Love the show no violence just a real life show with kids playing foitball and a coach  with his family
"Really loved this show, was so sad to see it end, it was a great one for the whole family to watch together"
I'm obsessed with this show. I can't get enough. I watch it until my Kindle runs out of battery and stand watching while it is charging. My hubby just laughs
"The best complient an actor can get is that his or her character is memorable, and you care about them. The best compliment a writer can get is that the stories are beleivable and unpredictable. This show is compliment rich. I'm not a fan of the big hair, y'all crowd but these are real people in real situations that are not overly dramatized. Each season does get better and as you know some characters are leaving the show, their exits are done realistically and without detachment. We started watching out of boredom and are now hooked. A great series!"
"Although through the first few episodes FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS remained one of the most compelling shows on TV, it had suffered a bit from some structural problems in its narrative.  On the one hand, Coach Taylor was off at Texas Methodist University, making his ongoing involvement in the narrative a challenge.  On the other hand, there was the unnecessarily melodramatic killing by Landry of Tyra Collette's Season One stalker/attempted rapist.  The latter has been a problem because what made Season One so outstanding was how it felt like an encapsulation of real lives.  The killing simply didn't feel real.In my opinion the show always managed to overcome these missteps to remain a fascinating and engrossing show.  But it did generate the sense that the season in some ways hadn't really begun.  In this episode, however, Coach Taylor is back in Dillon, back in his old job, and returned to his family.  And his return already seems to have helped several individuals.  His wife Tami already seems less stressed.  His daughter, who had been sorely tempted by the older bad boy known as The Swede, seems to have recovered her relationship with her mother, who gave her advice that may have helped Julie realize just how lame The Swede truly was.  And he seems to have helped Buddy Garrity just as much.  In the first three episodes Buddy seemed unsure of himself, rattled by the loss of his family as well as his status within the booster club.  Here he is as confident as ever.The delicious part about this episode, as with the series as a whole, was the sheer number of things that took place in it.  The show in many ways breaks with much traditional TV writing.  A typical episode will have an A plot and a B plot, though after HILL STREET BLUES in the early eighties, many shows would have multiple threads in an episode.  But some episodes of FNL have 7 or 8 or 9 threads going at once.  Yet, it doesn't come across as at all incoherent or muddled.  I'd love to see how they organize their various arcs.  I assume they have some sort of ongoing storyboard.After being a major part of the first three episodes, the Tyra-Landry romance/murder ordeal played a somewhat smaller role in terms of time.  Tyra does come to Landry's house for dinner, a nice touch.  Though she has been increasingly attached to Landry, she has been somewhat unwilling to make their relationship obvious in public, let alone to her or his family.  So this represents a big step, especially combined with her explanation in the previous episode to Landry's father why she likes Landry (a great scene because it was almost as if verbalizing to someone THAT and WHY she liked Landry caused her to realize just how much she had come to feel for him).  While at dinner, however, Landry and Tyra overhear what they had been anticipating:  the discovery of her assailant's body.  I have no inside knowledge of what is going to happen on the show, but I think it is pretty clear that Landry is going to confess to what he did.So, despite a couple of things that seems atypical for this remarkable show, FNL seems entirely back on track.  These remain a collection of many of the best characters on television and the acting in this show can stand comparison with any other show.  I'm still not too excited about it being scheduled on Friday, but it remains, along with PUSHING DAISIES (easily the best new show of the season) the one show I most look forward to each week."
"This is one of the best series I've watched in a loooong time.  The characters are loveable, unforgettable and endearing.  I recommend this to all my TV-watching friends."
I still can't beleive how much I'm going to miss this watching Friday Night Lights......:( 5 seasons was just not enough!
"All seasons were fabulous!  Great casting, great characters, and good lines.  However, the kids look like they should be out of college, not still in high school.  This is closer to real life stories than most!"
"I wasn't much of an Office fan until somewhat recently, and I'm not quite sure why that is, but now I can't seem to get enough of it as I rewatch the seasons I currently own. I've now seen all of the episodes through season six, the second-to-last year of Michael Scott, and season four may very well be the best one, but it's a tough call because 3 and 5 are pretty darn good too.A few highlights include: Ryan is now at corporate, a funny and strange new variable; Andy starts dating Angela, with Dwight not entirely out of the picture; the Scanton branch creates a local advertisement; and Holly makes her debut in the finale, with Jan returning to get in the way of things.I of course recommend this to any fan of the Office. With that in mind; however, I would advise either purchasing or at least watching the previous season in its entirety first, for continuity purposes. Although some episodes in this season are better than others, I think every one of them are good and quite re-watchable. Either way, sit back and enjoy the hilarity that will ensue."
"I know everyone is whining around about the price for a shortened season, but let's face the facts, Season 4 was excellent even against tough expectations.  The humor was still buoyant and creative, and the storylines still had energy as the twists and turns stayed fresh.  Storylines were also craftily constructed to show parallels between characters, or wrapped together 2 or 3 seperate storylines, etc.After the slighest of let-downs in Season 3, Season 4 still shows the punch and zip of a fun and humorous mockumentary that's well edited."
"I LOVE The Office, and Season 4 caps off the best 3 seasons of The Office Created. Seasons 2, 3, and 4 are absolute magic. Every episode is amazing and full of hilarious Michael Scott moments, and spectacular character depth. You will find yourself emotionally attached to the characters while still laughing out loud several times an episode. Truly brilliant television."
"Amazon Unbox rocks!! Do not listen to a bunch of mad mac fans. Mac sucks and that is why nothing supports it. The Unbox service is easy to use, easy to download, and you get your episodes a day after they air! I am very happy with it. If a mac user is waiting for it to go to iTunes, forget it! Mac messed up again and thought their service was going to be the only one on the block. Now I can buy .mp3 songs (unprotected) and video files with being stuck with crapmac software. By the way if you buy a song on itunes it is in .mp4 format and can ONLY be used with crapmac software. So who is Propriety? Unbox 5 stars itunes 0 stars period!"
"Though the third season of ""The Office"" was, for the most part, still hilarious television at its finest, it sort of diverged from what made the show so endearing...the relationships.  While I commended the writers for doing such a thing to bring new life into the show, I also have to say that Season Four was a welcome return to what The Office does best.Despite being cut to just 14 episodes do to the TV Writer's strike of 2007-2008, this season manages to still provide a laugh a minute while also getting back to the core of the series, that being the relationships such as Jim/Pam and Dwight/Angela.  Michael Scott keeps doing his hilarious thing, but what sets The Office apart from all other comedy sitcoms is its ability to keep developing the characters and maintaining its quality level (e.g. not turning into a soap opera).  This season did not provide a drop off in that category as Jim & Pam ""shippers"" will be delighted at the return of that complicated romance, as well as the tension that always exists between Dwight and Angela.Thus, despite its shortened stature, I considered Season Four to be better (quality-wise) than the one preceding it.  Watch with confidence knowing that the writers/creators/producers are still able to keep things fresh and hilarious."
"I stumbled on ""30 Rock"" quite by accident one Thursday night when there was nothing much to watch.  I don't know why I wasn't attracted to it when it first came out ... but I can only guess some sort of other distraction.""30 Rock"" has grown to become my FAVORITE comedy series of all time.  I don't say that lightly either.  I love Tina Fey and with her Sarah Palin imitations she gained new notoriety and I think more and more people began to give ""30 Rock"" a try.One try (the 3rd season) and I was ABSOLUTELY hooked.  I received seasons 1 and 2 for Christmas and have just eaten them up over and over.  Any time I need to pull myself out of the dumps, I put on some ""30 Rock"" and enjoy several episodes at a time.  I love Kenneth and Tracey ... aww heck, I love them all.I am a late bloomer for this show but a definite junkie.,  I, too, am startled to discover how many people really don't know the show or have not watched it?? Like me I guess.  One or two episodes and you are hooked.It's the best.  :)"
"Season 1 of ""30 Rock"" was a landmark of television, if you ask me. Finally a sitcom that was original, refreshing, and, most of all, hilarious. When Season 2 began, my expectations were high. To say that my expectations were surpassed would be an understatement of grand proportions.Whereas the plotlines and randomly vanishing characters (any one of Rachel Dratch's appearances???) in Season 1 were out of left-field in that funny-but-almost-too-random kind of way, Season 2 was a different kind of animal.""30 Rock"" season 2 came from left-field, but this time, it pulled you over there with it. In the beginning, it held onto some of the pitfalls of Season 1 (i.e., Where was Jenna half the time???), but as episodes aired, the ensemble and the writing both grew into something much greater and more entertaining than Season 1 ever reached.Even as many shows suffocated and failed the hiatus the writer's strike brought, ""30 Rock"" seemed immune. In fact, I would be so bold as to suggest the break fueled the creativity. Either those last handful of episodes were pure, unadulterated brilliance, or I was just desperate for more ""30 Rock"" after their lengthy sabbatical.Some brilliant moments in Season 2: Carrie Fisher as a crazy ex-writer, EVERYTHING involving the Devon (Will Arnett) vs. Jack rivalry (including the Don Geiss coma), Jack's job at Homeland Security (can you say, ""gay bomb""?), & Kenneth's House Party AND a special appearance by Al Gore satiring himself (""A whale is in trouble!"") in one episode? Oh HECK yeah.All in all, ""30 Rock""'s sophomore season was a brilliant display that proved that comedy can be even better the second time around."
"Run to the bank, LizLemon! 30Rock busts out for season two sharper than ever! Spot on with it's cameos, Seinfeld-esque moments and knockout characters and writing, it deserves every one of its accolades. Bottle of wine and and one ""Play All"" menu selection, I found myself laughing out loud more than once with each episode.Don't miss the special features of the ""live on stage"" episode, raising money for the PAs during the infamous strike. It's spontaneous and fun to hear the audience laugh along. Bravo! If I had the patience to watch network TV, this would be on my list (but I don't)!"
"Minor spoilers!After a rough off-season for Alec Baldwin -- complete with rumors that he wanted to leave 30 ROCK and a parenting controversy that kept him in the tabloids for a spell -- and a surprisingly disappointing season premiere, both Baldwin and the show can be said to be completely back on track.  As the Amazon description reports, the A plot focuses on Jack's effort to outposition Devon Banks (marvelously portrayed by Will Arnett in a reprise of his Season One guest appearance) to become Don Geiss's replacement at GE, the parent company to NBC Universal.  The struggle is quite funny.  Devon, who is a lightly closeted gay, has ""turned straight"" and is courting Geiss's daughter.  He is also using the fact of Jack's heart attack, which he has attempted to keep quiet, to lessen his position within the corporation.  In response, Jack merely recruits a young, very handsome dude who tempts Devon beyond his powers to resist.  All in all, it is gamesmanship on a very funny level.The B plot is quite as good.  Jenna is still very overweight from all her pizza consumption during her involvement in a stage version of MYSTIC PIZZA during the summer break.  The writers attempt to take advantage of her weight gain by having her character shout ""Me want food!"" onstage, which Jenna adamantly refuses to do.  But when a skit falls apart onstage, she panicks and ad libs the line she said she wouldn't say.  Surprisingly, she is delighted when the line becomes a national catch phrase.  Suddenly, the extra weight gain, previously a liability, is now her good fortune.  Unfortunately, she now has to keep her weight up.The first episode of the season had been a serious disappointment, mainly because they stopped doing what they do well in order to restructure the episode around Jerry Seinfeld.  But this episode shows the series completely back on track.  It ramains one of the two or three funniest shows on TV."
"However, with the denouement or unraveling of the characters and their prospective lives, some of the episodes in this season have become a little far-fetched and tiresome. Nevertheless, viewed in their entirety, I continue to rate them as a well written and entertaining series of stories."
"The dudes are getting a bit more sensitive that I want them.  But hey stuff changes and it is still a lot of fun with math which I never saw coming.  Plus we get some super yummy guest spots with Lou diamond Phillips.  The guest stars are a lot of fun, you never know who is going to show up and I like that.  it is still an exciting show with a good mix of gun fire and family.  so sit down with your family and watch this."
"I like how they solve crimes and have a personal theme as well. Its just not only about the eppes brothers its about the team,family."
"I really enjoyed this season, the bond between the Epps brothers is a great side story. I suggest this series to everyone!"
"A lot of action, as well as introducing the math and science into solving crimes. Like the development of the characters, all in all a very enjoyable program."
"This season was even better than the last one, the stories are always interesting and I love all of the characters especially, Larry. He is so cute and so interestingly played\"
"The series came and I had a marathon Saturday watching, great stuff.  Sorry to see that it ended when it did."
I enjoy this series. The acting is fine. The plots areentertaining. I like the relationship between the father and his son's. And the way the son's work together.
"Great Show, especially if you love math, common sense and reasoning! Very Educational but also lots of action. Fast paced action! Characters are endearing. I have watched all 4 seasons!"
I love the acting in all these series. The stories are exciting and the plots are good. They are family friendly and there is no vulgarity; which is rare these days! You will enjoy NUMBERS!
You will enjoy this show if you like police and(or)math stories.This show combines a math teacher working with the FBI to solve crimes.
Numb3rs is a great television show due to its excellent writing and perfect casting. Rob Morrow has been lucky enough to get his second hit series. Who knew that math could be so fascinating!!!
Watching Colby having to get back with the team and learning more about everyone's backgrounds are some great plus' in this season. Also great to see Charlie and Amita getting closer
These are great.  We have now watched seasons 1 through 10 and are now anxiously awaiting the 11th  season. We love NCIS.
Loved Season 5 - every episode with great acting and the characters' story lines interwoven.  Some great writing and awesome cast.
My family really enjoyed watching NCIS the Complete Fifth Season! There aren't many shows left that we can watch as a family but this is one of them! Thanks for a great sale!
"Love, Love, Love!!!! It's NCIS...Enough Said :-) I love this show and have so enjoyed having the DVD's to watch anytime I want. Looking forward to purchasing season's 7, 8 and 9 (when available) soon."
I really like all of the NCIS episodes and enjoy the interactions of the cast. I've purchased all of the series up to and including season 10. In April when 11 is over i will purchase those as well. My wife is currently watching all of the seasons and is having a good time and laughing a lot.
"Is what the producers named this season as it answers the questions from season four.However, this season creates new questions for season 6.The result is a shorter season, 18 episodes instead of the standard 24, which is an almost perfect bridge between seasons four and six.The main story line is Director Shepard's pursuit of an arms dealer code name La Grenouille.This is complicated by her personal considerations and a possible link between La Grenouille and the CIA.Several excellent stories looking at our military trying to deal with multiple wars and cultures support this main story.All of this results in an entertaining season of excellent mysteries, great characters with a solid on-going story.While this is a season of answers their are new questions for next year."
"NCIS Episode: &#34;Chimera&#34; is one of my all time favorite NCIS episodes, Ziva is at her best here with her and Tony arguing all the time, I can watch this one over and over! (And I do). Oh almost forgot, I still have not gotten over Cote de Pablo leaving its just not the same without her!"
"This is one of very few current TV shows which is worth my time to watch. Most of the shows on TV now are vulgar, violent, unfunny, or intent on pushing an offensive social or sexual agenda - even the so-called animated comedies. Even the game shows are leaning way Left. Most Reality shows are just plane stupid and fall into the above description as well. Though NCIS is often more GP than G rated, it has great characters and good plots."
"If you know this show then order the DVDs. No problem with the DVDs, came fast and as stated. I ordered all seasons and love them all."
Great series and I would recommend to anyone over 18 years the storylines and interesting and keep you on the edge of your seat.
The product was in excellent condition and I got it very quickly. I'm very happy with my purchase.
I would buy this in a new york min.as always well acted plot was on the edge and left you wanting more
"I just finished this series and now am going into season 9.  I titled this season SOME LAUGHS; SOME TEARS because there is some added Castle type humor, some really weird episodes and then some really teary episodes.  I don't want to spill the proverbialbeans so I won't be specific but there is some changes here in the cast; one in particular who I have become very fond of.  Also asignificant death of one of the CSI persons. I was not particularly fond of this person, but he/she did not deserve what happened tothem.  Grissom finally falls for someone but after a serious murder attempt on her life, the relationship falters a bit.  There is a veryvile murderer who makes miniature models of the crime scenes even before the killings happen.  And the models are incrediblyaccurate.  I still haven't made up my mind if I like Cate Willows; sometimes she seems like she really hates men. sometimes not.But she appears arrogant in much of what she does.  And doesn't anyone in L.V. stay married?  While I love the show, I don't thinkI want to visit there; Detroit has safer streets!!  There seems to be whores all over the place; not my favorite type of women.And there is the crossdressing Carp.  The quality of the productions continue to be outstanding;  a superb cast and terrific musicalaccompanying backdrops.  Good background and theme music is extremely important to me in TV and motion pictures.  Some ofthe murders are so gruesomely realistic I almost have to turn away....almost anyhow!  I have 13 seasons to date, but won't getthe 14th until the price comes down a bit.  Still,I get them all from Amazon.  And of all the shows I watch, only two bad castingsthat I judge:  Jar Jar Binn & Dr. Sweets, although I suppose we could include Martha from CASTLE.  I believe that this wonderfulCSI series is the best crime series on the telly; I am including ALL CSI series of course. Enjoy!!"
Great show and gets better as it goes.  Arrived quickly and in great shape.  Must watch from the beginning. Amazing!
"My favourite show never fails to deliver the goods. This is a fantastic season, despite the depature of Jorja Fox (Sara). Surprisingly, there was hardly any fanfare when she left (not on screen anyway). Her relationship with Grisolm was only beginning to take off for the viewers and before it could really get off the ground, she was gone.In the first episode, Dead Doll, the team race against the clock to find Sara who has been left for dead in the heat of the desert. That was one of the best episodes. My next favourite episode was A La Carte where they investigate a beheaded teen from a go-cart accident. Then in Cockroaches and Lying Down With Dogs, we start to see Warrick in a whole different light - drugs and alcohol and he's framed for a murder in these two episodes. The final show for this season is called For Gedda in which Warrick is accused of murdering a famous Vegas gangster and even he is uncertain of his guilt or innocence. What happens at the end of this episode will leave every fan in shock (even though you've probably read about it or seen it already). I was devastated.This season gives us a real good look into more of the characters personal lives. The story lines always remain fresh and there seems to be no shortage of material and ideas for keeping us fans loyal. It remains my absolute favourite show and as usual, I cannot wait for it's release. I only hope that for a change, they'll put a synopsis on the dvd cover of each episode. Sometimes you go to look for a particular episode and don't know the name of it - only the storyline - which makes searching for it a little tricky, but despite this, it's always a good buy and I thoroughly enjoy re-watching these all. I hope you'll enjoy it too."
"Warning: slight spoilers ahead.You'd figure that for a show going on it's eighth season (a season shortened by the WGA strike to boot) that things would get a bit stale to say the least, especially considering the horde of network TV imitators to pop up since it's original inception.  Fear not, C.S.I. still manages to keep going strong, and it picks up by grabbing the viewer by the throat and not letting go either.  Grissom (William L. Petersen) and his team race against time to find and save Sara (Jorja Fox) as her life hangs in the balance, which eventually leads up to her departure from Vegas, as well as a heartbroken Grissom.  Things don't get much better for the crew as Catherine (Marg Helgenberger) receives a threat, and Warrick's (Gary Dourdan) life begins to spin out of control, leading him to be charged for murder, and concludes in the explosive season finale which only promises more changes to come.  While some moments may come off as a bit hackneyed, C.S.I. manages to still be spectacular thanks to the depth that the principal characters get in this eighth season.  Even lab-man Hodges (Wallace Langham) gets an episode to shine as he and the lab techs play some ""murder games"" in the inventive episode ""You Kill Me"".  There's also a crossover with Without a Trace, as Grissom and FBI Agent Jack Malone (Anthony LaPaglia) team up to solve a murder and kidnapping.  All in all, C.S.I. still manages to wonderfully deliver the goods even in it's eighth season, and still remains the best prime time, network TV crime drama on the air today."
"want to know why amazon doesn't have several seasons - it's annoying to go through 1 to 5, skip 6 to 10 and then juimp back to season 15 - get with it amazon! Those of us who love this series want to watch it in order"
I love this show. China was'nt one of my favorite seasons but it was good all the same. I bought it well worth ten bucks.
I love Survivor and Season 15 is definitely in my top 5 or 6. I highly recommend watching. There are a few really fun characters.
"Great great great! I love all these older seasons of Survivor. I especially liked this season because unlike most seasons, they are not on a beach on an island. A little change of scenery was appreciated."
"by herself is worth watching this season of Survivor. She doesn't win, unfortunately, but what a game she plays. She's both smart and beautiful."
Speedy deliver. DVD received as advertised. Opened the package; put in the DVD; just push play... It another terrific season of HIMYM
This show is just freakin' hilarious! The interaction and relationship between all the characters will make you laugh out loud!
"If you are a fan of How I Met Your Mother this is the D.V.D. for you.Out of the three seasons this one is the best.  During this season things change for the gang.1. Lilly and Marshall get married2. Robin and Ted break up3. Ted meets Stella and starts a relationship with her4. Find out about Robin's teen years in Canada as ""Robin Sparkles""5. ""Slapsgiving""and many more adventures that make this DVD legend, wait for it (hope your not lactose intolerant) dary"
"Sorry to see it end.  Great stories and great acting.  The Good guys win, but at great personal cost, not only to the soldiers, but their families as well.."
"This series gives one a genuinely good sense of pride, our troops work hard to defend us the American people.. This show is well written, the actors talented. Delightfully entertaining."
I enjoy the unit.  Great looking guys that are not afraid to get dirty.  The loyalty is very refreshing especially now days. What is not to like?
"Beautiful and talented women...GORGEOUS and sexy men.....mysterious Black Ops,  well it doesn't get any better than this!  If you ask for a review on these guys it is always going to be five stars if it comes from me!"
I don't know why this was cancelled prematurely but I really liked this show and wish there were many more seasons to watch.
"We found these stories exciting, interesting and have tried to see additional episodes but for reasons we could not bring them in.  The screen message said to retry an/or cancel.  We tried everything but we still could not access."
What a great series this was.  need to get more series like this one.  I wish it was still on television.
"This is by far the bst series of its type I have ever seen.  The characters are solid, you either love or hate them,  The actors are all superb in their roles.If this series has not won a bunch of awards then something is wrong."
"While it was only about half of a normal season (I assume due to the writer's strike), it was still filled with many different and varied situations along with some enduring story and character development themes.  I highly recommend watching the whole series (all 4 seasons).  I'm glad I watched them through all at once instead of waiting a week for each episode."
"I love the intensity and controlled chaos this show delivers. The show is deep with the units assignments but also with the inner turmoil that each unit member goes through battling decisions of morality and ethics. The wives are in a similar dilemma facing their worst fears of losing their loved one, yet kept in the dark about what the husbands do and unable to speak about their husbands without endangering their lives, careers, and support from the Army who doesn't recognize the Unit in any official capacity. Great series!"
"The first part of Season 2 got a bit repetitive and then the train suddenly picked up speed and left the station and it has continued to charge ahead all through season 3.  Great writing, characters and inter-character bonding."
I watched the show The Unit when it was television and then bought my husband the first two seasons on DVD.  I didn't know that it had continued until I watched it on Amazon Fire streaming video.  I liked it so much that my husband and I went back to the beginning of the series after we watched seasons 3 and 4.  Watch it and find out for yourself how good it is.
I love this show I thought the beginning of season three was the best of the series. They definitely took a different approach for this season then season 2 but it works and is a fun show to watch. I always get a kick out of how many foreign countries look like a washed out version of California. :)
This series keeps you pumped up! It's like you're there with them on their missions. Love this series! Keep it coming!
"Best military series on TV, someone missed the boat when they cancelled this one"
I love this series!  Stories are interesting and are concluded with each episode and not carried over to next time. I love Dennis Haysbert as Jonas. His voice is incledible and what a tall man. Sorry it is no longer being made.
I love all the seasons of The Unit. Wish it was still on television. I enjoyed my binge watch of this show. One exciting episode after another.
"I'm hooked on the Unit, each Season has been fantastic!  Each episode has its own great story line and VERY action packed.  I love the characters, the story line of both the mission and the home front.  I was truly involved in this season and each episode!"
The whole series was great. It showed how military teams work together and have each others back.  It also showed how the wives help and support  each other. I would recommend this series to anyone.
"We love this show!  The acting is incredible and the storyline is very believable.  There are characters you love to hate (like Tiffy) and then there are characters you adore, and others who surprise you in varying episodes.  Scott Foley is so good - you never know what to think about him - whether he's sometimes careless or otherwise brilliant and shows his &#34;human&#34; side.  He is also very good at dropping in bouts of humor when they are very much needed.  I highly recommend this show!"
"I can't understand why this show was canceled. It had everything: adventure, action, tension on the front and tension at home, great cast. If you missed this on TV watch it here. Best show."
"Every episode is exciting and thrilling. I do not understand why CBS decided to stop producing the show after the fourth season. Just like 24, they should reconsider their decision."
"After what I felt was a lackluster second season, this short season's returns to the action that made the first season amazing.  The stakes are a little high in some of the episodes (I wont spoil things, but I'm sometimes amazed that they dont mobilize The Army instead of The Unit when faced with the trials and tribulations they do), but the interaction with the wives and families is a lot more complementary than a separate drama.The only thing missing?  The theme from seasons 1 and 2!  I like the new song by Robert Duncan, but I thought the ""Fired Up"" cadence from the first two seasons was a rare case of a flawless theme song.  But I'll forgive it."
"Military missions, duplicity, spy-craft...  Great show, well written.  I love the pacing, the problem solving and the never quit spirit of these characters.  They use their brawn and their smarts for good and none of them are bad to look at.Overall a very intelligent, action packed show and I wish there were more of it."
"We just love this series. It's full of so much action, drama, is funny, love and affection, deceit, and the loyalty between the men in the unit is awesome. We can't wait to watch the next episode."
"Another great season, season 3 follows season 2 as my favorite of the series! The writers do an amazing job and the actors do an excellent job as their characters! A must see!"
Like the series and the actors. Please see our other reviews of Bones. Range of personalities and dynamics are good.
"I had gotten season 1 & debated about getting any other seasons. The show was very well done but the character of Bones was very irritating as she was clueless to everyday life, & only spoke & related to things in scientific terms. (I realize this was the ""joke"" of the show but it was really annoying to me.)  Friends told me that it got better as the seasons progressed.I got season 3 BEFORE getting season 2, as I didn't think it would make much of a difference (& it was cheaper at the time too). My friends were right, Bones isn't anywhere near as annoying as she was in season 1, she's more normal.  The only thing with jumping from season 1 to season 3, apparently I missed a LOT in season 2. There are (now) new characters (Booth apparently has a history with one of them) & there are many new story lines. Season 3, I find out Bones' father (played by Ryan O'Neal) was arrested in season 2 by Booth. There are other story lines I need to get caught up on as well from season 2.The show is very well done, although the corpses are rather gross & disgusting - and sometimes they are way too graphic. There are several extras on this DVD & there ARE subtitles for the hearing impaired.  Also, this DVD set has a ""bonus"" of the first 4 episodes from season 4.  I have ordered season 2 (so I can see what I missed). Season 3 is MUCH BETTER than season 1."
"After I discovered Bones, I had to have all seasons. I love the show. Good chemistry, the writing is great."
"**Plot SPOILERS alert**BONES keeps on keeping on. Two excellent seasons under its belt, and a truncated Season 3 (damn you, writers' strike!) finally all wrapped up, and predictably, these are good episodes, as well. But only fifteen of them! As Season 3's first episode (""The Widow's Son in the Windshield"") opens up, we learn that Bones has been reluctant to go in the field with Booth and she won't say why. However, a head flung off a bridge forces her to reconnect with Booth. This episode also begins a new serial killer arc, this one being particularly even more gristly and diabolical than most, and of which resolution later down the season would have tragic consequences.Season 3 doles out several other subplots. As per the startling news learned at the altar from Season 2's finale, Angela is already married. An ongoing story arc becomes Hodgins and Angela's search for her long-time but vaguely remembered husband. ""The Secret of the Soil"" introduces Dr. Sweets, a 22 year old psychotherapist assigned to counsel Bones and Booth, this stemming from the FBI's concern due to Booth having arrested Bones' father. These sessions are generally funny stuff as, mostly, Booth can't help but treat Sweets like a kid. Plus, these scenes tend to open things up even more between Bones and Booth.I've a couple of Season 3 favorites. ""The Widow's Son in the Windshield"" introduces the cannibalistic Gormogon killer, which would become a key ongoing story arc of the season. ""Mummy in the Maze"" is a very neat Halloween show, wherein Booth's shameful phobia is unveiled and Bones's costume is...simply awesome. ""The Knight on the Grid"" is a taut thriller as the Gormagon killer returns, this time with a personal vendetta against Bones and Booth. And ""The Santa in the Slush"" is a standout sentimental episode and provides one of the best moments in the series as Bones cuts a deal to have Christmas brought to her incarcerated father and brother. Cool ending, too. ""The Baby in the Bough"" has Bones forced to babysit an infant involved with a case (you see the potential, right?). Meanwhile, ""The Wannabe in the Weeds"" (in which Zach and Bones both sing) and ""The Pain in the Heart"" are striking for their ability to stun the audience, even if the latter episode definitely had a rushed feeling to it. I feel that the after-effects of ""The Wannabe in the Weeds"" should've been developed further in ""The Pain in the Heart."" In fact, ""The Pain in the Heart"" - which wraps up the Gormogon killer storyline and, by the way, will upset busloads of fans - could've really, really benefited by being a two-episode arc.The cases are still bizarre and the corpses borderline grotesque. But the draw remains Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz, and that electric ""thing"" between them. These two still get aces in chemistry, and are still the smokingest hot couple on television. Emily Deschanel continues to nail her role of Temperance ""Bones"" Brennan. And while her character might've loosened up a little bit (not too much), there's still that endearing naivette and vulnerability which peek out occasionally. And, of course, her refreshing bluntness (some call it social awkwardness) has never left. Boreanaz, he's just a great leading man. Confident and charming, bristling with machismo, yet with a sensitive side. His unveiling of his Christmas present to Bones in ""The Santa in the Slush"" is one of the best, most touching scenes of the season.Tack on the rest of the offbeat but familiar crew from the Jeffersonian Institution, and these folks continue to provide the best show in forensics crime-solving. All the ingredients to the series' success are on display for Season 3 - the boosts of levity, the whiffs of romance, the chilling mysteries, and the ongoing character developments. BONES just keeps on keeping on."
"This third season was shorter than the previous ones, but it was particularly hefty in events and closures. And it is these closures that have to be examined.The first one is the integration of the psychiatrist and profiler Dr. Lance Sweets. He officially comes to help Dr Brennan and Special Agent Booth deal with the stress in their relationship due to the extreme tension their work is bringing in and imposing onto them. He is some kind of relation counselor. At first they took it badly but little by little they accepted to consult him and to follow his advice. That brings some clarification in the warped relationship that develops between the two people concerned. Little by little too he is integrated as a profiler in some of their cases and even later in all of them. This is a new development for the series.The second closure is really a closure. It concerns Temperance's father and by ricochet her brother. He is finally brought to court for his killing of the FBI deputy head. Dr Brennan is not even called as a witness whereas all her laboratory friends and Special Agent Booth are. She stands with the defense and she holds her position well. The tactics of the defense is simple. Let the prosecution put down all their cards and then let's deal with the jury's most intimate conviction. In other words let's give the jury some alternative hypotheses as who could have done the killing. Here Dr Brennan plays an essential role to save her father and set him free. Can such a flawless scientist accept to be doubted and even negatively represented even if it is to save her father's freedom?The third closure is Zack. He had been sent to Iraq at the beginning of the season but his absence had not held one full episode. He was brought back to Washington DC because of his disruptive role in a military team due to his inability to integrate. But his attitude and role is becoming overbearing with everyone. Some would say that he must be slightly autistic and that would be a mistake. He is a very fragile personality who compensates his weakness in character with over-competence in his scientific field. He is irreplaceable. Yet he can become the prey of any strong personality he would encounter. His enhanced scientific competence is over-normal but it is a way to hide his brittleness. This season will bring Zack to his doom but you will have to be discovered it by yourself.The fourth closure is also contained in this season. It starts at the beginning of it and ends with its final episode. It is the story of a serial killer that appears in some episodes. This serial killer is obviously imitated from Dexter and his viciousness is even worse than anything you may examine. Of course he tries to penetrate and infiltrate the Jeffersonian Institute and he will succeed for a time, though his agent will not be the best he could have found. He is a cannibal, the heir and continuator of an old practice against secret societies. We can hear there an echo to some of Dan Brown's cogitation about old secret societies and free masons. That serial killer will be destroyed and will finally exit the series under a nickname, Gormogon. He is nameless.This last element is surprising in such a series because the series is hyper scientific and tries to reject and even rebut all superstitions, mythologies, beliefs and even religions. Dr Brennan should know that the unnamable, the one who does not have a name, the one whose name is unutterable us also the one who was, the one who is and the one who will come. To keep a criminal nameless is to deify or at least magnify that criminal just as if he were some kind of divinity.That's the last remark I will make on this third season. It deals with social cases more often than criminal cases, and the crimes in each case are the result of weak people who cannot cope with the stress of life. Gormogon is the exception. In one word the series gets better as for its thrilling, even frightening atmosphere and it analyses in fair and fine details the relations between the various members of the team, of the laboratory, of the people who have dedicated their lives to fighting against crime.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID"
"Haven't watched all the episodes on this set yet, but they are as good the second time around as the first."
"Once more DVD comes to the rescue of a TV series that has turned from so so ratings to solid hit. The series is BONES and there is no better way to watch this than on DVD. Why? Because once you get into the series you'll want to continue on rather than wait for the next episode.Just released is BONES SEASON THREE: TOTALLY DECOMPOSED EDITION. How can it be that this show has been on that long already? For those unfamiliar with the show its time to catch up.Based on the real life of forensic anthropologist Kathy Reichs, the story revolves around Dr. Temperance Brennan (Emily Deschanel), a forensic specialist who works at the Jeffersonian in Washington, D.C. When the FBI comes calling for assistance in the form of Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz), Temperance takes to field work like a pro with an intense interest in each case presented.Along with Temperance, known as Bones to Booth, are a team of equally dedicated professionals at the Institute. Among them are Angela (Michaela Conlin) who specializes in facial and body reconstruction via sketches and computer software, Dr. Jack Hodgins (TJ Thynes) who specializes in organic materials and Dr. Zack Addy (Eric Milligan) who knows more about bones than, well, Bones. Each member of the team adds to a complete whole not only in their expertise but in their character functions as well.For the first two seasons we were allowed to explore the world of the ""squints"", Booth's nickname for the intelligent research team at the Institute. But as the show continued, we watched as Booth came to appreciate each individual in their own way. We also watched the sexual tension between Booth and Bones grow in the most subtle of ways as they worked case after case together.There you have it, the main crux of the series. But it's more than that. It involves cases being solved using clues found only by this team of forensic anthropologists. Each week they discover clues no mere mortal would find with the naked eye. And each week Booth and Bones have the chance to put the guilty behind bars. At the same time we get to watch the interplay between the characters as well.What you have here is a combination of age old detective show combined with the technological side shown in the various CSI series. But rather than focus mainly on the science of evidence we get that as well as interaction between characters in more familiar TV territory. Romance and buddy systems are seen in each episode as opposed to straight police work.This brings us to season three. This time around we begin with Bones acting unlike herself. Could it be because Booth sent her father to prison at the end of last season? Could it be the attraction between Bones and Booth became too much? Or could it be because Zack had decided to take a leave and head out to work in Iraq?  Just as the stories offer clues to the murders, the series offers clues and at times answers to these questions.As the season starts we find Hodgins and Angela still very much in love, still planning on marrying and still searching for the man who was a one night stand Angela married in a drunken stupor. This was an arc left open from season two that finds an answer this year.Zack returns from Iraq a bit different. Fortunately for fans of the series (and Zack) he shows up in the first episode, just in time to save the day and help find the criminal.Bones and Booth start off not nearly as close as before. Whichever of the reasons discussed that seem to have had an effect on Bones is clearly visible from the first minutes of episode one. And as the pair start to work things out, they begin therapy to help with their work.The first show offers a new challenge for viewers and the team as they encounter a secret cannibalistic society that has left their calling card. While the Gormogon killer may not be a familiar name to most, it will be by the end of this season. Not only are the guilty not found by shows end but they continue to show up during the season.A more in depth view of Bones sex life is offered as well (no, not seen) as we begin to meet the men she dates. This seems to upset Booth who does his best to hide it. The affection between these two characters may be more blatant than Scully and Mulder of X FILES but it is still held in check for the present.Humor, mystery, relationships and friendship are all regular topics in each episode of the series. And Season Three brings forth more of the human characteristics of each member of the forensic family found here. It is these human qualities and interaction between characters that makes this show the success that it is. While Bones comes off as cold and out of touch with the world around her, Seely comes off as having lived more than his years would seem. Put these two together and you come up with one of the most successful teams since Nick and Nora Charles.Extended episodes, alternate episodes and more make this box set worth adding to your collection. And if you don't have them already, buy the first two as well.This is a fresh series with great acting that makes the entire production believable. And that is what makes for good TV. And good TV now means good DVDs. Take a 3 day weekend or the holidays to get acquainted with the Bones family. It's a great mystery filled time for all."
The bones series are one of the best if you like crime and love then these are the series for you
"I didn't think it possible that another TV show would create another relationship with so much chemistry as the one Mulder and Scully shared. This is the kind of relationship where two people are perfect together in every single way, they fight for each other, the save each other and you know, deep down, that they belong together. Oh, and the sexual tension is so obvious everyone knows about it! And even though you live for the glances, for the touch of the hand, for a single kiss (The Santa in the Slush), you are still hesitant to see them romantically together. You don't want to mess up a perfect thing.Season 3 sees a lot of changes, the Gormogon storyline; Brennan's father, Max, finally goes to trial, Both and Brennan go through some very interesting psych therapy, Jack and Angela look to find the name of her husband and the team experiences loss. Although short (15 episodes), the season was quite good, with tons of surprises, chaos, and plenty interesting cases. Great season.This season really delves into the Booth and Brennan relationship starting with Brennan's antagonistic feelings against Booth and her reluctance to go into the field or work with him directly. This is all a result of the events ofBones Second Season. Things gets solved and their relationship is fixed; just in time to solve the next case. This is a great crime-solving duo that works great together."
"I'm a big Bones fan, and this was simply th best price and free shipping. Sold. It came quickly too."
The series kept getting better and better.  The interaction between Bones and Booth started to really progress.  The cases took on some weird overtones.
Too bad it only ran for one season. Jeff was in top form. He showed emotions that I thought were beyond his acting ability. The story's were top notch.
"You will enjoy this show. It has just what your looking for, excitement, drama and those scenes that almost take your breathe away!"
"Enjoyed this series, and the plots.. They were really interesting, and I would recommend it as light entertainment.  Acceptable for young people."
"Don't know why this show didn't last longer than it did, although....I am a Jeff Goldblum fan and I've found that most people are not. Liked the subtle humor, witty sarcasm, and character interaction.  The premise was unique and opened the show to a lot more episodes than it enjoyed. Too bad."
"I am a die hard Jeff Goldblum fan and absolutely loved this show. I am sorry they cancelled it, but isn't that always the way the networks operate? This was a quirky show, based on the premise of a homicide detective being able to talk to the ghosts of the murder victims. I would bet there are millions of detectives that would love to have that gift to help solve murders. For Raines, Jeff Goldblum's character, it provides the ideal vehicle for the hilarious, rapid dialogue Jeff is known and loved for. He tries so hard to fight the gift, but when it proves so useful, he then welcomes it. The fun occurs when the ghosts talk when he is with other people and he either fights answering or answers and  then has to cover it up. His murdered partner is the impetus for the &#34;gift.&#34; Raines tries to avoid dealing with the concrete reality of that partner's death by solving others. It enjoyed the few episodes there were."
It is terrible that it was so short of a run. It never lost that special thing that kept me watching.
"Ok so it started off well and then about the time of the writers strike it had a bad episode that could have killed this for me and then bam, I don't know what happened but suddenly the story is flying the action is interesting and the forever knight remake is reborn with new power and vigor not seen since, well forever knight. The episodes are great except for one and even though they are good they keep getting better and better. This has that real touch that goes so well with honest in your face fantasy, like dead like me? the dead zone? you'll like this. it's a keeper."
Now this is a very exciting and sexy show! I would advise taking all your heart medications before you watch. You will definitely need to cool down after and episode of this!
"One well done and outstanding show.  But it was a victim of a writers strike action.  Shame.  Great acting and stories.  Too me, a must have DVD set."
this show was excellent to watch.  Alex made a very sexy vampire.  WOW  I liked the shows and the action scene.  Excellent writing too.  Should have lsted longer.
"This is a review for Amazon Instant Video on Moonlight. Compared to the series, you do not miss much here when it is this or DVD. You have some extras but they are not that much or that often, and they are normally interviews and nothing more. For that reason, i think it works out.Moonlight is a story about Mick St. James and a human he has a past with. In the pilot there is a ""vsaampire killing"" case Mick looks into, and this is something that Mick finds dangerous. Apparently vampires have their way of living and concealing, and they do not like attention. This rleationshiip continues on through the show, and this and another one will come to define it.As far as a show on the supernatural, i liked it. It had a lot and it even allowed people to do things that a lot of shows seem to miss out on. The efffects, while not amazing, are great, and the acting was a lot better than anything I expected. Honestly, i thought the show might scream timber and fall a few episodes in but it kept the season going and it answers a lot. We get to know Mick, vamps, some humans, an a weird experiment that is going on.Its worth watching.As with all shows, there are filler episodes as well. That can be one of the great things about this, because you do not have to wathc everything. Still, missing is missing and this, a 5/5 show that is still hanging around, might find you enjoying it.It is hard not to."
I love this little human and vampire romance. There is absolutely great chemistry between Alex and Sophia. They make it all plausible.Now there are quite a few vampire shows around. Moonlight was just ahead of the times.
"Out of all the Stargate spin-offs this is my favorite. Every episode was pretty much engaging and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Sorry it went of the air so early after 5 seasons not reaching the 10 seasons like Stargate. However, at least we can buy the past seasons or view through Amazon Prime."
Have finished Season 4 for the series. Am still enjoying the Sci-Fi thriller and have started the fifth season.  What a great way to catch on your missed series from being stationed overseas during the majority of the period.  Strongly recommended.  The key to good SciFi is identifying new technology fiction that meets the challenges of known theories that have a great opportunity for sometime in the future of coming true.
As good as SG-1. One of my all-time favorite sci-fi shows. I only wish they would make more like this!
"I have watched this series several times. A mix of colorful characters, with some humor from Dr. McKay played by Davd Hewlett and a handsome badass hero in the form of Colonel Shepherd, played by Joe Flannigan. These are the earth people. They travel through a Stargate to explore other worlds and pick up Tayla, a beautiful native of another planet and our first glimpse of the gorgeous hunk from Game of Thrones, Jason Mamoa who plays Ronan, from the planet Seteda. Adventure awaits as the explore other planets and learn of a formidable foe, the Wraith, who like to draw the life out of humans. Altogether a very entertaining ride."
Clean and fun Sci-fi. Not as dark and mature as Stargate Universe. Most of this felt like a clear good vs evil. Excellent effects budget and decent acting for a TV Sci-Fi. Hate that it was canceled so soon.
"New people compared to the 1st 3 seasons.  Amanda Tapping joins from original SG.  Dr. Beckett character returns.  Final showdown with the replicators (evil).  Teyla is pregnant.  Great space battle scene.  Hot space nomad returns.  Oh, and Jewel Straite from Firefly is the new medical officer. . .hell yea.  There is alot of action and enough CGI to whet the appetite."
one of my favorite shows.  it miss it very much and look forward to a movie (that's what they promised)
"The series is set in a another galaxy where there are dangers unknown to the team from Earth.  If you like stories about exploration, you'll enjoy this show."
"First of all, I don't do the whole spoiler thing so i just want to say how great this show is. Stargate Atlantis is definitely one of my favorite shows, I've already watched the whole series twice, and thinking about a third time through, I honestly don't think there's a dull episode, It's a little like Stargate Sg-1, but way better, Sg-1 is pretty good seasons 1-7 but I'm struggling to get through season 8, It's just like they ran out of idea's, and the bad guy's, the Go'uld, get old very quick, but the wraith on the other hand are  great villains. The only thing I didn't like about this show was that there were only 5 seasons, I literally crave this show. But all in all, if you like Si-Fi, you'll definitely love this show, and even if you don't like Si-Fi, I think you'll still like it, 5 stars all the way for this show."
"This definitely was one of my most favorite shows, can never get enough of Stargate Atlantis, great plots, great acting, great team, except when McKay keeps wining, great effects."
I'm a Stargate fan since the original movie came out.  The original TV series SG-1 was a good one that lasted many seasons.  I checked this one out after watching the SG-1 series to the end.  This one has a different spin but a similar show (same creators).  I've enjoyed this one as well.
"The cast works extremely well together.  The episodes are well written and directed.  There are comical, suspenseful, action, and drama focused episodes that bring out the different aspects of the characters and plot."
I love this show. Quite a bit more than ag-1. The characters are just quite interesting.I have to add words
"While with the introduction of Sam Carter from Sg1 helps boost the fanbase and ratings for the series overall the series has reached a decent peak in its entertainment and sci-fi value for many sci-fan fans of this series and others.  While it came as no surprise it did feel a little unneeded to make a formal couple out Shepard and Teyla but oh well, also it's nice to see that the writers have allowed the side characters to have their own romantic relationships in the series too.  While we still have the Wraith and Replicators in the series they haven't seemed as much the viable threat they were made out to be in the previous seasons or series though they still are a threat.  The season shows the strong point of the series until the final season which sadly concludes this growing but sadly stumped series."
"I didn't watch it when it first came out on TV. Because I was into SG1 and didn't think spinoffs were any good. But now that I watch the series, I think it was excellent. It is well done and the characters have become endeared to me like SG1."
Great family show. We really enjoy it. Science fiction is a family favorite. The characters are easy to relate to.
"Great adventure series and good story lines and character development.  It obviously has a big budget and the sets are gorgeous.  The art direction is tops.  My only criticism is that the writers are hell-bent over leather to kill off favorite main characters, i.e., Dr Beckett, Elizabeth Weir, etc.  I think this series could have run much longer had these characters been allowed to remain.  The Wraith are some of the most intriguing space villains ever.  Deserves the 5 stars."
Atlantis is a fast sexy sci-fi made for TV that exceeds all expectations. I would highly recommend to anyone into sci-fi or action adventure.
"This is the most coolest series. It never lacks for adventure. It has suspense, drama, scary stuff that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It has some funny ones sometimes like when Dr. Mckay had another persons consciousness inside his brain that was hilarious among others. you can't  beat this series it's one of the best. you won't be disappointed. try it you'll see."
"All she says is ""that's hot"".  I'm watching the shows in chronological order, they're pretty good.  I gave it 5 stars because of Paris Hilton."
This is one of my favorite shows. I personally find it to to be inspirational. I have seen all of the episodes and wish they would bring it back the cliff hanger at the end of season 4 waa intense
I like it because the characters make me feel boring but normal.  Too bad it is gone.  Good thing they have the videos on line.
"The 3rd season with Earl and his friends is as funny and crazy as the previous ones! If you like dark & dirty humor, then here's the show for you!"
"I've said it before and I'll say it again, one of the beauties of DVD is the low costs of picking up entire seasons of TV series you may have missed. Be it work related, child related or simply not having time related, it's nice to be able to get a whole season and watch episodes back to back. Like this week's release, MY NAME IS EARL SEASON THREE.For those of you who have yet to watch EARL, Jason Lee (star of numerous Kevin Smith movies) stars as Earl Hickey, a bumbling goofball whose life has consisted mostly of low end scams, thefts and mischief in general. Earl's life changes when he scratches off a winning lottery ticket...only to watch it fly away after being hit by a car.While recuperating, Earl has an epiphany. Karma had worked its magic on him, causing him to lose the ticket in return for all of the bad things he's done in his life. While lying there, Earl writes up a list of all the people he has done wrong with the intention of correcting his mistakes. As he sets out to do so, the ticket finds its way back to him.Each episode of EARL features Earl and his bumbling idiot-though-lovable brother Randy (Ethan Suplee) trying to track down one of the people on his list and making up for whatever Earl did to them in the past. Season three starts off with Early not being able to do so since he made a big correction at the end of season two.Earl took the rap for his ex-wife Joy (Jaimee Pressley) and is now in prison. Fortunately for Earl, a number of the people he made mistakes with can be found there as well. And in helping them, he finds himself owing favors to others in prison, including the warden (Craig T. Nelson).As Earl tries to do right, Joy feels guilty so takes Earl's brother in with her. Talk about a conflict of interests. Joy is self centered, cheated on Earl with crab cook Darnell ""Crabman"" Turner (Eddie Steeples) to whom she is now married and is the biggest stereotype of trailer trash foul mouthed gorgeous redneck that you will find on film. Randy on the other hand is about as simple minded as you can get without having brain damage. The two together are like oil and water.The first half of the season is spent in prison with Randy dealing with the loss of his brother that evolves into Randy becoming a guard at the prison (after scoring a 55 on the tests, the highest score ever). Joy deals with being the surrogate mother to her half sister's baby, requiring her not to have labor induced or have any pain meds during birth. And Earl? Earl does his best to pay back Karma.Want an example of the comedy involved here? It's difficult to choose from one of the many scenes that are side splittingly funny. But how about the one where Randy at the Fourth of July fair finds his head covered in cotton candy. It appears that he got so involved watching the guy make it that he got dizzy and fell into the cotton candy machine resulting in his head being covered in enough cotton candy that he can't see. Okay I know, it loses something in the translation but trust me, it is funny as all get out when you see it.The guests in episodes help make this show one of the funniest on TV. But it is the core players who make it worth watching week after week...or in this case disc after disc. Jason Lee is a treasure, performing as the smart alek with attitude who isn't near as smart as he thinks he is. But in the end, Earl always sees the bright side of things and offers a touch of wisdom that makes the episode a morality fable.Pressley as Joy is hilarious. Her mouthy attitude, strong willed character and ability to see that the world actually DOES revolve around her (at least in this trailer park) are a joy to behold. And Suplee as Randy does an incredible feat in making a bumbler not only appealing as a sympathetic character, he makes it easy to laugh when he messes up as well.The rest of the casts are just as acceptable but it is these three that stand out. Season three made me laugh out loud more than once and on more than one occasion, I found myself having to pause the disc because I was laughing so hard. If you are in need of a laugh, you can't do much better than this show. This is not just one to watch, it is one to include in your personal collection."
I really enjoy this series. The cast is outstanding. Joy is the funniest gorgeous woman I have ever seen.
"I love the character of Earl, along with all the other comically characters in this show. This dvd season 3 is full of comedy to watch. You never know what Earl is going to do next on his list. Each list item is a new adventure that Earl wants to fix in a positive way. :0)"
Funny got better as seasons went on.  Whish it was still on.  Like to see re make with same people jus tdon't wait to long.
"I have been a fan of this show from the beginning, never missing an episode, but season 3 but put the 1st 2 seasons to shame.  Jensen Ackles really got a chance to show what a great actor he is.  The season begins after Dean sells his soul to save Sam and has less than a year to live.  Ackles shows the broad range of emotions that one would feel knowing that they will de soon, along with terror and denial he feels about spending eternity in hell.  I thought that the show wouldn't have anywhere to go after Dean killed the yellow eyed deamon who killed their mother and Sams girlfriend in the S2 finale, ending the storyline that had driven the show for the 1st 2 seasons.  What we got with season 3 was a revitalized show that was alternated between stories that were heartbreaking , ones that kept you on the edge of your seat, and ones that made you laugh so hard you ended up crying anyway.  The best episodes of the season have got to be Mystery Spot, and Ghostfacers.  In Mystery Spot the Jokster Demon from season 2 returns and tourtures Sam by making him relive the same day over and over until Dean dies a horrific death at the end and the day rewides.  You will laugh out loud at the creative ways the writers kill Dean over and over and see a new side of Sam when he loses his brother and realizes that he is alone for the 1st time in his life.  Ghostfacers was a very different episode that brought back the bumbling ghost hunters from season 1.  Thay had decided to create their own show and collide with Dean and Sam on a hunt.  The entire episode is shot with handheld cameras (a spoof of Ghost Hunters on SciFi) and actually has a great storyline included.  If you have never watched the show before, you are missing out.  This is truly one of the best shows on TV, and not just for the action and effects but amazing performances of everyone involded."
"This is the best season so far. the first season shows how the boys get started as they hunt for their father. the find him, and hell breaks loose.the second season the hunt the demon that killed mom and dad, Sam dies, Dean sells his soul, and all hell (litterally) breaks loosethird season Dean has the year to live, Sam is trying to find ways to save him while demons and demigods tell him he can't. there is a macabre sense of humor that shows from time to time: FBI agent ""I shot the sherif"" Dean ""But you didn't shoot the deputy"". the writing is nothing but fantasticI haven't made it to the end of the season yet, but i wanted to be number 205 in the five star catagory. this show has gone far and fast and there is no telling what will happen next, but i am loving it"
"Love this show and these dvd's. I can never get enough supernatural. characters are convincing, script is well written, effects are great. I think its one of the best storylines I have ever seen of any show on tv. Season 5 is currently airing, its intense. so buy this and catch up!"
"I love this tv series.  I have all 4 seasons and will pre-order the 5th.  If you love stories about supernatural things, you will love this series.  lots of action and comedy."
"shows on TV right now.  I've been loving Supernatural since the first episode and Sam/Dean have really grown in the series.  From fledgling demon hunters to full on demon killers, but still at the same time keeping that thing that seperates us from them...their humanity.  Yes, he sold his soul to save his brother and that is one of the major storylines in Season 3.  As the brothers race towards finding a way to undo this pact that has been made.Not knowing what lies ahead for them it never stops the Winchester brothers from having a blast doing what their Dad trained them to do.  It's violent, dark and grown up, but at the same time its light hearted and funny to watch.  Supernatural isn't like any show out there and that's what makes me love it so much.  Especially after the Season 3 epic cliffhanger, I can't spoil for folks that haven't seen it yet.But wow!  It's something else and will leave you wanting Season 4 to hurry and come out on DVD asap.  I love all the characters in story whether recurring (Bobby) or not.  They all make this show something special and kudos to the writers, producers, directors, set designers, lighting effects, custome designers and everyone else work on the show.  Thanks for making Supernatural just that."
"All my favourite television shows suffered greatly from the Writer's Strike. Not here. Supernatural Season Three has some of the best episodes yet. The groundhog day episode, the lucky rabbit's foot, the witch coven. the sixteen episodes are more solid a season that most can do with a full 22 episode season. All in all, it is vastly superior when compared to the previous seasons.The producers included a bit more than the standard fare of special features, more to help fatten the DVD load. There was almost no need for this, given the character growth and the strength of the metaplot. We still have 5.1 audio tracks and the CGI is a heck of a lot better.The season ramps up with a finale that we've seen coming for a year. And in the end we are left wondering just how the hell this show can keep going. But in fact, it does. And it's storytelling at its best."
The third season has Sam and Dean trying to save Dean soul from hell. They have killed the yellow eyed demon and are now trying to save Dean from going to hell because he made a deal with a demon to save Sam. As we have learned from this series that this family keeps makking deals with demons and pay the price. It cost them there father life. Season was very good. They hunt down demons and other stuff. Gets slow in the middle but the ending is very well done! A jaw dropping ending that will leave you speechless. They also have that actress who plays Maggie from the Walking Dead in it when she was younger. She was ok.
Love the DVD set and beautiful packaging.  I love this series and have bought the entire series available.  Received set when promised.
"I took a chance and bought the first season.I had not even finished the first episode, paused the dvd player,and ordered the second season. Can't wait for season three!"
"This is the season when Dean dies because he has dealt Sam's survival in the place of his own life by trading his soul with a demon, and he got a one year delay before going to hell. The whole season is going to turn around the dilemma for Sam and for Dean. Sam will resist the idea of Dean's death and will do all he can to save him, including by dealing his own death instead, but Dean is willing to die since he-they has-have given everything to this war against the Monster, the yellow eyed demon that killed their mother, and that they supposedly killed at the end of the second season, and this war has brought them nothing as for life, enjoying life, etc. Better dying than just surviving on nothing at all, or even a dry bone. For Sam the only problem is that Dean's death means he will be alone to go on with this fight and that frightens him though we see him operating a couple of times alone and he can manage properly.We could think then the season would be rather dull. But there you are wrong and the next season is being prepared very carefully.First it is fun to fight demons. So we have a Christmas special this year, and a real Christmas special it is with reminiscences from the past when the two little boys were alone for Christmas when their father was hunting. And neither of them both forgot to get a present, no matter how little, for the other since anyway Dean did not believe in Father Christmas and Sam was told it was all a fake, a scam, a tall tale. But the Christmas party they enjoy now with two nice little Celtic survivors who decide to have some fun for this Christmas and enjoy a good old cannibalistic feast gives quite some enlightening for to the celebration. We can wonder if the mention of the pagan and Christian sides of Christmas, and this including Christmas in the show mean something or at least are there for a reason; other than simply a Christmas special because it was broadcast one week or two before Christmas, though the series being in real time, there is no reason why Christmas should not be present, especially since it shows how the two brothers when younger and forlorn, some could say neglected if not abandoned by their father, looked after each other including with Christmas presents that were valueless in themselves though emotionally of great value for the two boys.Second it is Reality Show TV time really and fully and they have to have their own reality show and they do with some real blood and flesh dummies who want to visit and track if not trap the ghost who is haunting the Morton House. One of the dummies will die in the adventure, the intern of course which does not count much, not one of the brains of the caper, and they will not be able to put the money in their bank though because Sam and Dean have manipulated their computers with a big magnet that erased all the programs, reformatted the hard disk in a jiffy.Third let's think of the poor children that are chased away from the TV and this series because of the gross nature of these horrible monsters. So let's have one full episode on fairy tales. Unluckily it is a girl in a coma who should have been unplugged from the survival equipment a long time ago by her own father, the doctor, who is reenacting in real life the fairy tales her father is telling her in her coma. The versions of Snow White and the Little Red Riding Hood are amazing and the way Sam and Dean manage to save the poor Little Red Riding Hood from the Big Bad Wolf is heroic and absolutely entertaining for very young children who will be able to learn that they must not go alone to the woods nor get in the cars of strangers.But the war against evil is serious and has little to do with a fairy tale. So let's go back to work, boys.This year is built on the presence of two women. Bela, who could be Bella of course, is a girl whose specialty is to steal ancient objects in order to sell them for a profit. She steals anything the boys, particularly Dean, may have in their pockets. A mummified hand for example, an enchanted rabbit's foot or the famous colt that can kill the Demon with one bullet. But that is too much, far too much and that will lead to the ferocious end of Dean being taken to hell by the Hounds of Hell and will end up, like in Hellraiser and Hellbound, two fairy tales told in many chapters and volumes by Saint Clive Barker, stretched out at the tip end of hooks tied up to chains that are going to dismember him forever and ever, each body part growing back after having been ripped off, I guess. A delicious ending for a monster hunter.A second woman, Ruby, who is a demon possessing a woman, is going to haunt the two boys because she wants to help and Sam is ready if not keen to listen and accept. But Dean and Sam refuse bluntly when she suggests to Sam to learn how to use his psychic power that can defeat Lilith, the demon who is after Dean's life. So he can't in the final confrontation with the girl who was possessed by Lilith and had caused a lot of damage, who has been able to get a whole gang of demons in the neighbors all around, so that the boys are trapped when they finally come into the house where the girl is living. And at the very last minute when Sam is going to kill her he is stopped by Dean who is able to feel demons since he is minutes away from Hell. Lilith in fact is in the body of Ruby who is possessed twice and since the boys do not have the special colt they can't kill the spirit Lilith in Ruby. The spirit keeps them at bay till midnight when the Hounds of Hell are introduced to get Dean away. She is so powerful she can keep Sam at bay against the wall but at the last minute the spirit Lilith goes away leaving Dean in Hell, Sam beaten up against the wall and Ruby with no good sense left in her. End of the season. Let's wait for the next one to revive the good Dean.But there is even more in this season that prepares the next season. They get rid of Gordon, the black hunter and some of his acolytes, all of them black except one. They have decided that psychic people like Sam have to be executed straight away and they have already executed a few. But Gordon will end up a vampire and Sam will behead him with a good old thick cable just as if it were a butter wire cutting up a block of soft butter. Altogether at least four Sam-hunters are eliminated, three of them black. If that is not a bias or maybe a prejudice, what is it then? Once again with these Sam-hunters or hunters of psychic people we have a case of their nave feeling they are doing a good thing when they are only doing what seems to them the only right they can do, though they are trying to destroy the only person who can save them, save humanity.At the same time another black character is redeemed, Special Agent Victor Henricksen, who is possessed. He arrests the two boys on a lead given to him by Bela who is escaping with the Colt. But a whole gang of spirits arrive and start killing people around the police station. The demon in Victor makes him shoot the Sheriff but he is kind of forcefully taken under control by the boys who had managed to get a crucifix and had made some water holy. And the boys exorcise the demon out of him. It is then Victor is redeemed and they organize the siege and the trap that will kill all the demons inside as soon as they are trapped using an infernal contraption: the intercom of the station that broadcasts the exorcising ritual formula. Brilliant. He let the two boys go, but they will learn later with Ruby on TV that the Demon Lilith, possessing a little blonde girl (evil can be everywhere and come in all forms) came herself afterward to get some vengeance and she destroyed the police station into ashes on the ground killing all those inside and close to it, including of course the redeemed FBI Special Agent. Isn't that sad? The two boys have it more and more difficult to save one person and when they do then the demon kills a dozen outsiders and innocent bystanders. But the redemption of Victor Henricksen, Special Agent by profession, is good news after all since that one was saved before being destroyed. His soul will go where it should and that is not in hell.The last remark I would like to make on this series is the great number of allusions to other classics in the field. The Shining by Stephen King is so often alluded too that I will not even specify. Come with me, Come with me, come with me, and you will know. Of course you also have Clive Barker at the end. But you have so many others like the Night of the Living Dead and in a way Michael Jackson's Thriller, If you do have some time and energy left when you have finished watching the next three seasons I would advise you to go back and identify them all. And that's where plagiarism is not what it used to be. Plagiarism used to make pale imitations of real stuff with tit bits stolen here and there, like Canada Dry instead of Whisky and ginger ale instead of real ale. We could of course think of the fake Frankenstein's monster who is the doctor himself and who has become immortal by substituting in his own body the parts that are getting old. Mad scientist, mad doctor, or whatever. There are so many of them running loose and free around in the street. Aren't you afraid of going out to smoke your cancer stick in the yard? I would be if I were you. You might be snatched by two moths from out space. Plagiarism you said? The pleasure is not plagiarized though.I will not insist on the debate between the two brothers and the love that becomes at times dense and impressive, but also at times pathetic and our empathy for the death of the elder brother is wearing out, especially since we know there are three more seasons to go and a fourth one running right now. But the car is also less present in this season. Sam has his own, by the way, and the Impala seems to have been reduced to a gadget in these episodes. It is present for sure, but certainly less than before. I hope it is not for long because I like the machine. The car seems to be less present since their future as a pair of hunters is compromised. They own the car together and it brings them together. The car being their only real possession, something they inherited from their father and that created a unity in their family, keeping them close and bringing them from one point to another together. On the trail leading to Dean's death, the car cannot keep them together or close, because one will surely die and the other is trying to save him by following new paths to save him, sometimes in ill-advised directions.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU with the help of Ivan EVE"
"I LOVE this show, the writing and acting is edgy, fun, poignant, a full range of emotions.  Season one for me was rocky the first time around, was much better the second time I watched it, even then I saw improvement with each episode.  Season two shows what the show could be, and now with season three they have hit their stride!  You will not be disappointed with any season of this show."
This show just keeps getting better and better. All of the mythology and the season long plots are super fun to watch. And the show just keeps getting funnier without losing it's badass-dom. I love it!
"Hello,This show is absolutely wonderful.  My entire family loves watching it and we are definately hooked.  I would recommend this show to anyone.Thanks,"
I like the arc that this series has taken.  The shortened season is a bit disappointing.  However even because of it the storyline of season 3 works.
If you haven't watched any of the Supernatural shows you are missing out on a great show! This show rocks! I really hope they don't end the show after 5 seasons like the creator keeps saying he's going to do. You can keep supernatural stuff going forever! I get the magazine which I highly recommend too. You learn a lot of stuff about the actors and what's going on with the show in the book. Also has some hot posters too. The music for the show is always awesome! I wish they could get a soundtrack out if they haven't already. I know there were some problems with that in reading the magazine. We can only hope. Once again..I highly recommend this show..you will not be disappointed!
"This show is just one of the best 'supernatural' aka horror related shows of all time. It's got lots of humor and this season; while it's a short one it is still dynamite in terms of writing and acting. The show also has a broad streak of humour to it and that's a good thing too. This blu ray looks great just like the rest of the series does on this format as well, It's a dark show and this really comes out on blu ray as this wasn't shot on hd film.  It has plenty of extras too, thankfully the boys will be back for a seventh season in 2011-12. And that's more good news. I intend to buy this entire show on blu ray for my personal collection; that's how good this show is."
"If it isn't, it's pretty darn close. Supernatural just gets better and better with each passing season. I just watched the third episode of season four last night on TV and it looks like the current season is heading in the right direction. This is the only great show the CW has ever produced. Most people make fun of the network, but I bet they haven't watched this show. It has good acting (the two leads are very likeable), clever and often funny writing, very good special effects, a classic rock soundtrack and a well thought out storyline. Not to mention all the different hot babes that pop up almost every week.Supernatural gets a lot of involvement from the writers and directors of the The X-Files and it shows in it's quality. If your a horror and action fan like me, you won't find any show on TV better than this. Okay, maybe Dexter, but that's more thriller than horror."
"Season 3 of this series has long been viewed as the weakest, but looking back, it has some of the best episodes of the show's six-year run (so far). Fans may miss the intensity of the Yellowed Eyed Demon that taunted the Winchesters in Seasons 1 and 2, but the writers more than make up for it with new ideas, humor and reflections on the show's past. ""Mystery Spot"" and ""A Very Supernatural Christmas"" rank among the best things ever for Supernatural fans, so check this one out knowing that the writer's strike muted what may have been a great season."
"The Gate to Hell is closed, but not without it's consequences.  Demons are out, and now, Sam and Dean are in a race against the clock.  That year Dean has is wasting away."
"Very interesting series, but would likely only make sense if you have seen the first and second seasons. Most episodes have an independent story, but there is a larger story, a thread if you will, in the backdrop which you need to be aware of to make sense of it all.I really enjoyed watching this series and can't wait for the release of the next season on dvd."
This season was wonderful.  Really great characters and plots.
"This season of Supernatural was fairly different from the others. While still carrying an episodic feel there was enough of all elements/characters recurring that it wasn't exactly the same as the first two. This season also started to mix in more light hearted hurmorous episodes among the darker and intense ones, which I didn't mind as I had grown to really like what humor had previously been shown.As for the additions of the female anti heroes, I actually grew to enjoy their presence on the show. Yes, they made the Winchesters look childish but that's actually how they have behaved previously, just no one called them out on it. Also it was pretty interesting to have demons be given more personality and learn that not all of them are completly evil and have motives.Despite that, I did find some flaws within the season. Sam and Deans arguments got even more repetitive, a couple characters from season 2 were written out of this season and the demon army didn't get mentioned that much, which was surprising as I thought total choas would've erupted from the release of those demons.All in all, the show took some new steps that I liked and keeps it going."
I find this seasons very entertaining and the interactions between Sam and Dean refreshing.  This is one of my favorite series that I never get tired of.
"Two major plotlines shape season three of Supernatural.  First, Dean has sold his soul to the Crossroads Demon to save Sam's life and has one year to live before the demon collects on the bargain.  Second, the Winchesters open up a Devil's Gate and release hundreds of demons into the world.  Season three runs at a breakneck pace, largely to Dean's impending doom.  His deal is referenced in nearly every episode and you get the sense of being on a trail speeding headlong into the unknown.Two new recurring characters are introduced in season three, both of them female.  First there is the demon Ruby (Cassidy) who becomes Sam's guardian angel (so to speak) looking after him for her own reasons.  Bela Talbot (Lauren Cohan), sometimes ally but usually foe, appears in six episodes.  Bela deals in stolen magical talismans and the like but is hiding her own dark secret.Season three is the darkest and grimmest season so far.  As time ticks away, the Winchesters become more desperate and careless to find a way to free Dean from his deal.  With hundreds of demons on the loose you might think that the season would become one-dimensional but that is not the case.  The writers did a good job of sprinkling in side stories into the writer's strike-shortened, 16-episode season.Among those shows that separated themselves from the main plotline were ""Bedtime Stories"" where a comatose girl brings the Brothers Grimm's fairy tales to life and the wonderfully amusing (and gory) ""A Very Supernatural Christmas"" in which the boys encounter a pair of Pagan Gods disguised as average suburbanites, who are feasting (literally) on their neighbors.Among the best episodes of the season (in addition to A Very Supernatural Christmas) are ""Jus in Bello"" as the Winchesters are captured by the FBI and are jailed in a small town Colorado jail until they can be moved.  The show is inspired by Fort Apache: The Bronx as dozens of demons converge upon the jail intent on killing everyone inside.  For the first time we hear about the demon's new leader, Lilith.In ""Fresh Blood"", the Winchester-hating Gordon, also a hunter, escapes from prison and begins hunting the boys down again but has a fatal encounter with a vampire, turning him into a creature of the night.People are receiving calls from the dead loved ones in ""Long Distance Call"".  While the people are overjoyed to hear from their deceased family members, the Winchesters do not believe whatever is calling them are benevolent spirits.The season and Dean's fate concludes with ""No Rest for the Wicked"" as the clock strikes midnight on the last night of Dean's deal.  While it was a solid season finale, it felt very rushed.  The last episode would have been better served as a two-hour finale but that probably was not possible due to the strike.One of the major developments of season three was Sam's development as a stronger character.  When Dean tells Sam that they have to kill Gordon before he kills them, he surprises Dean by agreeing.  Sam becomes more forceful and takes the lead on several occasions as Dean tries to prepare him for life as a solo hunter.  The only disappointment about season three is that Cassidy will not be back for season four as Ruby, as her contract was just for one season.  She is replaced in season four by Genevieve Cortese.While the five-disc set does not feature any audio commentaries like the first two seasons did, it does come with episode introductions by the various directors or writers.  Other extras include three featurettes on special effects, Dean's Impala, and the ""Ghostfacers episode"" along with a gag reel."
"With the Winchesters' dad gone, they are truly on their own except for a friend or two.  All they have is each other, though I wish I could count the Impala.Some spoilers may follow.......There is an even darker tone this season, if you can imagine that, with Dean having made a literal deal with the devil to save Sam by going to hell--which he absolutely does not deserve.  There is constantly a sense of time running out, with Lilith doing awful things to our boys and to others, Dean doing some crazy things because he knows what's coming, and Sam looking at him with a blend of pity, fear, and heartbreak over his brother's horrific fate.  I won't soon forget the last few minutes of this season's final episode, and I don't want to reveal them here.Since there is a season four, I can only hope that Sam finds a way to rescue Dean.On a lighter note, the gag reel is very funny, as they always are."
"You know something? It really irks me when a TV Show airs on TV and barely has any time to show everyone just what it is capable of. I've seen this happen, one too many times, with my favorite shows. Such is the case with Tremors, the TV series.Taking place after the third film in the Tremors series, the series picks up with the residents of Perfection attempting to co-exist with a graboid (or El Blanco, as he's affectionately called) while also dealing with the government, real estate developers and other assorted characters. It originally aired on the SCI-FI Channel(which is now called Sy-Fy) in 2003 and, by all intents and purposes, was a good success but was cancelled because it didn't reach the ratings that Farscape had(which is the show it replaced on the channel).Watching all thirteen episodes, I never once found an episode that didn't keep me interested until the end. I know this is going to seem like a stretch but I liked this alot more than some of the films it was derived from."
"Perfection, NV: A tiny western town of dust, sand... and giant carnivorous graboids burrowing underground.And after three movies of battling the graboids, shriekers and ass-blasters, fans of the ""Tremors"" series finally got a (tragically short-lived) TV spinoff. ""Tremors: The Complete Series"" takes everything fun about the movies tacks in some conspiracies and freaky mutants -- there are a few mildly grating characters, but it's still deliciously fun and strange.A new guy named Tyler Reed (Victor Browne) rolls into Perfection, intending to take over the Desert Jack Graboid Tours... just in time for El Blanco to go on a berserk feeding frenzy.It isn't the last graboid-related problem -- Burt Gummer (Michael Gross) and the other Perfectionites must deal with a gourmet assblaster, a scientist training shriekers to be rescue animals, a graboid attacking a town of UFO-fanatics, graboid-rights activists who claim the Perfectionites are killing El Blanco, and a pair of mob thugs who run afoul of El Blanco and lost a very important key.And pretty soon there are even worse problems. Burt finds that a strange substance called MixMaster, leaked out of a secret laboratory, begins to infect the valley and turns the creatures into bizarre hybrids -- giant shrimps, omnivorous termite/maggots, a mineshaft ""ghost,"" or an acid-spitting reptilian plant.""Tremors: The Complete Series"" was cancelled after only thirteen episodes, but those episodes are brilliant from beginning to end. And they have everything you'd expect from a Tremors series -- lots of big guns, explosions, orange goop, and highly imaginative ways to kill various monsters (including with weather balloons and tar).For the record: the MixMaster, the secret lab and the eccentric old scientist all seem rather hokey, but soon they mesh nicely into the existing ""Tremors"" mythology. Think a funnier, lighter ""X-Files"" vibe. And the writers do an excellent job, weaving clever plots with plenty of action, a bit of tragedy (Cletus and Project 4-12), and lots of hilarious dry humor, especially regarding Burt (""Somebody get up on the wrong side of the bunker today?"").Gross is, as always, brilliant as the endearing survivalist Burt -- he has to start a survival school, wrangle with a hard-headed government rep, and deal with a town of hostile UFO-fanatics. Browne is decent as the new ""everyman lead,"" and there are some solid supporting performances by Lela Lee, Marcia Strassman, Sarah Rafferty, and especially Christopher Lloyd as a wonderfully eccentric scientist-turned-desert-hermit.Two of the cast aren't quite as endearing -- J.D. Walsh's pushy ubernerd just ends up being annoying. And Gladys Jimenez's Rosalita is a fun character (an ex-showgirl with a shady history) but sometimes it feels like she's there to run around in filmy shirts.""Tremors: The Complete Series"" has a couple bumps in the road, but overall it's a brilliant spinoff to the classic B-movie series. A must-see... or if you're a graboid, a must-eat."
enjoyable series with Michael Gross and a cast of cool new characters. Short lived with only about 12 episodes.Relive the Grabbers.
"I was late to the Stargate Party, watching them on amazon and dvd just as the series was ending, but the series has grown on me and become something of a favorite.This two part episode, which explores Sam's relationship with the Tokra/Goa'ould that briefly inhabited her is a strong episode with good plots that add to the larger arc that Stargate slowly builds over its many seasons of mostly stand-alone episdoes. A favorite."
"When we last left Our Heroes, they were on Apophis' ship, facing the impending destruction and/or enslavement of everyone on Earth.So unsurprisingly, the second season of ""Stargate SG-1"" can only get better from there on. In fact, this is when the clever, innovative sci-fi series really started to gel together, with more intriguing storylines, character arcs, and some new alien allies -- basically, it all blooms.Intending to blow up Apophis' ship, our heroes get captured by the Jaffa and thrown in a cell -- only to be unexpectedly rescued by Bra'tac (Tony Amendola), Teal'c's old teacher. As Earth mounts a pitiful defense against the Goa'uld, SG-1 joins with a small band of rebel Jaffa to stop Apophis' invasion -- but they may have to leave one of their number behind.Obviously the Goa'uld make things awkward throughout the season, with the second episode featuring Sam (Amanda Tapping) being possessed by a Goa'uld during a rescue mission -- but it seems that it's part of a rebel Goa'uld faction called the Tok'ra. Teal'c's (Christopher Judge) son is kidnapped and brainwashed, and Daniel (Michael Shanks) finds that his beloved wife is pregnant with Apophis' child.And of course, SG-1 has to deal with lots of other stuff -- insectile transformations, black holes, prison planets, Native American ""spirits,"" invisible bugs, hostile alien orbs, reliving their most traumatic memories in a VR world, and time traveling to 1969. And O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) gets an ancient repository of knowledge downloaded into his head -- and he'll die if they can't reverse it.""Stargate SG-1"" really got into its stride in the second season -- the basic Air-Force-versus-evil-headsnakes story gets expanded out into a bunch of arcs. We get new villains, some surprising new allies, hints about the true origins of the Stargates and the human race, and corrupt factions on Earth who use the spare Stargate for evil ends.The writing gets even steadier and the alien worlds more interesting -- even stuff that sounds goofy, like the planet of singing mushroom-people, somehow works. The drama is stronger, and the sci-fi usage of the Stargate ever more creative, such as when a black hole's gravity well keeps the gate open, and is slowly sucking Earth through the wormhole. Good, tense stuff.Of course, all the action and sci-fi is heavily tempered with comedy. Even in grim situations, there's usually at least a few funny moments, such as Daniel's tour of the custodial closet. And of course, the dialogue is priceless -- most of the good stuff comes from O'Neill (""That's between you and your god. Oh, wait a minute! You are your god! That's a problem""), but Teal'c (""In my culture, I would be well within my rights to dismember you"") and the others usually get some good ones as well.Of the main cast, Amanda Tapping gets the juiciest role in this season -- Sam deals with the impending death of her father, becoming a Goa'uld host, and trying to deal with the feelings it left behind. Including a cute Tok'ra boyfriend. Yet when we see Sam's vulnerable sides, Tapping never lets her character be anything but a strong, capable military woman.But the other actors aren't neglected -- Shanks' Daniel grapples with the news that his wife is pregnant with Apophis' baby, while Teal'c faces losing his entire family. Anderson is brilliant as the quirky, capable O'Neill, but he really gets brilliant when Jack's brain is being overwritten -- he has to emote and communicate without a comprehensible word.The second season of ""Stargate SG-1"" is where the story began to really get great, building up a series of strong story arcs, funny dialogue, and strong characters. Definitely a must-see."
One of the best SciFi shows out there. I Can't stop watching this show. If you enjoy good stuff you'll enoy this.
Yea. This was the best SG-1 I've ever seen. The only thing that would have put it over the topis if it was a tw part that had more time to develop the last 15 minutes of the show.
"If you love your Sci-Fi as much as I do, then you&#34;re in for the ride of your life with &#34;Stargate SG-1 Season 2&#34; .  This show never did disappoint me! It has &#34;jaw-dropping&#34; action all the way through it and then some. The good guys don&#34;t always win in this block buster of a hit, but when they get the upper hand and do win, you feel triumphant right with them.....AT HOME! Every one of the Seasons in this series is just a part of the whole.....wait until you see how it comes out in the end! Yes, I very highly recommend watching a show like &#34;Stargate SG-1 Season 2&#34;. I think you may even begin to like Sci-Fi, too!"
"There have over the years been a number of great shows that followed a good first season with a great second one, including THE X-FILES, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, and FARSCAPE.  There are a variety of reasons for this in each case.  With STARGATE, it is the increasingly complex storyline about the relations between various races and cultures with access to stargates.  Season One was basically your stargate-of-the-week format, each week an individual adventure with no real connections with any other episode.  This is the format usually preferred by network executives, since it allows new viewers to join a show without much background.  Serious fans, on the other hand, vastly prefer the complex storylines, where each week's episode does not stand on its own, but is embedded in an ongoing saga, almost like a chapter in a huge novel.  This has been and probably will continue to be an ongoing struggle between the creative talent and the network bureaucracy, though my own hope is that the success of shows like LOST will pave the way for more complex formats.Season Two does not tell a single unified story the way that FARSCAPE or BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER did, but it does start spinning out a largely political struggle about the five races (only a few that we have met by the end of the season) aligned against the Goa'uld.  The STARGATE story by the end of Season One was still a relatively simple affair; by the end of Season Two it was already sufficiently complex as to make following the details difficult for a newcomer.  But it was not only the season long arc; the individual episodes improved in quality as well as the writers came to know the characters better.  All in all, the improvement in the show from Season One was not unexpected, but it was delightful nonetheless.The only sour note in Season Two was the season finale.  Most shows try to build up to a dramatic season-ending episode that both sums up everything that happened in that season and propels the show into the next one.  The season finale for Season Two of STARGATE has to be one of the lamest ever devised.  Most of the problem is that most of the episode was constructed of segments of previous episodes that were simply replayed.  STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION used this method a few times.  My guess is that the latter show used it as a cheap way of creating a new episode.  If 20 minutes of your air time consisted of clips from old shows, then you had dramatically lowered your operating budget.  I do not know why STARGATE employed this method in the season finale, though perhaps they were over budget and had no choice but to go cheap.  Nonetheless, it was a surprisingly false note in an otherwise marvelous season.As with Season One, the story largely focused on the four members of the Stargate SG-1 team, with all other character functioning as supporting characters.  We are introduced to a number of characters who reappear in subsequent seasons, the most important being General Jacob Carter, Samantha's father.  His importance to the show is cemented in the two-part episode that introduces the Tok'ra, a group rebel Goa'uld opposed to the regular Goa'uld, only entering as symbiotes in willing hosts.  Since Sam's father is dying of cancer and the Tok'ra Selmak's host is dying, he is approached to become a host, since Selmak can cure the cancer.  This is also a wonderful resolution to one of my favorite moments of the season, when Sam's father pulls strings to get her admitted to the NASA space program as a potential astronaut.  Not knowing about her work with the Stargate program, he can't understand why she has no interest in going into outer space.All in all, this is a remarkable season for one of the finest Sci-fi series that television has seen.  Although I've never forgiven the Sci-fi channel for failing to renew FARSCAPE, keeping this fine show alive has at least partially redeemed them in my eyes."
"I have recommended this series to anyone that likes a good mix of action, relationships and plot twists.  We watched about 3 episodes a day for weeks!!  Loved It!!"
"The remake of Battlestar Galactica can't be compared to the original, or many series for that matter, because it ended what it started.  While I was disappointed in season 3, overall I have to give the series a great rating.  They finished what they started with a wild ride inbetween, season 3 drift aside.  So many shows are written year to year with extensions to stories based on ratings it is nice to see a story told from beginning to end and while revolutionizing the original story in the process in depth, quality, and provoking thought.  Many subjects are touched on, some left without answer as they should be and most of the others with some form of closure.  I'm thankful the series did as well as it did so that after it was over I could find the chance to watch it when the original was on when I couldn't.  If you are a science fiction fan then don't be prepared to be wowed by the futuristic technology, just a great story told through a fictional setting that allows some deep questions to be presented and great entertainment enjoyed.  Great Job, hope to find more nuggets out there of which I can say the same!!!"
"I've seen in years. I couldn't keep away from it. You do have to watch from the beginning but the acting, directing, developing storyline and soundtrack continued to be exceptional. I highly recommend this show to anyone with good taste."
It is BSG. Do I need to say more? Season 4 is full of good writing and acting along with some fantastic special effect scenes.
One of the best syfy series I've seen. So good I rewatched Caprica series.  Please bring it back. So much more to see.
I've watched this series from beginning to end about a dozen times now.  It seems that I never tire of watching it.
This is the fourth year and it was as well written and filmed as the other three.  The characters are fantastic.  I think Edward Olmos has done a wonderful job in this series.  I liked this series better than the original with Lorne Greene.
"Though I was captivated by the series right from the start, as the seasons progressed it only became more engrossing. I thought that Season Three really took off, and felt that anything attempted beyond that would be a let down. Alas! Season 4 tops them all for the depth of presented ideas, characterization, and adrenalin raising action.THough there were, I believe, 77 episodes in the series, as I approached the final episodes I felt a close friend was packing and departing from me. Then, in keeping with that feeling of loss, the final episode brought, I thought, the reality of life for us all to the center, and that is exactly how any production that &#34;holds the mirror up to nature&#34; as well as this series did should have ended. Magnificent! The finest video production I have ever experienced."
"exceptional story line, character development is outstanding. set decor and CG is on par with the best movies. really a stellar series. whether you are a fan of sci-fi or not, you need to watch this. and there are no little great men, or multi-legged tenacley things."
"One of my favorite television series of all time along with 'The Wire'and 'Breaking Bad'.Like 'The Wire' this is a complex, Dickensian study of human nature,not afraid of asking big questions, and meticulously plotted like agreat novel, so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.Just as 'The Wire' used the overly familiar clich&eacute;' world of the copshow to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions, and 'BattlestarGalactica' uses the sci-fi series, and the idea of human versus robotwars the same way.This is thinking person's sci fi, in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke,or Isaac Asimov. It's about why we are how we are, what it means to bea human being, morality under constant pressure in times of war,fathers and sons, impossible loves, metaphors for modern and recentpolitics and real world situations.My wife, far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes, and we torethrough 5 years of shows in just a few days. It's that addicting.The acting is all at least quite good, and some cast members areremarkable, creating characters full of depth, complexity andcontradiction. The writing is terrific, allowing the characters tochange and grow, but always in ways that make sense, creating seeminglyinexplicable conundrums, only to find surprising, sometimes shocking -but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they'vetaken us. The special effects are generally very impressive for TV,even if they're not really why you watch this show.It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I've everseen, and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out andblown away. I was sad to get to the last episode, just as one is sad tofinish a great book.Things definitely get a little stranger in Season 4.  To some theshow went a little of the rails.  For me it took another step intobrave and twisted plot turns that confounded expectations inthe best way.  I loved this show for the chances it took withstory, with character, with ideas and with style, and season 4might the the pinnacle of that."
"Just an amazing ending, nothing in televison history even comes close to this conclusion.  It's so great it leaves you wanting 10 seasons more."
Fascinating serial that has more twists and turns than an arthritic snake.  It has a constantly changing story line and a very moral base to it and perhaps that is what appeals to me most  -- the integration of moral considerations in a changing universe.  And yet it is not overly moral either with plenty of blood and gore to satisfy that side of the equation.
"The long odyssey of the remnants of the human race comes gradually to a head in the first part of BSG's final season. The wear and tear is starting to show in both ship and crew. Edgy, gritty as hell and operatic in scope, this sets the bar for outer space SF well into the troposphere. There may never be another series or movie to compare. I look forward to owning the entire series and watching it again, from start to finish. Amazing stuff.That said, I do think the producers are screwing us with this split season approach...."
"Warning!  Many, many, many spoilers below.  Do NOT read if you want to stay spoiler free.In watching Season 4.0 of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (when Universal released the first ten episodes of Season Two of BSG at the end of a near six month hiatus they dubbed the first half of the season 2.0 and the second half 2.5; that has been continued with 4.0 and 4.5), I kept thinking of soemthing one of the world's best known self-proclaimed BSG fiends, Joss Whedon, once said.  Sometimes you have to give fans what they need rather than what they want.  Not everything that happened in Season 4.0 was what any of us wanted, but in the end, I think we'll find that we got what we needed.  (BTW, Ron Moore asked Joss to direct an episode of BSG and was more than willing to do so, but preparation for his new series DOLLHOUSE, which will pair BUFFY and ANGEL alumna Eliza Dushku with BSG alumnus Tahmoh Penikett, placed demands on him that prevented him from being able to do so.  Part of me deeply regrets this, because my two favorite shows of all time are BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.  As Jack White says, ""Oh well, oh well, oh well."")No show in the history of TV has had more truly great and shocking endings than BSG.  BUFFY had two season finales that were as good as any I've seen (Seasons Two and Five -- the climatic scene from the Season Five finale, ""The Gift,"" was recently voted in landslide fashion on the official Emmy 2008 website as the Most Memorable Moment in TV history), but because Joss Whedon was always and wisely terrified of the cancellation of his shows, he would not end any season on a cliffhanger.  Ron Moore and David Eick have bravely ended each season with some of the greatest cliffhangers in TV history.  My favorite may have been the end of Season Three:  the Cylon fleet bearing down on the Colonials, who will not be able to engage their FTL (faster-than-light) engines for several minutes, the sitar-drive version of Bob Dylan's ""All Along the Watchtower"" playing in the background.  Apollo goes to investigate a mysterious bogey only to discover the deceased Starbuck flying a Viper as shiney and clean as the day it came off the assembly line.  She comforts him with the words, ""It's going to be alright.  I've been to earth.  And I'm going to take us there.""  Then the breathtaking CGI shot of a ""camera"" pulling back over the two Vipers, through the Colonial fleet, through the Cylon fleet, through the nebula, then across the universe until it comes to rest on a beautiful blue planet showing the continent of North America basking in the sun.  It was a jaw dropping moment and the question was whether Season Four could pick up successfully at that moment.Well, of course it could.  And did.  After learning the identity of four members of the Final Five we knew that the final season would primarily deal with two major questions:  1) Who is the final Cylon? and 2) Will they reach earth and what will they find there if they do?  I think everyone would have put money on the first question being answered first and the second one in the final episode of the series.  But shockingly the second question was answered first, and in the finale seconds of the final episode before the hiatus.Much of 4.0 focused on Starbuck striving to convince Adama and everyone else that whe was not a Cylon and that she really did know the way to earth.  Though many harbor deep suspicions, in the end Starbuck is able to persuade the fleet to go where she believes earth can be found.  In an absolutely brilliant moment, she succeeds.  I had managed to avoid spoilers (in fact, though I was a pretty well known poster on the official BSG board on Scifi.com, I stopped visiting there in order to avoid spoilers) so I had absolutely no idea that they were going to reach earth so much earlier than anyone had assumed.  Indeed, even in interviews leading up to the episode, Ron Moore indicated that they would get to earth before the end of the series, not giving any clues that in fact it would be in the very next episode.  So a viewer's first shock is that they found earth at all.  Even as the Raptors and other atmospheric spacecraft descend to the earth's surface, another shock takes over.  In one of the great one shots I've ever seen on TV, a camera focuses in close on the bandaged hand of Adama, scooping up liveless soil, a Geiger counter registering high levels of radioactivity.  The camera raises up slowly to register the blank expressions of Adama and, standing beside him, Roslin, who utters the shot's lone word, ""Earth.""  The model 3 Cylon known as D'Anna walks up beside them, horror on her face, as Sharon and Helo walk behind them.  The camera then loosely follows the two of them as they walk all the way to the far right, stopping along the way to register the reactions of the other major surviving characters on the show.  First Cylons Anders and Tory, the same expression of despair on their faces.  Then cutting in front of them Apollo, who walks further to reveal Caprica Six in the background, Baltar sitting in the foreground, and Tyrol behind her.  Six walks past Dee in the foreground over to Colonel Tigh, lightly touching his arm.  Past Apollo, who has stopped walking, past Leoben, briefly back to Sharon and Helo who continue walking, to Starbuck, who turns and walks over to where they have stopped.  The camera continues on its own to reveal a body of water and a destroyed bridge, ruins everywhere.  It is a scene that will remind any viewer strongly of the end of PLANET OF THE APES.  I have to add that there is no hint that this was New York or any other city.  Though one ruin clearly features a large carved cross, apparently denoting a Christian building of some sort, there are no other signs of what they have found.  Many assume that the bridge is the Brooklyn Bridge, but anyone even minimally familiar with that bridge's design knows that it is not.  Some argue that it isn't really earth, but I just don't think that argument holds water.4.0 was not very happy.  These were sad, upsetting, bleak, despairing episodes.  But I truly believe that they were what we needed and not what we wanted.  Most of us would have had more fighting, more combat, more huge space battles.  But we wouldn't have broken new ground or challenged its viewers.  The mark of a great show is that it takes you to places that you couldn't expect existed.  Most of us have impoverished imaginations and as a result think in small, hackneyed ways.  I wasn't always happy with Season Four.  My favorite character is Sharon Agathon and on various boards I speculated that her story had largely ended in Season Three, after the last major question (What would she do when she found out that Hera was alive and that Roslin had stolen her from Sharon?) was answered (Answer:  She would do whatever she needed to get back Hera, but nothing to harm Roslin.).  Season Four showed her as an anti-Cylon zealot, even assassinating a Six who was striving to create some sort of working arrangement with the humans.  We got fewer humorous encounters between Six and Baltar.  We didn't get to visit interesting planets.  Happy times were not had.  But as I've reflected back over the show as a whole, I have been amazed at the astonishing journey that it has taken us on.  In fact, the show in 4.0 even departed from so much of the political allegory that dominated the first two and a half seasons.We are now set up for the final ten episodes of a show that has completely redescribed what it is possible to do within the confines of a science fiction show.  In part it did this by refusing to succumb to a single one of the tried and true conventions of the genre.  And it did this by never repeating itself.  Along with another show that was launched in 2004, LOST, it has helped create a new kind of television narrative:  the very long story.  Other shows had attempted this to some degree.  Each season of BUFFY told a self-contained story, with some elements that carried over from one season to the next.  THE X-FILES spent several seasons on the alien colonization story (though more than half of each season's episodes were standalone episodes).  BABYLON 5 had elements that took the first four seasons to resolve (though there were a number of reasons the narrative wasn't as successful as it should have been).  But LOST and BSG will be the first two that will have told a single story through the course of the show with a beginning, middle, and an end.  Other shows are following in this path.  I think it makes for tremendous television, even if it doesn't always pull in a lot of viewers.Finally, I'd like to engage in a little speculation.  I've made a couple of predictions before.  Both of them turned out correct, even if one of them was only partially correct.  I think I was the first person on the Internet to predict how Sharon would get Hera; because I knew they had only 42 minutes for Sharon to somehow get to the Cylon basestar and back with Hera, I predicted that someone would kill her (with the Cylon prohibition of suicide, I knew she would kill herself) and that she would grab Hera and return to the Colonial fleet, possibly on a heavy raider.  Well, I didn't know they had a Raptor on board, but I got close.  (I know I was the first to post this theory on the official board and it only appeared elsewhere after that).  The second prediction was that Tyrol was one of the Final Five.  What I got wrong was that three others would also be revealed.  My third prediction has been a short list of the final Cylon.  I don't have room to give all of my reasons for my theory, but it hinges on a passage in a book that Roslin reads aloud to Adama on the Temple of the Five in ""The Eye of Jupiter.""  She reads, ""The five pillars represent the five priests who are devoted to the one whose name cannot be na--"" and she is cut off by Adama, who says, ""Laura.""  I argue that this is a literary convention in which the one whose name cannot be named is indirectly revealed.  Basically, I believe the key to the Final Five is that they are crucial to helping Roslin lead the survivors to earth.  Tigh, Tyrol, Tory, and Anders all beautiful fit this.  My other argument is that the final cylon could not have been in a position to respond to the song that the other four heard at the end of Season Four.  Using these two, I came up with the short list of Billy, Kat, and Elosha.  Of the three, Billy was closest to Roslin and he remains my first choice.  Elosha was not, I thought, a sufficiently important character to satisfy the requirements of the final cylon.  Kat slightly fits the bill, and Starbuck's talking to her photo just before they get to earth strengthens her case.  I still think the final Cylon is most likely Billy.  But unless Ron Moore has flat out been lying, neither Adama (especially not Zak) nor Starbuck is the final Cylon.  We'll see if my third and final prediction is correct or not.But there is no question that BSG has helped redefine what it is possible to do on a television series.  It has taken narrative to new levels, has introduced a moral and spiritual darkness that surpasses even THE SOPRANOS, and has shown that you can completely redefine an other moribund genre, making Science Fiction that speaks more to adults than the teenagers.  I can't wait for the final ten episodes.Edit -- 1/18/09 -- Well, I was wrong on the final Cylon (if, that is, Tigh is correct).  I was half right in my reasoning.  I was convinced that it couldn't be someone who was with the fleet and that they were most likely dead.  But I was equally confident that they were supporters of Laura Roslin.  To that degree the person currently revealed as the final Cylon doesn't make a lot of sense.  But one of the things about being the executive producers is that things in the end don't have to make a lot of sense.  That said, the Season 4.5 opener was a stunning episode in many, many ways, and further proof of just how great this show is."
"finish a story, and do it well, very rarely. This show did that, and with style, it should be considered the standard."
"Don't miss this series. This is as good as it gets. Strong characters, great fx, plenty of complicated plot. See it."
"With such a strong ending--sad to see one of the best shows end, but thanks for the ride!  If you haven't seen this, watch it from the beginning--you'll be glad you did."
"I've finished watching all four seasons and have tried to figure out what made this series so watchable. I couldn't get enough. The overall plot was basically incomprehensible, there were so many holes and so much illogic that it should have been awful--but it wasn't. I've watched other popular sci-fi shows, and found them blah after a few episodes, the characters one dimensional, the story arc predicatble. I was watching a discussion of the BSG show with Ron Moore, and something he said finally clicked: we learn more from our heroes by their flaws than their virtues. The characters on BSG are VERY flawed--they're just plain wrong a lot, they use their positions for personal purposes, they can't figure out who they really love, they shift allegiances according to what serves the moment--and that makes them immensely intriguing. Is Baltar a saint or a devil? How about Roslin--does the end justify the means? Is Adama a hypocrit? What the frakk is wrong with Starbuck? And how can you not forgive Lee for being such a goody-two shoes when he had come through the battle of the bulge? The scene with Apollo and Starbuck in the ring in priceless--what better way to prove how much you love someone than by knocking their teeth out. Not that anybody's teeth every get knocked out, fortunately. It's one of those seemingly illogical things, that after as many blows to the jaw as they all take, any of them have any front teeth at all. And what's with the way the sixes dress? I mean, really, put some clothes on. The heat can't be all that good in those big drafty ships. So, in sum, all the plot holes and illogical points are so overpowered by the amazing acting and perfect casting and great character development and endless surpises and REALLY BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE ARE that you HAVE to keep watching. When Baltar says things like, ""I never really belonged to you, you appropriated me"" or ""You're right. I wouldn't trust me either"" you want to cheer the writers. The subtlety of that is something few shows can achieve. And then, of course, there's the HUGE pay-off at the end. Not many series can boast that. Most dribble away into some underwhelming resolution that seems to be there just because the show has to end somehow. I REALLY want more--not a prequel. I want to know what happens next--how come only one dna line makes the cut? And really? People as social (or anti-social) as Adama and Chief would choose human isolation? You can't even be anti-social if you don't have something to be anti TO. So please, I wanna know how it all works out for the next 150,000 years...or at least the next 148,000 of them.More, please."
I love the battlestar galactica seasons and this seasons was more spectacular than the last.  Full of action and storylines
"This is one awesome show, each time a eposide ended had to start the next. If you liked the original, you'll love this one."
"I would give it 10 stars if I could. Loved the music, the characters and the plot line. It lasted 4 seasons as it had an end point it was working towards so it couldn't last any longer.It got a bit convoluted at times but pretty much sorted itself out in the end. A few questions were left unanswered in my mind but, oh, well.I had to limit myself to only viewing a few episodes at a ltime or I would have watched them all at once and been lost to my family for a week or two. As it was I watched 3 or 4 in a row. Hated to turn it off to eat or sleep. The background noises of the ship was such an amazing addition. Sort of like watching a move filmed in a submarine. Creaking and groaning. And how solid the  doors to the rooms were, again like the seals in a submarine. Nothing like the flat and sterile scenes of Star Trek.This is not a mans only series. Lots of strong women characers doing things I can only dream of doing and doing better than a man.I'm thinking of putting it on my Chrstmas list for next year.So watch a few episodes yourself and see if you don't get hooked and add the word &#34;frak &#34;to your vocabulary."
"Some spoilers......This show remains as dark, gripping, and challenging as ever.  The Cylon rebels break away from the others, while the humans still struggle with the fact that any one of them could be revealed to be a Cylon--at any time.  The cast gives powerful performances all around, and the revelation to Adama by a certain person was wrenching to watch.  Olmos showed the anguish and shock that any one of us would feel upon learning that a trusted confidante was never a human at all.Richard Hatch, from the original series, is great with his delivery and timing.  He should be given more employment.  James Callis as Baltar leads us into uncharted territory as he becomes a religious cult leader, while Mary McDonnell shows how hard it is to maintain grace and hope while battling cancer.Then they get where they wanted to go, and....oh, I can't tell you, but of course they had to leave us hanging there!"
"After two seasons of slowly developing its character-based drama, ""Battlestar Galactica"" come on strong in Season 3 with more intensity.  The same can be said for this first half of Season 4, as literally every single episode crackles with dramatic development, action, and even philosophy.I won't give away any major spoilers here, but this season begins with the aftermath of the Gaius Baltar (James Callis) trial and the miraculous ""return"" of Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace (Katee Sackhoff).  From there, it also deals with the revelation of four of the final five Cylons (and how they deal with that knowledge), as well as a potential human/cylon alliance in order to find Earth.  There is so much going on this season both plot-wise & character-wise that I could write for paragraphs and still not cover it all!  This set also ends with a cliffhanger that you will NEVER see coming (even if you know it is indeed coming).Again, mirroring what I liked about the third season of this show, the beginning of this effort is just as much about the Cylons as it is about the humans.  To me, the human/Cylon relationship has always been the backbone of this show, and this season gets off to a great start by exploring that relationship in even greater depth.Of course, as per usual, the acting and character drama is also incredible.  Each member of the large ensemble cast is given a juicy role (no one is left out), while the show even proves it can survive for a few episodes without a strong Admiral Adama (Edward James Olmos) presence.  We're talking LOST-like character progression (the highest compliment I can give a TV show).Overall, this beginning half of Season 4 continues the strong BSG tradition of crafting intense, character-driven drama that truly makes you care about the participants.  You might as well have 4.5 ready, because you won't want to wait to see what happens next!"
"Definitely one of the best shows that are around. Love the dry humor and the adaptability of all the heroes. Never saw Donovan before so he was a very pleasant surprise. Gabrielle Anwar is simply wonderful as Fiona - her cheerful bloodthirstiness has something rather innocent in it and thus adds to the general merriment. Sam, Mom and the little brother are also good (the brother is definitely better clean shaved).It would be interesting to see where all the relationships go in the second season - and hope for more!"
"This show is fast paced and fun. I love the ""helping the little guy"" angle and the quick humor in every episode."
Great for background noise. keeps you interested and entertained yet you do not have to sit and watch the whole thing.
"Having watched every episode of Burn Notice, my wife and I, along with several friends and family members, are completely hooked.In a way this show reminds me of another series we thoroughly enjoyed 20 years ago, Stingray. Although Stingray was completely under the radar, and Michael is always blip number one, there are still similarities. Michael's skill at going undercover and improvising a role comes to mind. Also, Stingray's stories were a trade in 'favors', and Michael and friends often help someone as a favor, or for only expenses. Both had secretive but evidently quite successful histories in secret ops.One of the things I enjoy most about Burn Notice are the little 'spy tips' that grace every show. Some of them make sense, some are utter nonsense, and some of them I'm not too sure about, but they're all fun.Another thing I like about it is the way in which the 'bad guys' often come to grief in very satisfying, often funny ways. The late 2nd season episode where Michael foils a bank robbery is hilarious.Whether it makes sense all the time or not, obviously the writers of this show care, and are putting a good effort into each script. That makes up for any sins and makes for a quite entertaining show.Season One obviously contains the ""origin story"" in the pilot, which is a big advantage. However, this series is remarkably consistent throughout its run, and all the episodes are of very consistent quality as well. Although there have been a few stand out shows that I particularly enjoyed, I can't really think of any ""stinkers"" that I had to overlook. USA Network just keeps coming out with many of the most entertaining shows on TV over the last few years, and Burn Notice is part of that group."
"THIS is the series that started it all for our family!  We love the shots of Miami, we love the banter between  'team Michael&#34; and we especially love the 'over voice' as Michael explains what's happening!"
"was fun to watch and my wife and I enjoyed it! What more can I say -- anything rather than watch 643,588 drug commercials between the actual 30 minutes of show. Do all men who watch this have erectile disfunction - that sure seems to be the audience they are targeting."
"Burn Notice - Season OneEnjoyed the series, enjoy it more without the commercials."
"This series has a variety of plots, and the chemistry works well among all the characters.  It is fast moving with a lot of action, yet it keeps its humanity.  The main characters are all fascinating because they've previously been clandestine agents and have many tricks of their trade from which to draw.  The female lead character is very strong and strong-willed with her own mind and actions, which is very refreshing.  She also has a good heart, along with the other 2 male leads, so they find themselves constantly helping other people instead of sticking to their own agendas.  All 3 three main charcters are fearless and capable of extracting themselves from dangerous situations and people.  The violence is not graphic and not overdone.  Recommend Seasons 1 - 4.  Haven't seen 5 yet. Have a good day, everyone."
"loved the first season very, very much, especially Sam.  lots of excitement and intrigue.  this was the very best season"
"This is a great show with a great cast, and it immediately can count itself amongst USA network classics like Monk and MacGyver.  A funny, down to earth intelligence officer/agent has been ""burned""  by his handlers (declared unreliable) and is confined to Miami where he must work under the table as an ""investigator"" while he figures out his situation.  Its not really that deep or ground breaking, but it works as an original series.Caveat, I saw this at the store for 39.99, regular price.  That is too high, don't pay more than what is advertised here.  Show is great, but you only get 11  42 minute episodes and the video quality is mediocre at best.  25.99 is a fair price."
I have been a fan since the first episode. Jeffrey Donovan is a awesome actor . Plus we always looks hot in his suites. I also really like the actor that plays Sam. He is so funny and cute also. If you like action packed shows you gotta see burn notice. There's never a dull moment.
"Jeffrey Donovan has played some really smarmy jerks in some of his previous roles.  It was tough for me to want to watch ""Burn Notice.""  Glad I did.  I really like the show's concept and chemistry of the cast."
"I've often wondered what happened to Sharon Gless after ""Cagney and Lacy"".  Now I know, she's still appearing in top notch serials.Now if Hulu would start running old ""Cagney and Lacy"" episodes."
"I really love this show.  It's one of my 'new' favourites.  To be honest, I first started watching it because of Jeffrey Donovan, who plays the lead, Michael Weston.  I used to watch him in The Pretender and Crossing Jordan and loved him, so I began to see what this was like.  It's a great show and I make sure not to miss any episodes.  Speaking of episodes, this is how season 1 plays out;PILOT - Michael Weston, a contract agent for various agencies including the CIA, finds that a burn notice has been issued for him. Stranded in Miami, he takes the case of a caretaker accused of stealing millions from his boss.IDENTITY - Weston is roped into helping his mother's friend get back money she lost in a scam, but Fi and Sam may ruin everything with their bumbling and bickering.FIGHT OR FLIGHT - Michael's landlord, Oleg, is having a problem with one of his waitresses. She hasn't come into work because she witnessed a crime committed by a man who just happens to be a member of a local drug cartel. Michael is (mostly) happy to look into it, as he also continues his investigation into who stuck him with his burn notice.OLD FRIENDS - Michael's brother is back in town, and he involves him in the search for a friend's daughter for less than pure motives. Elsewhere, an agent with a grudge comes after Michael.FAMILY BUSINESS - Michael takes on arms dealers for an airport worker, while Nate obsesses about the car and their dad's will.UNPAID DEBTS - Michael helps out an old SEAL buddy of Sam's who has gotten himself on the wrong side of a smuggler while trying to repossess his boat, and a new agent hits town set on making Michael's life miserable since he won't give up on finding his burn notice.BROKEN RULES - Michael works to rid a community in little Havana of a crime boss, all the while baiting Jason Bly at the risk of his family and friends.WANTED MAN - Fiona decides to try bounty-hunting, but then convinces Michael to help prove the man innocent.HARD BARGAIN - A slightly dim house sitter's fianc&eacute;e has been kidnapped, and Sam guilts Michael into a rescue while he's negotiating with a D.C. bureaucrat to stop the burn notice.FALSE FLAG - Michael makes plans to leave Miami, but has to do one last job - locate a woman's missing son - so he can get a new identity.LOOSE ENDS PART 1 - Phillip Cowan has arrived in Miami, but Michael has to put him off when a job involving heroin and blackmail goes south.LOOSE ENDS PART 2 - With Cowan's bosses now tracking him, Michael must protect his family and rescue Sam all before his own capture if he doesn't move fast enough.To elaborate just that little bit more, a 'burn notice' is when a spy is cut off, no jobs, nothing.  Jeffrey Donovan is great in this and so is Gabrielle Anwar and the writing for this series is sharp.  I was hooked from the first episode and I'm sure you'll be too.  It's brilliant and I highly recommend it."
"My son got me watching this show and boy are they addictive.  We can watch 5-6 shows at a time.  The plots seem quite original.  Never a dull moment.  Love the characters.  Am trying to figure out what makes these so entertaining--original plots, realistic and unusual lead characters, pretty scenery, the narration--they educate the viewer about spy stuff while they entertain.  I think that's what sets them apart--the aspect of educating about spy work.  The humor is fun, too.  They're upbeat but not silly. The violence doesn't seem heavy.  You're happy to see the bad guys get their due.  A fresh, original series!"
"One of the biggest advantages to come of with the dawn of the DVD age is that television shows that might otherwise have gone unnoticed have been given a new chance at life with the release of series seasons on disc. Such is the case with BURN NOTICE, a fairly moderate hit on cable that has the chance to gain viewers with the release this week of season one on disc.The story revolves around Michael Weston (Jeffrey Donovan), perhaps the best spy the US has. The problem begins when right in the middle of a transaction with foreign operatives, Weston is given his ""burn notice"". In effect, a burn notice is a termination of current employment where an agent is left in the field without identity, backup, funds or anything that might help him. Happening in the middle of an illegal transaction with killers is not the best time to be notified.Weston escapes and lands in Miami. Using his knowledge and special ops skills, he sets up a place to stay, contacts his old friend Sam (Bruce Campbell) who helps set him up with some work. He also meets up with past girlfriend Fiona (Gabrielle Anwar) - an ex-IRA bomber that he left behind, and his mother (Sharon Gless), a chain smoking retiree.Things are not the best he could hope for.The character of Michael Weston is charismatic and yet hard at the same time. He has difficulty relating to what you and I might think of as normal civilians. Put him in the midst of a group of soldiers discussing weapons and explosives and he's in his element. Sitting next to a young boy whose father has been threatened by a rich employer who has set him up to take the fall for a fake theft and that's a whole different ballgame. As played by Donovan, the character is believable and easy on the eyes for female fans.Most of the episodes consist of two stories running side by side. The ongoing story consists of Michael trying to discover who issued his burn notice so he can go back to doing what he does best. Whoever placed him there has let him know in no uncertain terms that he is to remain in Miami and let it go. FBI agents that follow him around, NSA members who visit him and more attempt to get that through his head. But Michael doesn't choose to take this situation lying down.The second storylines involve Michael either being recruited to help someone in need or taking on jobs that his friend Sam puts him in contact with. Anything from a kidnapping to the fake theft mentioned above requires him to use his cunning and skills to help someone in need.What I thought made this series work more than anything was the interplay between characters. Not only that but the casting choices make this work like a Swiss watch. Each actor has his or her piece to play and they do it to perfection.Campbell has found his niche here playing the friend who was once involved in covert actions as well. Sam not only helps Michael but feeds information (usually false) to the Feds who keep an eye on Michael.Fiona as played by Anwar offers an elegant looking woman with tremendous sex appeal but who has a deadly side that she lets loose now and then. Even then she offers some of the most humorous lines in the show as she matter of factly considers eliminating anyone who gives Michael trouble. This let's kill `em attitude coming from this petite woman makes for an interesting character.The series offers plenty of action, lots of thoughtful plotlines, a ton of subtle humor and even a touch of romance. With the second season getting ready to begin this summer, now is the time to pick up season one and get caught up. The cliffhanger at season's end will be a great jumping on point this summer. Until then, give this DVD release a try. It's worthy of adding to any collection."
"amazingly unique series.  great views of miami and lots of laughs and gaffes.  jeffrey donovan has come into his own in this series with help from great actors like bruce campbell, gabrielle anwar, and sharon gless."
"I love everything about burn notice - the idea of a cast out spy, living in Miami, doing odd-job MacGyver -type work for the fun of it and to help &#34;innocent&#34; people. it's fun; it's full of action and J. Donovan is fun to watch."
"This is one of the best series ever.  I love the way he explains what he is doing.  Not fond of the brother character, though.  Bruce Campbell reminds me how much I loved Brisco County and I have been watching that with great joy."
"The first season, particularly the pilot, just drew me in.  Good pacing, good plotting, interesting characters and plausible situations. The later seasons get a little bit more complicated (situations, plots, and premises) and I sometimes get tired with trying to keep up with what's going on, nod off and fall asleep.  But the first season, yeah, 5 stars!"
"Michael Westen, with his distinctive droll humor and mellow charm is an endlessly fun character.  His way of being placidly befuddled by all things female is a great counter to his spy smarts.  Donovan fits the role so perfectly it is as though the series was written for him.The plots are light and fast blends of stuff - CIA operative spy stuff, Miami lowlife stuff, romantic stuff, family stuff, and other stuff.  Fi is perfectly Fi - her pretty, petite, and generally nearly naked self, loving to blow things up and so very eager to shoot anything that moves.  Michael takes Fi home to have dinner with mom, and Fi turns into the sweet and innocent ""girl next door"" - laugh out loud funny.  The somewhat slovenly and slightly alcoholic Sam, a womanizer (but not in the typical misogynistic way) adds just the right presence.  Madeline round out the fine core quartet.Only one thing marred my otherwise unqualified enthusiasm for Burn Notice. Mom Madeline's chain smoking.  Watching someone smoke is about the same as watching someone barf - flat out nauseating. And it generates two obvious flaws in the character -- Madeline's beautiful complexion and her sparkling white teeth -- no chain-smoker has either of those.  Not that the series is meant to be realistic - no appeal in that!  But if Madeline were scripted with an interesting addiction or predilection, rather than this dull and repulsive one, the role could have been enhanced.  So many opportunities lost!As one of the other reviewers noted, Michael is eminently quotable: ""Duct tape makes you smart.""  Ahhh ...... The Westen Wisdom."
"The movie has many moments from happy to sad.............also loved the story line.  Of course, Donald Sutherland is a fantastic actor.  I was surprised as I did not know what to expect.  Very entertaining!  Held my interest all the way.  Definitely recommend."
"At first I thought it was going to be a corny love comedy but as the movie continued, it kept me interested. The cast is great. Every one is going through something and money plays a big factor for some. There is drama, comedy, and love. The story between mother and son is beautiful and though her mother was not the best mother, her son has a huge heart for integrity and loyalty. Truly enjoyed it."
"This movie is outstanding!  It's intense, and terrible things happen, but the story and the actors are all amazing.  I've been wanting to see Anton Yelchin in something else ever since seeing him in ""Taken"", and I was really impressed by his role in this film.  I also wanted to see Kristen Stewart in something else, and I watched this one and another one she was in, and I'm extremely impressed with her.  I expected another Bella, but in both movies, she was totally different. I don't know what it is, how some actors can be so many different characters so convincingly.  some are basically the same all the time, but not these two extremely fine actors! Everyone in this movie played their roles to perfection, and I highly recommend it."
"I cannot believe I missed it when it was first showing, but I am also kinda glad because now I can see it all at once. It is a little (well, a lot) racier than my taste allows but the story line and the characters and the DRAMA!!!!!. totally ADDICTED."
it's got a lote going 4 it. cursing very tasteless humor. it's a more human swing of parts 4 dave compared to moulder . puss the most important to me NAKED LADIES and a few big named stares. only thing missing is graphic violence
If there was ever a sequel to catcher in the rye... this would be it. The humor is witty and sharp plot twists abound and there are many belly laughs thrown in. Binge watch it!
"Like HBO's ""Deadwood"" series, ""Californication"" defies viewers to look beyond the obvious, coarse provocations that frame the show and look into the souls of its characters. In this case, it's egregious swearing, brazen sexuality and occasional drug use that are thrown at the audience, in this rough-and-tumble portrait of Hank Moody, a bad-boy boho novelist who's made it to Hollywood only to lose his moral compass, and his marriage as well.Although the Moody character seems a little forced -- he's a two-fisted, heavy drinking thinking man's roughneck who sleeps with any gal that pauses long enough to make eye contact -- actor David Duchovny invests the character with unexpected nuances and depth, and turns in a fine performance all around. Indeed, viewers like myself, who thought he was kind of a dud as Agent Mulder (in ""The X-Files"") will be pleasantly surprised to find what a clever, funny performer he actually can be. Likewise, this show will sweep you up and ensnare you in its ribald humor, jaw-dropping outrageousness and intelligent writing. There's great dialog, plenty of hot monkey love, a de rigeur skewering of vapid LA culture, and a delicious, fast-paced soap opera scandal that will get you squirming in your seat. Yummy fun! (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)"
"This show is bordering on pornography.  There is a lot of sex, drug use, profanity and some nudity.  Some of it leaves me with my jaw hanging but it is very witty and funny, so I enjoy it.  Definitely not recommended for children, holy rollers or people who just can't handle this type of content."
"I dont get Showtime so the only time I got to see this series was when they were running a promo over a weekend and I finally got to see the show. I ll be honest, I had no interest in the show. It sounded like yet another 'risque' show and it didnt sound that interesting but I was wrong. I caught the last ten minutes of an episode and that was more than enough. I went to iTunes and one by one, I bought the entire first season. Yes, it is very honest and holds no punches and has tons of sex but it is also the best written show ive seen this past year. It is never dull and has some very shocking, and hilarious, moments throughout. This is strictly for adults, though, and that is no exaggeration.I would give Emmys to the show, to Duchovny, to McElhone (who recently lost her husband, my sympathies to her and her family) and the writers and some supporting nods.If you dont mind frank talk, then you will love this show."
"DIalog (writing) setting and plot execution, acting and more make this a stand-out series.  The mix of human-realities insights with humor just works.  it feels real.  It IS fun.  This is just great television"
"CALIFORNICTION is a really good series I missed when it was on TV.  Now on disc don't miss this great series, season four is just about to arrive.  A notable writer with writer's block, besides being a womanizing drunk, it is all for this man who is really deeply in love with his wife and daughter. Follow this very funny adult series.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
"Californication is a very fun, wild, and inventive show. In someways it feels like a highbrow entourage minus the literal entourage. The main character, Hank Moody, is a wild bad boy writer whose fun times usually lead him into some sticky situations. There is a solid balance between love, laughter, and over the top situations. At several times you will find yourself wanting to be in Hank's shoes and other times so glad you live a relatively benign life. A very fun watch and i would recommend it to anyone that does not mind excessive profanity and at times nudity."
"It took me a few episodes to warm up to ""Californication."" At first I wasn't quite sure what the show was trying to be...maybe ""Sex and the City"" for men? But it's actually much more than that. The show revolves around Hank Moody (David Duchovny), an author who's been in a bit of a writer's slump ever since his last novel was published seven years ago. Hank longs to return to his hometown of New York City, but remains in California because his former lover, Karen (Natascha McElhone), lives there, along with their teenage daughter, Becca (Madeleine Martin). Hank is still very much in love with Karen, and it's pretty obvious that she still loves him, too. Unfortunately, Karen's engaged to stuffy Bill (Damian Young), and Hank unwittingly has sex with Bill's 16-year-old daughter, Mia (Madeline Zima), who eventually ends up blackmailing Hank and trying to take credit for his latest manuscript. What a mess!""Californication"" also boasts a strong supporting cast. Evan Handler plays Hank's best friend and agent, Charlie. Poor Charlie and his wife, Marcy (Pamela Adlon), experience some problems in the bedroom that lead to both of them cheating on each other with Charlie's hot young assistant, Danni (Rachel Miner). Handler and Adlon are amazingly funny on screen, and they play off each other very well: They're the funniest television couple since Lucy and Ricky Ricardo!By far, the best thing about this show is its sense of humor. There are some incredibly funny scenes in ""Californication"" that definitely are among the most hilarious moments in TV history, and that's saying a lot. From Hank throwing up on Bill's priceless painting to the office dominatrix scenes to the three-way/orgy culmination, there are plenty of great scenes to go around. I don't remember the last time a TV show made me laugh so hard.The first four or five episodes of the show were a little bumpy, but then ""Californication"" evolved into a great program about love, relationships, and self-discovery. The entire cast is brilliant, and most of the episodes are incredibly touching. I especially loved the last scene of the final episode, which came as a complete surprise and resulted in a very happy ending, at least for now.Overall, ""Californication"" is a surprising success. I can't wait for the second season."
"I REALLY WAS A BIT SHOCKED, ESPECIALLY FOR SOMETHING YOU CAN WATCH ON TV, THAT BEING SAID, I ENJOYED BEING ENTERTAINED AND ALL OF THE ""SEX TALK"" WAS NEW AND DIFFERENT, SHOCKING, AND I LOVED IT...I HAVE A MAJOR CRUSH ON DAVID AND THAT'S ALWAYS A PLUS...TO HAVE THE ""HOTS"" FOR THE STAR OF THE SHOW...SERIOUSLY, THE WRITING AND THE WRITERS ARE SECOND TO NONE...IT MOVES RIGHT ALONG AND IS NEVER BORING AND THE SUBJECT MATTER IS ALWAYS SHOCKING AND SLEAZY AND ENTERTAINING, TO SAY THE LEAST, TO SAY THE MOST, I AM NOW ADDICTED TO THE SHOWS....AND WILL EVENTUALLY OWN THEM, ONE SEASON AT A TIME !!!!SMOKING POT, GETTING HIGH, THE SEX SCENES ARE THE BEST AND JUST TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY DO TO ONE ANOTHER AND FOR ONE ANOTHER IS A NEW EXPERIENCE FOR ME...I AM SORRY THAT I MISSED THE SERIES WHEN IT STARTED...HOWEVER, NOW I OWN THEM VIA MY VIDEO LIBRARY, SO I CAN KEEP THEM AND ENJOY THEM ANYTIME THAT I AM IN THE MOOD TO WATCH THEM AND ENJOY THEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN."
"Series these days are usually careful and stupid.  Careful not to be profane, sexual, bitingly funny and self deprecating.  Stupid because money usually rolls down to the lowest common denominator of humanity.  Most series are terrified of being labeled that most ugly of all adjectives, intellectual.  This series is smart and wide frigging open.  It will run your slow a$$ over if you don't watch out and make you laugh at the tire tracks on your forehead... this is the stuff Lenny Bruce would have written if he were alive.You don't like it?  There are a million other stupid and careful shows for you to watch.  Later."
"In the wasteland that is television and most ""entertainment media"" there are fewer and fewer really shining stars.  We are left with two masterpieces of darkly comedic drama.  Dexter is one and deserves its own review.Breaking Bad is the apex of adrenaline-pumping cliff-hangers, with every real-life adventure possible built in.  It outshines and pales anything else on TV, with the exception of Dexter.Breaking Bad is built on a plausability-factor that works in the real world, if at its most extreme.It laces the most perfect syncronicity into every plot and each and every plot realates to each and every previous as well, no doubt, as all plots to come.I end every episode recovering my breath and uttering ""My God, that was good!""If they were to produce 26, or even 52 episodes per season, it wouldn't be enough.  Vince Gilligan, Bryan Cranston and their wonderful cast tear my heart out, make me furious, and leave me feeling compassion for the most flawed group of characters imaginable with every episode...Though fewer, as the series intensifies, there are also incredible laughs to be found.Breaking Bad is life lived on levels none of us can imagine for ourselves, but know, could happen to any of us with one wrong turn or one cruel twist of fate.Bravo to a true masterpiece of entertainment!  I am in awe of a perfect work in the making.If you have not watched Breaking Bad from the beginning, it is the only place to start.  Buy season one, and just keep going!  You will have no regrets, and you will experience the very best any media has to offer in truly imaginative entertainment."
this series is fantastic Bryan Cranston freaking rules this series. Its wild entertaining i must watch for any tv series watcher out there this series delivers the goods never letting down.
"Here we have the first season of BREAKING BAD.  It is amazing to realize that it is only 7 episodes for the character, plot and drama development is so thorough and realistic another show would need at least double the episodes to achieve it.  The basic plot is a teacher who finds out he is dying of cancer and thru unexpected situations gets the opportunity to make a great deal of money thru manufacturing meth.  He does so to make money for his family to be able to live on after he dies.  But the show is about so much more than this.  Every character is addicted to something and the introduction into the dark world of drugs is terrifyingly realistic.  This is honestly one of the best shows ever to air on television.  It tells a story that may be too dark for some to handle but the superb acting, writing and directing make it all work.  These characters are all believable, necessary and the intertwining of their lives is seamless.The show also succesfully combines deep psychological profiles of each character mixed with the heavy, often disturbing drama.  And the plot always serves a purpose, is realistic no matter how heavy, and is in no way gratuituous.  And with this show we also get one of the best duos ever in Walt and Jesse.  When Jesse, Aaron Paul, a former student of Walt, Bryan Cranston, joins him in the making of meth a perfect chemistry is formed.  BREAKING BAD also provides the occasional comic break that helps alleviate the heavy drama.  This series is a must for its great acting, superb writing and directing and totally unique premise.  If it sounds like any other series you have seen believe me when I say it is not.  The blu ray of course adds a dimension to the series over that of the dvd.  There are many dark scenes but the detail and clarity still shines thru and the scenes with color and specifically the lovely scenery shots pop off the screen.  Audio is superb.  This is  a series that is dialogue driven but when the action sequences happen nothing is held back.  This series is superb and I highly recommend it."
"Outstanding 1st season!I loved this show!Brian Cranston was hands down ""phenomenal"" as Walter White and easily deserved his Emmy. Aaron Paul is awesome in his role as Jesse Pinkman, and all the other cast members seemed to be a perfect fit.I knew the show was good, because of all the rave reviews, but I was'nt expecting it to be this good! ""Breaking Bad"" Season 1 has a 5 star overall rating here on Amazon.Great writing, great timing and development of the characters. The storyline is dramatic, hilarious and keeps you watching. Just when you think the story is starting to slow down, they nail you with something big!I watch alot of TV seasons on DVD (The Shield, CSI, Rescue Me), because I work at night. I haven't seen a show in its 1st season that was this good, since ""Dexter Sea. 1""!The only bad part about this show, was that the 1st season was only 7 episodes! Looking forward to the next season already!Highly, highly recommended!"
"This is the second of two AMC series I went to catch up with, because this and ""Mad Men"" were constantly winning awards, and my favorites were being left in the dust. Both series had a hurdle for me. How can I possibly empathize with a meth manufacturer and dealer (the two lead roles). As it turns out, the story line is so inventive and so believable that it is hard not be be drawn into the perils of these characters which are so totally under water. The story on the face of it is so tense, that the show's creator had to add to the premise the fact that the brother in law of the Walter White (Brian Cranston) is a lead DEA agent, and, in most regards, a pretty good one. Perhaps one of the only improbabilites of the first season is that this DEA agent comes so close to gathering evidence which implicates Walter, but he doesn't catch on.Perhaps the most compelling aspect of the story is seeing the extent to which people will do totally out of character things, things which are not only illegal (as one may think about drug business as a victimless crime), but violently illegal, including multiple murders. The acting by Cranston and Brian Paul, his ""dealer"" is superb, worthy of their Emmy wins. I must also give a good word for Raymond Cruz, who does a character far, far different from his police detective role on ""The Closer / Major Crimes"". The tension between his character Tuco and Walter White holds one's attention like little I've seen elsewhere.This is not for everyone, but watching one or two episodes shows why this one wins awards, and shows such as ""White Collar"", ""Royal Pains"", and ""Suits"" do not."
Breaking hilarious!  This is one occasion where all the hype is true.  Endearing characters you want to love and hate at the same time.  Situational comedy with a twist.
at least for me it isn'ti was sorry that season one was cut short by the writers. THIS is what TV should be like. i loved it and am a devoted fan now.Can't wait for season three on Blu Ray
"I think many, when looking at the main star of this show (Bryan Cranston) will have only really been familiar with him from Malcolm In The Middle. He played Hal, a simple Dad with simple values and an unbeatable love for his family. Who would have thought that he can take a character with the same basic love of his family and create something incredibly unique from that. In Breaking Bad, Bryan Cranston plays Chemistry professor Walter White who's married with a handicap son who suffers from Cerebral Palsy and a child on the way.One day Walter is hit with the ultimate bombshell as he finds he has inoperable lung cancer and has little time left to live. Walter realises that he can't assure his families financial security for the little time he has left being a teacher. He hears about a raid on a crystal meth lab that seizes millions of dollars worth of drugs which he decides that he must be a part of that. He knows how to make the best crystal meth ever seen, but not how to get it on the streets which is why he must enlist the help of his former student and drug pusher Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul).I honestly didn't have high hopes for this show as, although I'm a huge fan of Bryan Cranston for his work on Malcolm In The Middle, I struggled to believe he could pull off such a train wreck of a character. The family is a typical middle class American family struggling to take care of their disabled son trying to make him have as normal a life as possible. In a way I can relate to the situation as I'm disabled myself and know how much of a strain it can be on parents. Sure, it's not the same disability, but the family struggling through it is definitely displayed well and R.J. Mitte as Walter Jr. is an excellent fit. Although I'm betting he was only cast because he too has Cerebral Palsy, he still fits the bill and plays the character brilliantly.Fantastic, fantastic show. I don't want to tell you much about the seasons events as it is quite short and risks spoiling certain events. I have to tell you that there are times in which this show doesn't hold back. It has no qualms about showing you the brutality of a broken man fighting against his own sense of morality, joining the drug world and even dealing with the fact that he killed a guy. Oh and obviously he's dying and is reminded of that from time to time but it's certainly gelled together brilliantly.Just to wrap it up I can only really say this TV show is amazing in every way and I would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. Bryan Cranston is a very underrated actor, but he's determined to prove himself for which he does a terrific job. When this DVD set comes out in the UK I'll certainly be one of the first to buy it."
"The scenes, interviews and explanations made this series intriguing.  I'd like to see the show based on this introduction and feel that I understood why it is so popular."
"What a provocative show.  From the pilot forward this has been an addiction to me.  Everything about this show is outstanding, the acting, the writing, the photography, everything.There's nothing like this show.  Some of the finest television I've ever seen."
The first episode will confuse and make you question just what is going on. It is a little slow at times but there is a lot of set up for the second season which is just unreal. It's a dark show but it is awesome.
"Dark, gripping and unique!Emmy Award winner Bryan Cranston plays the role of Walter White, a chemistry teacher at a local high school trying make ends meet for his family. His wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) is pregnant and his son Walter White Jr. (RJ Mitte) is physically challenged.  The family are struggling financially and behind on bills.Walter tries to provide for his family by working two jobs.  He is a very intelligent chemist that can probably work anywhere and make a lot of money but yet he teaches chemistry to high school students (who have no care in chemistry) and then having to work part time at a car wash in which his students mock him for it.  To make matters worse, Walter has just discovered that he has inoperable lung cancer.Knowing that his family has no money, he doesn't tell his family about it.  In fact, he keeps the cancer to himself and with all the crap going in his life, this is the last thing he needs.Depressed and just out of it, he is surprised that his wife has a surprise 50th birthday party with all his friends and his family (with their friends).  He watches his sister-in-law Marie's boyfriend Hank (Dean Norris) is a DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) agent on television and how he goes after the notorious drug dealers in New Mexico and has been successful. Always finding a way to poke fun at Walter's weakness, he offers Walter a chance to go on a DEA ride-along as they go after drug dealers.  But what catches Walter's eye is the discussion of how much money is made by these drug dealers.So, Walter decides one day to take on Hank's offer to  go on a ride along for a crystal meth bust.  He sees how chemistry is applied to crystal meth, how it's developed in their labs and how these drug dealers are making really crappy products.  With basic chemistry, he can cook the finest crystal meth and possibly make some money for him and his family.So, during the bust, he sees a former student named Jesse Pinkman escaping from the area of the drug bust.  Walter goes to Jesse's residence after the busts and tells him that he wants to join forces with him.  He'll create the best crystal meth using his intelligent chemist skills and Jesse finds a way to make money.In an unlikely collaboration, both Walter and Jesse begin to work with each other.  But because Walter's crystal meth is perfect, Jesse's distributor want to know who's cooking it.  Thus they go to where Walter is cooking and threaten the both of them. In trouble, Walter uses his chemistry skills to create a cloud of poison and thus killing the drug dealers.Caught up in a botched up drug deal, both Walter and Jesse have now crossed the line and now have murdered one and keeping the other captive in the basement of Jesse's home.Walter goes from a ho-hum life to a criminal life involving drugs, theft and murder.  And because he needs money badly, he gets him and Jesse farther into criminal territory with ruthless drug dealers.  Meanwhile, his sister-in-law's DEA boyfriend is on the hunt for the person creating the perfect crystal meth.The first season of ""BREAKING BAD"" features a total of seven episodes.

An intelligent discussion among professionals.* Screen Tests - The actual screen tests for Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Betsy Brandt and Dean Norris.* Breaking Bad on AMC - The AMC commercial for ""Breaking Bad""JUDGMENT CALL:What an excellent series ""BREAKING BAD"" turned out to be.  I was really impressed by the Vince Gilligan's writing and the talent of Bryan Cranston (who won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for ""BREAKING BAD"") in such a demanding role.I have to admit that I was a bit hesitant about watching the series because I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch a television series that may glorify crystal meth and it's good to know that the series doesn't.In fact, it's more about a television series about a very intelligent man making a very stupid decision that will eventually take him to the lowest of lows in order to make money for his family and his treatment.It's so shocking that Walter H. White forgoes working at a great company in order to utilize his talent towards creating crystal meth and getting him involved with the unthinkable and commiting certain heinous acts that you are just shocked.And that is what is so impressive with ""BREAKING BAD"" is that it's a series that is well-written, smart but dark, shocking and even disturbing at times.  And what helps break from the typical dark and depressing storylines is the other characters and the chemistry these characters have with the main character of Walter White.Anna Gunn as Skyler White, a loving wife, mother and sister other does an excellent job of playing a character with so many layers.  In one scene, she may be the concerned housewife and then another scene, the sultry wife who wants to make love to her husband.Then you have Walter's chemistry with the drug dealer Jesse.  Two unlikely people who would never be together in society but now having to work with each other in making money and despite the viewer feeling empathy for Walter because of his health condition and trying to make ends meet for his family, you can foresee nothing but darkness as both Walter and Jesse continue the downward spiral of working in the criminal underground.You see Walter eventually understanding that he put himself in a terrible position.  Having to work with unstable drug dealers, watching Jesse getting beaten and bloodied and even these two having to get involved in various criminal activities.This is not a television series glorifying drugs, it's a series that shows the seedy, dark and gritty criminal underground and things are not all rosy.  I was shocked about the developments that happen in the series which I rather not spoil for the viewer but you have to watch and see for yourself.  Definitely many twists and turns in this television series.Overall, ""BREAKING BAD"" is a unique, well-written and well-acted television series.  Surprisingly, AMC of all cable networks to showcase two exceptional dramatic series (the other is ""MADMEN"") is impressive and you can only think of how far this series will go.  The first season for ""BREAKING BAD"" really was surprising, entertaining and unique.  I was very impressed and looking back, I'm still quite shocked about a few certain scenes.An excellent television series thus far and I look forward in the upcoming twists and turns for the second season.  ""BREAKING BAD - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON"" is definitely recommended!"
"Missed the shows when they started and began to catch up with the season videos.  Up to season 6 now and we agree, it is one of the best shows ever produced for TV."
"I cant wait to see and buy the 5th season. We watched and bought all 4, and sold them, the day after we watched them, instantly. This is what tv and entertainment should be like and isnt! The acting is superb! The characters amazing and believable! they take something that I didnt think Id be interested in and just made it real, even though, it is is so unbelievable, but you KNOW and love or hate all of the characters, and the love and hate changes and is soooooooooo believable! Cudos to these guys, for real!"
"It is like Weeds and Dexter gave birth to one bad @$$ little kid. It says something about today's standards of life when a meth head and a chemist can engage a powerful range of personal growth. There's probably a good joke in that line....But the cook gets burned and finds out he has lung cancer. What's a guy to do when he has a family that depends on him, even after he's gone? Not even the Writer's Strike can get in the way of this train. It's bad. Very bad. And that's good.Why is it that we gravitate towards those who, twenty years ago, who have been abhorrent and never even considered to be 'art' in the media sense of the word. And I guess it says something else about our world today when we've realized not every bad guy is indeed a bad guy. Progressive or the way of the High Road?Whatever. That's all philosophy. Skip the musings and watch a few episodes of this award-winning series. First sampler is one me...."
"""Mad Men"" is great and I've watched three seasons of it, but ""Breaking Bad"" is phenomenal (and I've only just gotten started).  In fact, this could be one of the best shows ever.  Seven fantastic episodes kicked off by the pilot-to-end-all-pilots.  The only lull in the season is when Walter White's family has a long intervention with him about why he doesn't want to get chemotherapy.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad scene, but it's blown away by every other scene in the show.  Bryan Cranston does a great job, as usual."
Season one. Great TV. This is selling at a really good price now. I bought it for a friend who does not have netflix.
"My family was addicted from the first episode!  The writing is so clever, crisp and unique.  The acting catches you up and doesn't let you go.  We would sit down saying that we were only going to watch one episode and end up watching three!  Time flies by and you are completely caught up in a story about an over-qualified high school chemistry teacher who gets a death sentence (lung cancer) and decides to cook and sell meth to make enough money to provide for his pregnant wife and his 15 year-old son who has muscular dystrophy.  When I heard that description of this series, I was under-whelmed and avoided watching it until the final season was set to begin...but my daughter talked us into it.  THANK GOODNESS SHE DID!  It is one of the BEST series I've ever seen on TV.  I highly recommend it!"
"I heard about Breaking Bad (BrBa) through word of mouth, and by the time season 4 was underway I picked up the first season, late on the bandwagon but still wowed. All of the seasons of BrBa are great, but they all sort of drag out what's going on, and while the tension and suspense are there I still have a hard time remembering each episode because a lot of them left me with blue balls. This season however short it is, moved at a lightning quick pace and barely gave me time to adjust my face.Breaking Bad's first season shows the beginning of Walt's transformation from unlucky high school chemist to criminal mastermind, and it's all fascinating because it's all circumstantial, Walt's almost forced into this new dangerous world because the other options are die and leave his family with nothing, and that's what makes BrBa different from say, Scarface since Tony was just a greedy thug in the first place, Walt is a family man.Basically season 1 chronicles Walt taking out his competition early on in New Mexico, and there are many memorable scenes and results from it, one of my favorite moments is Walter putting a plate back together and making a horrible discovery, you know the one. But pretty much episode after episode some new variable changes the game completely, keeping the whole season short and sweet; television writers take note.If you haven't seen BrBa before and are curious you need to stop reading this right now and get your hands on the whole series, season 1 especially starts out the show with a bang but by season 3 it starts to show it's stretch marks. Still Breaking Bad is proof that HBO has some competition."
"Bryan Cranston is absolutely amazing as Walter White, a loving family man stricken with terminal cancer. In a desperate attempt to provide financial security for his family, the chemistry teacher joins forces with a former student Jesse to make the best quality meth lab around.This is a very stylized story driven by the number of odd and quirky characters that surround Walter. His pregnant wife Skyler knows Walter has a secret but what could it be? Add in Walter's streetwise brother-in-law who is a DEA agent, and there is quite a story here.Jesse, the low level drug dealer, and conservative and proper Walter become allies and unwilling friends in a world of violence and murder. Somehow a story about two drug dealers becomes a fascinating study of human nature and a fight between good and bad. Meth dealers as heroes of a show? Somehow it works mainly because we only see the ""bad"" guys in this scenario - not the addicted buyers of the meth.Be ready for a high level of violence. Somehow Walter and Jesse stay ahead of the law and fellow drug dealers. A simple idea to make money becomes a life-threatening career that probably can only end in disaster and destruction.The writing is incredible as we follow the twists and turns of Walter's life. The obvious is never what it seems and somehow we believe it all and crave for more.Cranston is at his absolute best as the cancer-striken chemistry teacher in for the fight of his life on many levels. Cranston's appearance and demeanor changes as he progresses through chemo and his new life as a criminal.It's all absolutely amazing."
"I'll have to admit, after seeing Mad Men (and just about everything HBO and Showtime had to offer) I was pretty much convinced that there was nothing else worth watching on TV..... happy to be proven wrong.You've probably heard all the hype surrounding Breaking Bad and know about it's premise (dying chemestry teacher becomes Meth dealer to support his family). While this sounded interesting,  I wasn't too impressed....that is until I actually saw the first episode.You already know about the great performances, dark humor (Walt-the main character going from timid to fearless) and gritty scenes of drug dealing, but what really sold me on this show was it's honesty. Not just the characters but of how their situations play out and how everything they do effects the world around them.If I had one problem with the show, it's that it's first season is so short. But honestly I'd rather have seven outstanding episodes than a handful of filler between them.This DVD set also has some great commentaries and interviews. I'm very impressed with how much the actors and producers of the show believe in the project and want to see it succeed.I won't pretend that this series is everyone's cup of tea, but if you dig the first episode you'll be in for one of the wildest rides of your life."
"I already owned the series from a few years ago. A friend mentioned she wanted to see it. I gave it to her as a Christmas present. She texted back that they &#34;binge&#34; watched it all the way through. I can't speak to the technical quality, but I assume it was fine because she didn't mention it."
"I got into this show late in the game, as it was heading into its final episodes to be exact.  After watching hours of the AMC marathon leading up to the finale, I couldn't resist picking up the first couple seasons on DVD.  First off, I'm glad I went with the DVD, which is uncensored, as opposed to instant video, which I've read over and over is not.  Watching the show uncensored makes for a more authentic, cinematic viewing experience.  The first season only has 7 episodes, so it's sort of the introduction to the crumbling world of Walter White.  I don't see how anyone who watches the first two or three episodes can avoid being hopelessly hooked by this superbly written and acted, genre-blending show.  ""Breaking Bad"" mixes elements of drama, action, thrillers, and even Westerns, and adds bits of dark comedy in presenting a unique,thoroughly entertaining story.  Full of shocking twists, it never fails to drop my jaw with something completely unexpected.  It's an addictive show I can't seem to get enough of."
"If you haven't started this show, then I feel sorry for you. It's so, so good. I don't want to give anything away. I think you need to just buy this DVD, ship it prime and when it arrives, take the day off of work and watch the first season. When you're done do the same thing with Season 2, etc. until you're caught up. You can thank me later."
"After I completed watching The Sopranos I was in need for a new show to watch. Multiple friends, coworkers, and family members of mine Reccomended this too me, because I'm a fan of Bryan Cranston I thought id give it a try. I ordered it on a Tuesday and it was here by Thursday! I got a chance to watch the first episode of it on Friday, I started watching the show at 7:00pm, the pilot was good, so I watched the next, the next, the next, I looked at the clock, it was 12:30am!  I watched the whole 7 episode season in one night! I just finished watching all seasons and im currently waiting for the final 8 episodes in August 2013. If you thought this seasons wasn't that good, still stick with it because each season gets more darker and better."
"By now there really isn't a whole lot more to be said here. Some people object to the subject matter or Walter White's moral choices, but then that's largely the point, isn't it? As I sit here waiting for the final season to unfold in another week, I look at the cover to the Season One set and think about the Walter White that was. To have managed such an evolution in the central character of a television program in the manner it was done is a remarkable feat -- unprecedented, really. There's a lot to object to here in a moral and ethical sense, but as a fictional meditation on the nature of those choices -- and that's in large part what fiction is about anyway -- Breaking Bad is hard to beat. Everything comes together so well: Acting, production, writing. This is one of the great works of the screen, big or small. Highly recommended."
Now many of you may be thinking the same thing and I don'tblame you at all. The mere mention of the fact has long helda power seldom used for anything. Again thanks.
"This first season is fantastic.  There are definitely relationship scenes that are skip-worthy, but the story feels original, and interesting. The young guy is dumb, but that's ok, we all know a few dumbies in real life.  The following seasons are OK, but the first season really shines."
Best show on Tv.  You never know what might happen on this show. There's always a good twist on every episode.
Teachers do the most interesting things these days and teaching doesn't seem to be one of them.  Breaking Bad is an about a Chemistry Teacher who learns he has lung cancer.  He wavers on treatment but doesn't waiver on learning a new line of work to help his family after he is gone.  It's called drug dealing and he makes crystal meth.  He even enlists a former student and high school dropout to help him in his new endeavor.  The show is absorbing and very interesting.  It is low key and not showy but doesn't hesitate to see humor in the man's predicament.  His wife is pregnant with their second child.  Their first child has cerebral palsy.  His sister in law is a shop lifter married to a fervent DEA agent.  The dropout he ignored in school now becomes his favorite pupil.  So much for role models.  Good show with a lot going for it.
"I was hooked the moment this started and I met the lead characters, Mr. White is great, Jesse is adorable, Hank is hilarious the kids and a wifes are a perfect fit."
"This show is NOt for kids. In fact ,  the lead character is a man driven by anger and humiliation to do everything that is wrong.  He literally breaks bad in his fifties as he condemned to die from cancer.  The show is well written with a large amount of very dark comedy in it.  It's very unpoliitcally correct in a bad way , but it also does depict how nasty some people are. Meth of course is destroying whole communities , so the writers picked the most offensive drug they could for the character to fall into. After all breaking bad pot man wouldn't be that offensive would it?  The acting is great , with  emmies' won by cast members over the years. This is not a nice show , but it is dark and horribly funny.  This looks best in hd of course.  SO a blu ray would be the best way to go. or hd video."
"The unsettling tale of a good man turned bad out of desperation to not leave his family with mountains of debt.  What's the solution?  Open a meth lab with one of his old students and proceed down the dangerous path of operating with criminals and their drug lord overseers.  To complicate matters his brother-in-law is with the DEA, his wife is pregnant and his teenage son has cerebral palsy.  There's a lot of humor interwoven with the more serious themes which I can understand or this would be unwatchable.  The emotional arc of the main character, a borderline genius, is one of the more refreshing elements to watch.  Think from caterpillar to butterfly (but in a bad way).  Good to great supporting cast (Hank is the best).  Extremely clever uses of chemistry (especially with fulminated mercury). It has won several Emmies since 2008, including PeaBody Award (2008) and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (2010).  CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; HUMOR: B plus to A minus; CHEMISTRY USES: A; WHEN WATCHED: January 2011; MY GRADE: B plus to A minus."
Wish I started watching it back when it was new but never too late. Thinking about buying the 2nd season.
"I hear it gets rather raunchy as things progress but am nonetheless eager to watch further episodes, until I can't take it anymore, that is!"
"Great shows don't come around too often, but 'Breaking Bad' is one that belongs at the top the list! Great drama, action, comedy, acting and story telling make this show a must see! While this season only had 7 episodes, it packed more entertainment than 90% of the theatrical films released in the same year.The story of a high school chemistry teacher who finds out he has lung cancer is both heartbreaking and shocking. The casting is perfect, the story is gripping and it's the kind of show that will have you saying OMG more than once an episode. The series is filmed in widescreen to give it that movie look and there is plenty of adult action to keep the most jaded viewer interested from start to finish. If you like TV shows like 'Rescue Me' or films like 'Pulp Fiction' you will love the show! Don't pass this one up folks!...it's a knock out!If I have one gripe it's that I think the price is a bit steep for such a short season, but considering the episodes are 46 minutes long. you can count them as 14 episodes of a standard 22 minute sitcom. Regardless of the  short season, the release is full of interesting extra material and looks wonderful on Blu Ray."
"I had heard about breaking bad from friends for years, but in my quest to not spend so much time watching TV I resisted for years. I finally broke down and bought the first 2 seasons on blu ray and I can't stop watching them! Bryan Cranston is an amazing actor and I can't wait to catch up on all the seasons (up to season 3 already and I still can't stop watching!!)"
Just finished season one and started season two. Was convinced to try watching by my daughter. She was right it is addictive! ( no pun intended)
"Character development at its best. At first  I was reluctant, not wanting even to watch episode one, season one, of this series. In spite of my reluctance, the name of the series kept on popping up in random conversations with my friends, and Netflix continued to suggest it based on my interests. I finally gave it a shot and was extremely satisfied with not only the quality of the acting, of the film (filmed in 35 mm film), but also on the strength of the story itself.Walter White, the protagonist of the series, is a high school, genius chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with Stage IIIA lung cancer. After being told that the cancer was inoperable, and sneaking a peek into his bank account, he realizes his financial situation isn't healthy at all, worse off when he is offered medical treatment costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. S*** truly hit the fan for Mr. White. With less than a year to solve his financial crisis and having to pay a bucket load of cash for his treatment, Walter White recurs to a less reputable business to ensure his family's financial situation before he lays down on his deathbed. His brother-in-law, a DEA agent, spoils hims by saying a meth-cook may make up to seven hundred grand in less than a couple of batches of methamphetamine. Being a chemistry genius, he has no problem in conjuring the most perfect, purest recipe for cooking meth. He wouldn't imagine hell would break loose while dealing with the maniacs in this dark business. He thought he would be staying within the confinement of his RV meth-lab and living his normal parallel life.At the beginning the purpose of the series was for Walter to justify the ""righteous"" act of providing for his family's future when it meant going to the dark-side of money-making by not selling, but actually making the drugs: cooking meth (a.k.a crystal meth, ice, clouds, crystal, glass, tik, catch my drift?). It felt wrong but somehow, the fact that he was desperately struggling to keep his family from falling into the brink made the illicit act seem righteous.Molecular visuals of METH.Did you know that meth has a medical use? It's used for ADHD, narcolepsy, and treatment-resistant depression.After many attempts to sell what was renown as the purest meth out there, ""the blue stuff"", Walter and Jesse (his partner, a former high school student who is known to be a mediocre meth-cook) found trench after trench, failing at their attempts to make money by selling their product, which albeit highly addictive, always seemed to fall into the wrong hands. Fail after epic-fail, they found themselves delving into the dark-world of selling drugs, not at all expecting it to be such a treacherous path. They then recur to an alternate source of selling their genius-formula by contacting a fearless and very well respected business man and drug lord, a strategy they would eventually regret.For me the series has been very enjoyable, with more than just a great story-line and more than just action-and-adventure psychological excitement. Character development was the biggest takeaway for me from this series: How a man in search of a path, once thought righteous and bittersweet, found that he, in the contrary of rejecting the darkest parts of himself as he deepened into the dark-side, embraced them--the bitter portions of darkness gone after a prolonged dose of positive reinforcement upon earning heaps of cash by selling batch after batch of meth. How the character devolves was supremely achieved by the actor, Brian Cranston, winning him the Prime Time Emmy Award for three consecutive years in 2008, 2009, and 2010.In parallel with Walter's charter development, I also admire Jesse Pinkman's (Aaron Paul) devolution into a darker creature, more menacing, less tolerant and much less merciful. If he started out as a meth-head, he slowly turned into an character of many layers, of half-patched hidden depths. After having suffered beatings, the death of his true-love, and warming up to the idea of shooting people in the face, Pinkman becomes a man to fear, a man who has seen too much and is willing to die even if it means to defend what little is left of the world he loves.At the beginning of each episode, I was a little bothered by knowing I would have to watch so many more episodes that were fifty minutes long each, but hell, the production and quality of each one is so good that once you start watching it, you're lured into its mind-gripping world; you can't just shake it off. You'll end up watching the whole series in a matter of weeks.Season 5 is said to bring us a total of 16 episodes, divided in two parts. The first part was debuted last year, and the second part will be premiered in August 2013. It will surely be a blast as Mr. White's, Jesse's, Skyler's and Hank's future is wagered by the odds.DISCUSSION:I've asked myself many times these two questions in the midst of each episode:Could a series like this one actually increase the production of the drug ""meth"" by amateurs in their own ""RV super lab""? Or could it, in the contrary, decrease the amateur production and consumption of the drug after seeing what effects it has on peoples' lives and the appalling consequences it could have to their families?"
"I love this show and won't bother to echo the many good reviews.  I'm just adding my hit on the symbolism of the names.  ""Walter"" is reminiscent of ""Walter Mitty"" the repressed, nerdy guy who dreamed of bigger things. ""White""---well he is the prototype good guy, lilly white and always doing the right thing. (This is great fodder for Jungian analysts.) ""Schwartz"" as they explain, his ex-colleague in grad school, means ""black"" and he has stolen Walt's ideas and made a fortune from them.  They had together formed ""Gray Matter"" which included both of them but apparently Schwartz got greedy and cheated out Mr. White.  Then there is the interesting Jesse Pinkman---who is neither all white in his behavior nor all bad. (I came to love Jesse.)  He spills his share of blood but shows a good heart.  Then...the sexy, hot and beautiful assistant principal, Carmen, (red, if you don't already know) who seems to have the hots for the suffering White.  I'm only in the beginning of the second series so I hope to see more of Senorita Carmen.So far, so good....looking forward to more..in spite of too much violence for my taste.My only complaint is that some of those home homes don't look like any I've seen in Albuquerque and I've lived there.  All those leafy trees and green lawns....looks more like Southern California or Michigan than anything I've seen in New Mexico."
"it took a few episodes to really get into the rythem of this series. From the start anyway I was definately addicted. But by the end of seaon 1 I knew this is the kind of television that goes far beyond the typical material. It's powerful stuff. By season 2 of found my self so additcted that I couldn't watch less than 3 episodes at a time. I've seen every season of The Sopranos, and every season of 24, and up until I discovered this series I thought TV couldn't get any better, but I was definately wrong. This is riveting story tellling. The tension, realism, originality, and creative visuals makes this probably this best series I think I have ever seen on TV. At times gut wrenching. Other times brutally realistic. And at other times suprisingly heart touching. Never predictable and always absolutely top notch and exciting story telling. Its bold, powerful and simply unlike anything you've ever seen before. Season 1 was grade A, but season 2 is so completely astounding it's hard to imagine anything coming close to the masterful achievement this series had acomplished. It's simply breathtaking story telling I can't recommend enough., This rates as the best in television hands down. Fantastic visuals, incredible writing, and might I be as bold to say that Vince Gilligan is truly a gifted writer and director. This is simply an astounding achievement in film making, Be it television or motion pictures. I can't recommend this series enough."
My son loves this season and I bought this season for him so he can enjoy it again.  I rated it 5 stars
"The season that started everything for Walt. I suggest you watch this if you are into action, and drama. What a great show."
"Breaking Bad TV series is an outstanding piece of work from the cast and crew. Kudos to the director for making this one of the very best TV series that I have ever watched in my life. I rarely praise any TV drama but honestly this TV series is one of the most addicting series ever. The work is technically perfect! Everything is well done from acting to sound effects to storytelling. There is something for everyone in the household to watch and enjoy.Warning! After watching this series, you will find most other popular TV series dull and boring! I am confident that within less than 10 mins into the season 1 episode 1 show you will get addicted and cannot stop watching the series.Excellent! 5 Stars!"
"First I want to say that this series is great and if you haven't seen it yet or are unsure about it, buying this affordable set is a great way to test it out with the first seven episodes now available in high def. If you like those episodes or if you're one of the people who already love this series then this Blu-Ray Set is for you. It contains the complete first season of AMC's Breaking Bad in seven one hour long episodes.In short the plot is a more serious Bryan Cranston than we've seen playing chemistry teacher Walter White, who gets diagnosed with cancer. With a son, Walter Jr, who is disabled and a wife, Skyler, who is pregnant with her second child in her late thirties he decides the best way to take care of his family is to start making crystal meth with one of his old dead beat students, Jesse. The further he goes to try and provide for his family the darker and more complicated his life becomes with crazy drug dealer's, increasing extended family issues with his wife's sister, Marie, and to top it off a bother in law, Hank, who is a Drug Enforcement Administration Officer.The episodes found on this set are:Ep 1: Pilot - Walter White is a high school chemistry teacher who learns that he has lung cancer. With a new lease on life, Walter becomes a drug dealer to secure his family's financial security.Aired: 1/20/2008Ep 2: Cat's in the Bag... - Following their debacle in the desert, Walter and Jesse are left with a mess to dispose of.

I suggest fans of television that is made like movies give both these series a try. Breaking Bad's first season barely broke the surface of these character's and the storyline possibilties they hold. Thanks for your time."
Amazing start to the greatest tv show that has yet to come out. No show has ever induced so much binge watching out of me watched the first 4 seasons on netflix over the course of a few days
"I've now caught up on BREAKING BAD by watching all of Season One on DVD and Season Two on DVR.  I've been extremely impressed by what I've seen so far, and consider all that I've seen so far to be first rate.  While I'm not yet convinced that this is going to end up a truly great series, it clearly has enormous potential and is buoyed by several exceptional performances, especially by Bryan Cranston as Walter White.Just about everything that has taken place so far on the show has been beyond criticism.  My hesitation in proclaiming this a masterpiece or even one of the best shows currently on television stems from a lack of sense what the endgame of the show is.  Only time will eliminate my hesitancy.  If it turns out that Vince Gilligan has a clear vision of where this show will eventually end up and if that vision is compelling, then this will indeed go down as a great series.  Does Gilligan have a rough storyboard for the entire series?  Or does he just have a rough idea of where the next season is going?  It is an important distinction.  Although Ron Moore repeatedly hinted that he had only a few ideas of where he was taking BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, the ending and the way it deeply coheres with so much that happened even in the first couple of seasons leads me to believe that he was essentially deceiving us and really knew all along.  Contrast this with a series that was just making it up as it went along, THE X-FILES (a series upon which Gilligan worked extensively).  Although there were many great episodes on that show and a host of memorable aspects, in the end it was a show that was greatly harmed by the ramshackle long story arc, with a host of variant versions of key events (e.g., what precisely happened to Mulder's sister and who his father was, answers to which changed several times over the course of the show).  We simply haven't had enough episodes of BREAKING BAD for us to tell whether there is an end towards which everything is pointing.That being said, there are a number of things I really love about this show.  Sticking with narrative structure for the moment, I like that many of the episodes more or less pick up from the end of the previous episode.  I'm a passionate believer in the superiority of serial narrative.  Almost without exception all the TV series that I have loved over the course of the past twenty years have featured serial narratives; virtually none have been episodic.  I love the complexity of character and story that can result from this.  And BREAKING BAD clearly has embraced the serial format.  This will, in the end, be a series with a definite beginning, middle, and end.I also have been blown away -- along with everyone else -- by Bryan Cranston as Walter White.  He was good in MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE, but he is so much better in this it is as if Jerry Seinfeld had gone to sleep and work up Laurence Olivier.  The range and depth of his performance is absolutely astonishing.  I especially love how nuanced he makes Walter.  Although someone engaged in criminal activity, he does so from a sense of moral obligation.  He is pursuing immoral means to achieve a moral end.  Above all he is a man dedicated to caring for his family.  At no point is this illustrated more than in the moment where he compiles a list of the reasons for sparing and the reasons for killing Crazy Eight, a drug dealer being held in his partner's basement.  In the ""not to kill"" column he has a long, long list of compelling reasons.  In the ""kill"" column, there is only one:  if he lets him go he will kill both him and his family.  That pretty much sums up Walter.  He will do no wrong, unless by so doing he endangers his family.Another thing I love about the show is the wide range of responses it evokes.  Although essentially a drama, I find myself laughing constantly.  His life has been reduced to one long absurdity, and Gilligan does not hesitate to emphasize this by showing how ridiculous things are.  But the show can turn on on a dime to go from humorous or dramatic, to out and out shocking.  There are many, many OMG! moments one the show.This has become one of the shows that I simply won't miss.  No one who cares about quality television should neglect catching up on this one ASAP."
"My introduction to the greatest TV drama of all time, and the beginning of Walt's downfall. &#34;Crazy Handful of Nothin&#34; is the episode that hooked me, with one of the coolest  Heisenberg moments ever!"
This show is awesome.  i got rid of cable last year (one of the best ideas i've had) but i miss shows like this.  i had no idea breaking bad was this good.  a must watch if you're like me and don't have time to watch much.
"People who wax philisophical about this being the Golden Age of television arent off in any way.  Never before in my life have I been around so many solidly great shows airing at once.  I'm not saying this is universal, because of course this is also the era of reality TV, but between The Wire, Dexter, Numb3rs, Lost, Californication, etc, etc, I've never before been as excited about what is possible with television as an entertainment media.  I think we have far and away trumped movies as far as overall content and originality.  Movies are all about the ""remake"" these days, but shows like Breaking Bad are about as original as you could possibly ask for.I wont really get into too much thematic elements or subject items, because I dont want to spoil one second of this extremely brief Season 1, but Bryan Cranston absolutely hits it out of the park with his portrayal of ""average middle class dad"".  He plays it so numb, then breaks bad with such force...I honestly think this is one of the performances of the year.  I'm not overstating this in any way, he's phenomenal.  He makes you so sympathetic to his plight that you really watch each episode absolutely rooting for him to best the challenging sitution he's involved in.  He's the baddest nerd that ever was.Give this show one episode, and you'll be hooked, and go ahead and set aside another six hours to marathon the rest of the series.  Its that good."
"There's really nothing more to say.  I was hooked by the end of the first episode.  The writing was spectacular.  The acting was great.  And it had you craving more.  The worst part about the show was that it had to end.  If you&#8217;ve never seen the show, you definitely want to check it out.  Trust me, you will not be disappointed."
"Why oh why only seven episodes?  This is a great and addictive series that leaves you hungry for more. Ah, but maybe that's the idea.  Bryan Cranston is absolutely fearless as the cancer stricken high school chem teacher who has a lovely wife, a bright disabled son, and a daughter on the way.  He's also got a brother in law who is in law enforcement, and a talent for cooking meth that makes him a legend in Albuquerque.  Meth means money, and money means the best in chemo and other treatments.  Of course, it also means dangerous company, accidents and other physical dangers, and lots of pressure to produce more meth.minor spoiler below.....Cranston is also heartbreakingly good in the intervention scene, in which he at first lays out his case for not wanting to be sickened by the treatments...before he changes his mind.Very strong episodes."
"The first season of ""Breaking Bad"" establishes the tone for Vince Gilligan's series; Gilligan was fascinated with the idea of someone who went from an ordinary guy to the epitome of evil; Walt (Emmy winner Bryan Cranston)after being pushed out of a company that he helped co-found has adjusted to life as a High School chemistry teacher married to Skylar(Anna Gunn) expecting their second child when Walt finds out he has inoperable idiotpathic non-small cell. lung cancer. Determined to leave a nest egg and to pay for his cancer treatments without breaking his family for his family after discovering how much money amateurs make creating crystal meth, Walt decides to do the same thing with the assistance of a former student and drug dealer named Jessie (Emmy winner Aaron Paul). As Walt fights cancer and produces drugs he changes profoundly. He discovers the darkness that always lurked in his soul and allows it to consume him.Walt also must contend with his DEA brother-in-law (Dean Norris who is marvelous and often overlooked by the Emmy committee)and the fear he will find out about his extracurricular activities and try and prevent what he is doing from both Skylar and his physically handicapped son Walt Jr. (R. J. Mitte)The Blu-ray for the first season looks quite nice although the show occasionally looks a bit soft. It's not a pristine prsentation but the show looks quite nice with improved detail (the video noise is occasionally a bit distracting and in the form of increased 'grain'). Before the Blu-ray I had rented the DVD set back in 2009 and it has many of the same strengths and weaknesses as this set just not quite as noticeable because of the lower resolution of DVD. Most folks probably won't notice the minor flaws in the transfer and, on the whole, the presentation is quite pleasing. Colors pop while depth and detail are noticably improved.The first season was shorter than all the other seasons with only seven episodes and they are spread over two 50 gig discs.The lossless 5.1 audio sounds marvelous and is top notch. English SDH and Spanish subtitles are available.The special features although limited compared to other sets. We get two audio commentary tracks on both the pilot featuring Cranston, Gilligan and a number of other cast members and also on ""Crazy Handful of Nothing"" on the second disc.We also get deleted scenes for three episodes as well as auditon footage for Gunn, Paul and actress Betsy Brandt (who plays Skylar sister Marie).We also get a featurette ""The Making of 'Breaking Bad'"" as well as an excerpt of the show ""Shoot Out"" about the improved quality of cable TV shows. ""Inside 'Breeaking Bad'"" is a series of short featurettes. ""Vince Gilligan's Photo Gallery"" can be viewed as a slide show.The first season of ""Breaking Bad"" establishes the tone of this brilliant show--one of the finest written shows on TV--and although the first season was unnecessarily short (due to the Writer's Strike at the time as I recall), the quality of the show is high.Highly recommended."
It was a surprise ending and I was let down only in that it was the end of the show. Many of my favorite characters were killed but good prevailed in the end. Wish more series like this were on TV instead of the competitions and reality junk. I love a good story and good acting.
About life after nuclear war.  Amazon needs to get rest of series doesn't have it all.  I highly recommend. It.
"Watched season 1, got hooked on it, so when season 2 came out I had to watch it.  I like the show, actors, and the content of this show.  Would recommend it to everyone."
"A top 10 show cut short. I can't say how much I enjoyed this show and was depressed and sorry to see it end. You really do root for the characters and they are well developed. How awesome is it to see an alternate Usa after the bombs go off. In many ways there are similarities to the current Usa with corruption at the highest levels and frustration with how things are run at the lowest levels being the common citizen. This is a must watch for any end of the world type of fan. There is allot of action and plot twists. I love how Texas was shown to be tough and key to the future of the country just as in History Texas has been a key state. I am a walking dead fan, breaking bad, arrow, Viking and Game of thrones to show some of my favorites if you like any of those shows you will love this one! I watched it free on Prime but would of paid as well. Just watch it as the reviews show it is a 5 start show!!"
"There were one or two that dropped in excitement a little, but all in all great story. The actors developed and interacted well. To bad it ended after only two seasons."
"It was a well written show, that was cut short. The plot was very possible, are characters did an amazing job selling the idea. The show was very addictive, the excitement stay at a constant rate."
I show parts of this show in my US History class near the end of the year.  It is what I personally think is a good representation of what would happen to humanity if parts of the country fell apart.  There are flaws in some of the physics but I can live with that.  I deal more with the psychology of the whole thing and how people would react to an American ending event.  Story is excellent and the acting is really good.  The second season was short and wasnt as edgy as the first season but a lot of unanswered questions are answered and all in all it was a good season.
"I wish they would have finished the season, kind of a let down. I am going to buy the books though. I hope the money goes to the author and not the short visioned dweebs who dropped the series!"
"The season was way too short. It kinda didn't have a proper development. Skeet Ulrich is a underrated actor since Scream. Jericho was a very well written & acted drama, even though it was political I digged it."
an interesting plot line.  How everyone reacts is interesting and makes you think what you would do in a massive disaster.Hope nothing like this happens but it makes you think.
A fitting end to an exciting show.  The second season is only 6 episodes long but very worthy to watch.  There is an ending to the show though it leaves an opening for something more.  Very nicely done.  I wish there could have been more.
Watch it and see how America overcome comes domestic terrorism and once again victorious. True Americans are some of the toughest with courage and strength that shows through in this film.
"Best &#34;what if&#34; series I've seen since  the &#34;Amerika&#34; mini series years ago.Very good acting.  Very convincing.Hollywood used the &#34;nuclear blasts&#34; scenario, but I honestly don't believe that scenario will be the catalyst to bring this country (actually this planet) to it's knees.  I believe it's going to be some major cosmic event that's going to change this planet and the life of every living thing on it.  No one knows exactly what's going to happen, but it more than likely will be life changing."
"When this show came out on TV I tried to watch every episode, but life sometimes got in the way.  Watching every episode on Amazon Prime is the perfect way to enjoy the work of the writers and splendid actors without having to miss key elements in the story.  They did a teriffic job and I just wish they had had the OK to make more episodes before the show was shut down.  Of course nuclear war is the nightmare that no one in their right mind ever wants to happen.  But as the story shows, the human spirit can rise above great tragedy and rebuild."
"Wish they had continued on with this.  Husband, sons and I all enjoyed the series.  Great story line.  Seems plausible.  Makes you think."
AWESOME SHOW!!!!!! I DID NOT WATCH IT WHEN IT WAS ON TV(BAD TIMING) IT KEEPS U HANGING ON WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN!!!  WITH NO ADVERTIZING U GET THE WHOLE SHOW...NO LAG...TO BAD IT WAS CANCELED
"This show needs to be rebroadcast over and over, and brought back to the networks. This country needs a lot more Major Becks. Like PFC Manning, and Ed Snowden. Libertarians, this is the show for you!"
Great show. It is also a difficult TV show to quit and do something else that I have to do. It is worth spending time to watch the entire episodes.
This show is an example of how good TV can be.  The situations and characters were all interesting.  Each episode had lots of tension.  You never knew what was coming next.  I recommend this show for anyone.
"Pounded through this show, the 30 episodes has some bumps, but all and all is a great ride.  There are some great stories and intertwining of story lines with giving you just enough new information each show to keep you interested."
The best and the worst of human behavior is brought to life in this series as a small town copes with the aftermath of a nuclear war. The adorable Skeet Ulrich leads a stellar ensemble cast in this compelling drama. I wish the show had lasted a few more seasons. A contemporary and relevant show...
"If you like survivor check this out. I really liked it, well worth the ten bucks. I want to own them all and I don't usually like reality TV."
"I love Survivor and it doesn't get better than this. This is, without doubt, my favorite season. Don't hesitate to check it out."
"Probably my favorite season of Survivor yet. Blindsides and backstabbing galore, just how I like my Survivor. It was so good I ended up watching the whole season in one day!"
"this season of Survivor. I won't tell you the winner's name, but she played a fantastic game and is beautiful to look at. All the challenges were great and great statigizing by all the players."
There are several island shows in a row and this one showed the vast number of islands surrounding the location and volcanos.  I always like the shows and enjoy watching over and over.
The only reason for watching this movie or owning it is because of robert englund. and jenna jameson. This movie was actually pretty good. robert englund is awesome. and jenna jameson is totally hot. if love these two actors then you'll love this movie
"First do not let the name fool you, yes there are strippers and some nudity, but no more than in the average horror flick.  This movie if HILARIOUS!  The political satire is utterly priceless and I thought the cast was lots of fun.  You KNOW they had a ball doing this, it shows.  This has quickly become one of my favorite Zombie/Comedy classics.  Sure, there are some continuity problems, but so what?  It is so much fun who cares!  Take a chance on this little known gem, you won't be disappointed!!"
"This movie is a must see and one of the best. The film had a lot of twists toward the end but kept me interested. The film uses an unfolding mystery and atmosphere to create fear. The feel of this movie is dark and foreboding throughout the film. Simple things made this movie: the desolate seaside location...the cliffs...a burlap mask... The house itself is creepy with dark corners. Dripping water, creaking floorboards added to the ominous feel of the movie. Only one scene involved gore - and the entire theater gasped when it happened. Rueda is wonderful as the tormented mother Laura. She carries this film to the end with palpable desperation. She appeared thin, and was not made up with hair and makeup which created more belief in her character. Hollywood actresses could take notes on her believability and strong performance.TOP NOTCH scrip/chills & acting  MUST SEE!!! This movie has the feel the ""The Others"" and has an ""M. Night"" twist towards the end."
"I love a well-told ghost story. THE ORPHANAGE is fantastic! It is a flesh-bubbler w/ loads of mystery and dread. If you enjoyed THE CHANGELING (w/ George C. Scott), THE HAUNTING (the original version), or any intelligent spooker, then consider this movie a gift from the ghoul-gods! I was very satisfied w/ the story, the heavy atmosphere, and the puzzle to be solved. The ending is both terrifying and heart-breaking at once. THE ORPHANAGE deals w/ the agony of tragic loss as well as the supernatural. It is a human story that slowly shifts into nightmare. It is also about the unbreakable bond between a mother and son. Highly recommended. Spanish w/ english subtitles..."
"Guillermo Del Toro delivers again!The Orphanage or El Orfanto, whichever name you would like to call it, is excellent! It's a movie at its best! Great storyline, great characters, a little spookiness and alot of twist & turns that you will never see coming!The trailer for this movie, makes it out to much scarier than it is, but the movie will not disappoint.If you watch this movie and like/love it, watch Del Toro's other movies, they are all good- Pan's Labyrinth, The Devil's Backbone and Hellboy!"
"It's a good movie. A different ghost story. Also a good movie the ""Devil's Backbone""."
"The old, old stone mansion that once was an orphanage sits isolated within its ill-kempt gardens and grounds. The abandoned lighthouse on the cliff not far away no longer shines a beacon. The cave below and the sandy beach still receive the incoming tide. Be wary. Laura Sanchez grew up in the orphanage. When she was about seven she was adopted and left. Now she is 37, married to Carlos, and they are parents to a little boy, Simon, about seven. They adopted Simon, who doesn't know this, and who is deadly ill with a disease only pills can keep at bay. Now Laura and Carlos have just bought the abandoned orphanage and are moving in. It is a large building of many rooms and hallways, with dark oak paneling, old fire places and frosted, etched glass. They hope to make it a home for children with special needs. There are no children yet, just Simon.Simon makes friends, make-believe friends. They tell him things, he says. ""I won't grow old. I'm not going to grow up,"" he tells his mother. ""Will you be like Peter Pan?"" Laura asks. ""Like my new friends,"" Simon says. ""There's more than one?"" ""Six."" ""They won't grow up either?"" Laura asks. Simon looks at her. ""They can't,"" he saysSimon leads Laura in a game to discover clues, a game he and his friends have invented. Suddenly the game is foreboding. ""You're not my mother!"" Simon screams at Laura. ""Who told you that?"" she asks, stricken that this little boy, her son, is facing something she and her husband were waiting to tell him when he was older. ""My friend told me,"" Simon says. ""What friend?"" ""Tomas,"" Simon yells, crying and defiant. ""Tomas told me the truth, that I'm just like them.... I have no mother or father and I'm going to die.""Days later, Simon disappears, apparently kidnapped. The parents, with Laura increasingly frantic, try everything to find him. In time, there will only be Laura and this moldering stone mansion where she was raised as an orphan with other orphans. We begin to learn what happened there when Laura as a child left.So...whose imagination, whose story are we inhabiting?""Horror"" is a term that has been debased in the movies over the last thirty years or so. Technology and computers have eliminated most of the need for imagination and the kind of dread we make for ourselves out of little things. Market research drives so many creative decisions into the dead end of splatter and special effects. The Orphanage is just slightly a horror movie. It is lonely, deliberative, sad, thoughtful, even quiet, even, surprisingly, with a degree of contentment at the conclusion.All the actors do fine jobs, and there is a notably quiet and intense performance by Geraldine Chaplin as a psychic whose own death is near. It is Belen Rueda as Laura who helps make this movie something special. There are so many opportunities for intense ""acting,"" distraught ""acting,"" tearful ""acting."" Rueda does nothing of this. We believe her as Laura because she doesn't try to over-dramatize Laura. Laura is often intense and sometimes distraught. She also puzzles through this mystery, is determined to find her son and can take action. But Rueda never overacts. Thanks to Rueda's performance and fine directing and screenwriting, I think The Orphanage establishes itself as an unusual and intriguing movie.The audio and video transfers are very good. There are some typical ""How we made the movie"" extras. If you have a taste for unusual and unsettling stories, I recommend you tryThe InnocentsandThe Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)."
"THE ORPHANAGE is scary.  Not Hollywood-hey-let's-show-all-our-cards scary.  I'm talking about cover your eyes, look away, symbolic terror.  A woman wiping her face with what we know to be human ashes.  Creepy figures half-seen and then gone.  This is a film that gets under your skin.The plot is fairly simple: Laura moves into the orphanage where she grew up.  With her is her adopted son Simon and her husband Carlos.  Before moving into the Orphanage, Simon had two imaginary friends; after a day in the new place, he has six.  And then a strange old lady shows up...and then Simon goes missing.  Months pass, and eventually Laura feels compelled--against her husband's wishes--to seek help from beyond.The film plays with typical horror stereotypes: creepy old buildings; creepy little children; creepy old people.  What makes everything work here is director J.A. Bayona's understated style; he doesn't spell things out for us, he lets the tension--and character development--build, until we reach a gut-wrenching climax.  You can see it coming, of course; the problem with horror films these days is that there's not a lot that hasn't been done.  Thus, we must focus on HOW it is done; and in this regard, THE ORPHANAGE excels.The lead performances from Belen Rueda and Fernando Cayo are rock-solid; supporting roles--especially an incredibly spine-chilling turn from Geraldine Chaplin--are just as good.  In case you're wondering: Guillermo Del Toro's presence is felt, but only in an off-hand way.  Some scenes are so horrifically beautiful, one can't help but be completely awed.  This is, ultimately, a beautiful little film; not the greatest horror movie ever made, but certainly a rare treasure, and proof that there is still gold to be mined in the genre, even if it takes a fresh face like Bayona to find it."
"Amid the current crop of slasherly, hyperviolent horror films, ""The Orphanage,"" from Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona, stands out as an artful, restrained gem of the genre. The movie is driven by plot, personality, fine acting and gorgeous cinematography.  Although many elements are familiar (with wisps of ""The Shining,"" ""The Devil's Backbone,"" and numerous other classics...) the film still feels fresh.  Lead actor Belen Rueda's turn as a mother fighting to get her child back from the grip of supernatural forces is a powerful performance; indeed, everything about this film is well-crafted and intelligently assembled. Worth checking out!  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)"
"It is a horror movie of sorts, but also a tragedy, and tale of some spiritual dimensions.  Not your standard 'horror' fare or slasher film and audiences who don't come expecting that may find the story, upon reflection, to be quite seamless, clever and ultimately rather satisfying.  I give it 4.5 stars.  It isn't quite the odyssey that Pan's Labyrinth was (different director, same producer), but for what it sets out to do, it accomplishes much.  The cinematography is top notch, as is the acting.  Crystal clear transfer on the DVD.  A story with a bit of a twist.  A story that may leave you feeling oddly hopeful rather than frightened."
"This &#34;ghost story&#34; is simply amazing, I watched it after learning Guillermo Del Toro produced it (Pan's Labyrinth is my absolute favorite movie) and it did not disappoint!  It is a thriller from beginning to end - Definitely worth a look!"
"I love foreign horror movies because they often times breath life into a stale genre. We just don't know how to do it over here anymore. And I loved this movie. It's simple in a lot of ways, but twisted and it sucks you right in. I don't want to give anything away, but you should really check this out. A really great horror movie!"
"THE ORPHANAGE is a terrific ghost movie.Not only does it have plenty of moments that will make you jump in your seat, and I can assure you that I did several times, but it also contains a very intelligent, human story that makes you care about the people involved.The exquisitely photographed Spanish-language picture (with English subtitles) was directed by J.A. Bayona and co-produced by Guillermo Del Toro.  The filmmakers describe it as ""a Peter Pan-like story from the mother's point-of-view"".Belen Rueda, in an award-worthy performance, stars as ""Laura,"" a wife and mother, who with her family buys the seaside house that was once the orphanage where she was raised.  They have no sooner moved into the mansion when her son starts seeing ""invisible friends,"" and shortly after that, he disappears.  Laura's husband (Fernando Cayo) thinks the boy was kidnapped, but Laura is positive that he was taken by the ghostly children in the house.Geraldine Chaplin has a strong cameo role as a medium.Leave the lights on for this one. Michael B. Druxman"
"""The Orphanage"" is a rare horror film whose strong emotions and believable motives make it a tear jerker as well as a supernatural thriller. Laura (Belen Rueda) spent half of her childhood in an orphanage on Spain's coast, before she was adopted. As an adult, she returns to the enormous and beautiful home, long since fallen into disuse, with her physician husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and 7-year-old son Simon (Roger Princep). The couple intend to re-open the establishment as a home for disabled children. But Simon's temperament is becoming belligerent, and he is fast accumulating imaginary friends. Then he disappears without a trace.This is a ghost story, but, in spite of its supernatural elements, ""The Orphanage"" has a rigorous logic. I appreciated that, as horror films so often get sloppy with their narratives. The story is propelled forward by two strong emotions: fear of whatever lurks in the house and Laura's fierce maternal love. Laura takes the audience with her on frantic searches for clues, which give the film an action movie pace and emotional immediacy between the thoughtful lulls. At the halfway point, I thought the film lost its pacing and went off the rails until I realized that the film -and the audience's perception of it- pivots at that point. Then I was impressed by the well-conceived structure.Director J.A. Bayona, writer Sergio G. Sanchez, cinematographer Oscar Faura, and editor Elena Ruiz, amazingly, are all working on their first feature film. Bayona harkens back to the best years of Hollywood genre filmmaking by creating the orphanage completely on a soundstage. It's a stunning set and a wonderful character in the movie. They go easy on the score and try to tell the story visually as much as possible. Belen Rueda makes us feel her anguish, desperation, and fear at the loss of her son. ""The Orphanage"" is top-notch gothic horror, comparable to the best psychological thriller/horror films that have come out of Asia in recent years. In Spanish with optional subtitles.The DVD (New Line 2008): ""When Laura Grew Up: Constructing the Orphanage"" (16 min) interviews director, producers, writer, cast, et al about characters and themes, acting with children, the set, digital effects, and the score. ""Tomas' Secret Room: The Filmmakers"" (10 min) is a documentary in 5 parts about various aspects of production: the crew, the score, the orphanage, digitally effects, the title sequence. ""Horror in the Unknown: Make-up Effects"" (9 min) interviews the make-up artists about Tomas, Laura's leg, and Begnina's make-up. In ""Rehearsal Studio: Cast Auditions and Table Read"" (3 min), the director talks about working with the actors. There are 6 Still Galleries of 198 sketches and photos. ""Marketing Campaign"" includes 2 Spanish trailers, 2 US trailers, and 12 posters. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish."
"I decided to buy this based on the good reviews and the fact that Guillermo del Toro--one of my very fave directors, and the director of my fave ghost story--The Devil's Backbone--produced this.Well, no disappointment here. Not in any part. The acting, the direction, the scenery, the set design, the script, the music, the ending--it all worked together, all paid off.This starts off slowly, gently. But from the first images of children playing a game in the yard fronting a large, mansion-style orphanage--the shadows, the direction, the way the action of an innocent game is set up--perfectly sets the tone of the film. It's nostalgic, but it's also slightly creepy. It foreshadows a lot. Pay attention.Zoom years later. One of those children who'd been playing in the yard, the girl Laura, is now grown with a son. We find out the main characters--mother Laura, father, son Simon--have purchased the former orphanage and plan to set up a residence to care for special needs children. Simon, himself, is  a special needs child: He has HIV.Soon, the game of ""invisible friends"" takes on an ominous reality. And every scene builds tension, builds, builds, until we really are at the edge of our seat as this mother is thrown into the greatest nightmare of parents.The film then asks the question--of the lead and of the viewer--how far will a mother, this mother, go to find her missing son?While the conclusion felt inevitable and was pretty obvious quite early on (the clues are all there, and the script does not cheat), it's the HOW of getting to it that makes this all work. Almost all is fairly foreshadowed, but the small actions and words that lead us along to those conclusions can be easily missed if we focus on something that seems more emotional.I cannot describe how beautiful the finale--the climactic moment-- is. Tragedy, sorrow, redemption and beauty all coalesce. It is a miraculous cooperation of acting/direction/storytelling/setting/lighting and music that brings us to this moment of bittersweet magic.The denouement is lovely, too, leaving us with a feeling of what we lose as human beings, mortal beings, and what we can gain if there is more than mere matter.Tragedy redeemed--that's what I thought as I went to bed after seeing this.Yes, this is a ghost story that disturbs mightily, and the scares are surely present, but it is not a gore-show. It is a more human and artistic ghost story, and is in fact MORE than a ghost story. It's a story of family and friendship, and of a mother who will not give up, because the deepest love outlives the grave, even defeats the grave.You really need to see this film. Magnificent. (And pay very close attention to EVERYTHING, for all the strings come together in the end.)Mir"
"I encourage everyone to see this movie, The Orphanage, this is incredible!!!!!! It gets you glued to the tv!!!!! Its just the best thriller movie and the director is fantastic!!!!!! DEFINITELY WORTH BUYING!!!!!! INCREDIBLE EXCELLENT FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I fully figured this film to be pretty much what I expected, which was another over rated supernatural thriller. Indeed within the first 30 minutes I was feeling like it might be just that. I found that portion of the film to be pretty average noting along the way the superb acting and production values. But the film quickly gets much more atmospheric and fills its canvas with an unusally creepy and melodramtaic tone. The story s suprisingly unique even if there were moments that seemed like they could have been inspired by films like Poltergiest or The Others. As a solidly moody supernatural story this film ranks as one of the better ones I have seen. And there is plenty of good creepy scares and horror along the way. The film gets more intense as it goes along. I found this film to sometimes be a soild performer as horror films go. It was often indeed very creepy and made me squirm more than once, I foud my self biting my nails, which is something I havent done in a good long time at the movies. There was some subject matter here and there that seemed a little bit contrived and predictable, and the end was not much of a suprise, but mildly touching. Some members who reviewed this film commented that it made them cry. Im figuring they were refering to the end. But the end really didnt bring me to tears, and I love a good tear jerker the same as the next person. I agree though that it was rather touching at then end though. Its rare that a horror thriler really is truly good nowadays, but this one delivered some solidly crafted chills that really made the movie truly worth taking special notice of. Ive seen better but this movie was truly very good."
"Why is it that Spanish people make the best horror films? They just do! This, THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, and THE OTHERS are some of my favorite horror films. They have the knack for tapping into my deepest paranoias and fears, and I love them for that. I've always enjoyed a good ghost story - ""good"" being the operative word. You don't find many good ghost stories lately. There is most definitely a drought, and so finding a film like THE ORPHANAGE is like finding a needle in a haystack - forgive the cliche. It is terrifying, it is beautiful, and it is heartbreaking. The performances, the direction, the writing, the score, and the SOUND MIX are all top notch and totally effective. I do not wish to go into the story or plot for fear that I may give something away, all that I know is that you should stop what you are doing and rent this, if you are in the mood for a chill. You will not be let down, trust me. You may even get emotional by the end of this film. It's rare to find a film that can scare the piss out of you and make you cry at the same time.RENT IT, BUY IT, whatever, just as long as you SEE IT!"
"Not unlike its predecessor, Pan's Labyrinth, this film is beautifully photographed on a dramatic shore with a lighthouse and an old orphanage that has now become home to a couple with an adopted son.  That the parents have kept the adoption and the boy's HIV status a secret from him, and that his mother had grown up in the orphanage, set in motion a chain of sad and frightening events when the ghosts of dead orphans tell the boy the truth.  There's also a woman who had some information and was also a caregiver for a deformed boy; unfortunately, she is accidentally run over before she can tell Laura, the mother, what she needs to know.The boy, Simon, disappears with the ghost kids and his heartbroken parents spend months searching for him.All of this ends with life after death; Laura, Simon and the others die, but they seem to be very much alive, with Laura caring for them in the nursery since they will not grow any older, and Simon is reunited with her as well.There is even a hint at the end that Laura's husband is greeted by her and the boy, though we will never know for sure.It seems to be a common thread in this director's work that the living and the dead, the reality and the fantasy, are very close together and sometimes intermingle with each other.  I will be very curious to see what he does with The Hobbit."
"The Orphanage is a ghost story in the classic tradition [at various times whilst watching this I was reminded of some of my other favorite ghost stories such as The Changeling, The Others, and at one point, even Dark Water, the Japanese version]. It is high on atmosphere [the imposing gothic mansion in a remote location, sinister looking people, mysterious noises] and has a riveting plot.The story centers around Laura [Belen Rueda] who has moved into her childhood home, an orphanage, with her husband Carlos [Fernando Cayo] a doctor, and their 7 year old son Simon [Roger Princep] who like most children his age has an overactive imagination and an abundance of imaginary friends.They settle in nicely into the old mansion until one day when they go down to the beach to play - Simon lingers in a cave and when Laura comes to get him, he claims he was talking to a 'friend' and even leaves a trail of seashells so that his friend, Tomas can follow him back to the house. At first Laura dismisses Simon's ramblings as the figment of his imagination but soon comes to fear a more sinister  force at play as a game of  'find the treasure' seems much too elaborate to have been cooked up by Simon, revealing a secret that she wishes to keep from Simon.The story gets truly going when a party to welcome the newcomers [Laura and Carlos had decided to take in about 5-6 children into their home, all with some sort of disability] results in the tragic disappearance of Simon [who had opted to play with his imaginary friend than join in the festivities]. The rest of the story centers around Laura's desperate attempts to find her son, even resorting to hiring psychics [one played by Geraldine Chaplin in a very credibly portrayed role] whilst her husband plays the role of the skpetic, refusing to believe in any supernatural explanation for Simon's disappearance.There are some truly chilling moments in this movie - the sinister child with a sack over its face watching Laura in a darkened hallway, mysterious banging sounds that waken Laura at night,the psychic summoning and the discovery of some of the house's old secrets - all these add to the storyline and keep viewers engaged. Though the acting itself is not extraordinary, except perhaps for Belen Rueda's convincing mother in distress Laura, and Geraldine Chaplin's psychic, this is not an issue for the real pull of the movie lies in the subtle unfolding of the plot through a series of 'clues' that lead Laura to what she seeks.A highly recommended ghost story that doesn't rely on any gore, sex or unnecessary special effects, but allows the natural light and atmosphere coupled with some very effective old school effects to tell a classic ghost story."
"Season 2 is the ""bombs."" There were good parts of each episodes. I'm glad that I also owned this copy to watch, over and over again."
"First, thank you to the folks at FX.Not only do you continue to deliver top notch programming for grown-ups, but you also make the seasons to work counterpoint to the other networks, allowing us to watch something other than reruns for more of the year.As season two begins, the moral dilemmas multiply and the plotlines are even more intriguing. Wayne, Dahlia and the two younger kids decide that they like being upper-class and decide to try and keep what they have despite the mounting risks.In another thread, the Travelers also begin to play into the plotline again. Oldest Malloy son Cael decides for good that the house at Eden Falls is stealing his soul, and opts to run away back to the Travelers, who have a new college educated (from prison via (University of Phoenix) spurting his mail order philosophies in order to take control of the clan).The new season is finding more moral and legal dilemma's for Wayne/Doug having to lie to his family and more issues with his less than bright adversary Dale. On the side of that, Dahlia decides she doesn't want to be liar any more finds herself lying to the people she loves most.This show continues to be very good mature audience only entertainment, but not for those who are easily offended, but really you should watch this show from the pilot forward to enjoy it thoroughly."
"Watched the first season pilot on Amazon Prime, and ended up watching 11 hours one day then finished the whole 2nd season the next day. Fantastic. Except the ending. But wow, as if I wasn't already impressed with izzard, this made me an addict. Minnie did the most amazing acting I've ever seen her do. And the youngest boy Sam made me fall in love with the writers and of course the actor. Excellent. I need more please!"
"When I am well entertained and my interest is involved in what will happen next, it's a good program and worth continuing. I highly recommend for entertainment value. Good acting too."
"I give it 5 stars because the show is totally entertaining. Just the right amounts of suspense, excitement and comedy makes this a must watch show for me. Eddie Izzard and Minnie Driver play extremely well off one another. Their kids are played by Shannon Woodward and Noel Fisher who are both engaging and believable. The one downside is that they cancelled the show after only 20 episodes. Please bring back The Riches! :p"
We like this show.  It is good and funny sometimes and serious and dramatic all at once.  Lots of killing but not terribly gruesome.
"I wasn't ready for the show to end.  I wan't a new chapter, the traveler part.  I didn't know who eddie lizard was before this show, and to put minnie driver with him was brilliant.  There was so many chapters to choose from , why end something so brilliant?  This season is great , I just wanted to it to continue..."
"As my review title goes, this was a great show.  Originally I thought it would be a comedy, but it's more of a drama with a lot of irony.  Not your typical formula show, which is why it was so cool but also probably why it got cancelled.  Very disappointed that they cancelled it halfway through the season (can anyone say &#34;Firefly&#34;?) with so many loose threads that will never be tied off."
"I have been a fan of all the top chef seasons, I enjoy the reunion specials they are funny and have a great way of looking back at some of the best parts of the season...They do NOT disappoint."
"This is another winning season for top chef program. As in season three, this show came off with flair, some arguing, a little backstabbing and winning talented chefs, no matter who went packing.  I throughly enjoyed this season as much as season three. What is also nice, that even though these chefs are highly competive and talented, it showed that they can compete and not be totally abrasive in their behavior towards one another.  Give this one a try."
Wonderful. Loved it.
This was my first Top Chef DVD set. I didn't see it on cable. I was very impressed. I loved it. I have bought other seasons. I will be glad when all of the seasons are on DVD. I look forward to ordering them
"i love this season.  if your a fan, like i always say, and even if you dont watch this show, this is a great season to pick any episode you want and you will find that is represents the show.  it has humor, ramsay going nuts, some sex appeal, an ending that is a surprise, and the chefs are tested in many extreme ways.  and there are several chefs that are so nuts, you have to wonder how they make it through as far as they did.  you get a good laugh at the chefs in this season. and so many funny lines.  and of course a lot of really nice prizes along the way.  its just a unique season in my opinion.  you get more in this season than in many of the others and the others are fantastic.  please trust me, especially if your a fan.  just pick an episode.  start with episode one of this season and you will be laughing really hard. even though its a serious show and the finale is huge.  this season is so good you cant go wrong just picking any episode to see if you like it.....there is bad language, and a lot of yelling and screaming.  its in your face tv.  but i love the show.  give it a try and i believe the majority of you will love it......this episode is especially great....and you learn a lot as well....the cool thing about ramsay is he makes everything from scratch, everything is fresh, and no left overs. ever.  that is what makes his food so special.....i really hope you ejoy it....."
"My husband is a huge fan of this show, and was glad the 'Raw and Uncensored' version was available for a good price. Thanks!"
The grans loved it.  It kept a four and five year old happy.  Nothing better in the entire world to me.  Family friendly.
My two year old is self identifying letters! Wherever we go she is pointing out at least 6-8 letters and is consistently correct.
"I love this series for my toddlers, each episode starts off with a book that they explore. Along the way they touch on letter recognition and spelling. Character is loveable and the kids can relate. It's a show I can let my kids watch and not feel guilty."
"This is a neat cartoon that teaches kids to read. Good stories and twists on the classics, would recommend this series for preschoolers"
my 18 mont old recites much of the alphabet and cheers. His fav dvd. Highest recommendation possible. The concept is awesome.
my daughter loves this. she will sit and watch this and interacts with all the things that they ask you to do
"I decided to give &#34;In Plain Sight&#34; a preview on Netflix as it seamed interesting. After the first disk I decided it was good enough to at least give it a chance so I watched the nextdisk and I was hooked!  This show is amazing, each episode has the snitch of the week that goes into Witness Protection and almost every weekly story is a hit.  The real beauty of this show is the ongoing family darama between Mary and her family as well as the shenanigans between her co workers.  As a member of AA for 13+ years I can tell you the family problems related to this are very real life and they show much of this with enough humor to make me appreciate the honesty.  If you buy Season 1 you will be hooked, I have the first three seasons now and will soon buy 4 and 5 to completye my set.  I just can't say enough about this show, IMHO it is remarkable."
"I was in love with a great show,who features a strong woman in its lead.so sorry to hear it was cancelled.such a loss for we the viewing public.:("
In Plain Sight: Season OneLow price.  Arrived quickly and just as described.
"this set of dvd's was a gift for a friend overseas,i'm sure they are going to be disappointed that the series was taken off the air"
I remembered when this show started . I've loved it from the beginning . I finally decided to collect the whole series.  It's a good show.  But it's not one the whole family can watch.
"This is one of the best series I have ever watched with interesting, quirky, characters and a very good story line. Good writers and a top notch leading star kept this misfit marshal returning to my living room season after season."
"I enjoy this series Mary has the type of personality that I like.  I feel this show gives you an insight into how crazy you have to be at home to work in some jobs.  This series will make you laught, sweat and cry."
"i liked the first episode, but by the second, it became clear that this is a GREAT show. the characters are unique and interesting and the twists and turns are actually surprising. if you're in the mood for a wild ride of a show, which looks like it might be a typical crime of the week show but ISNT, download this one. fun fun."
Mary is Juno grown up.  Sympathy wrapped in practicality.  Her family is dysfunctionsl and she has to somehow perform her incredibly difficult and time consuming job and save her sister and mother from themselves.  Her lover is hot.  Christian was previously one of the more successful Dancers with the stars.
See my review of the third season.  I got hooked on the first season but still felt the same after the third season.
"If you're not a fan of the Venture Brothers then I'm not sure why you're even here reading this review.  For fans of the show, I highly recommend season 3.  It's a decent continuation of the show, good story lines and entertaining episodes.  The humor follows the standard formula of the show.  Overall season 3 isn't as good as the first two seasons, but is still well worth watching if you enjoy what came before."
The Venture Bros. are back and season three picks up where we left off from season two.  The monarch now with his wife Doctor Mrs. The Monarch must endure tests from the guild to ensure that they can be villans as well as man and wife.  Meanwhile Doctor Venture is enjoying his Monarch free life and gets back to work in the world of super sicence.  Only to have a new arch enemy Sgt. Hatred razed his front lawn and needing him to fill out a questionaire form about his villany.All this plus the O.S.I out to kill Brock Sampson.  Spiderskull Island new museum deicated to Doctor Jonas Venture.  A message from the past that will save the Earth.  What is the secert of the O.R.B and why it is linked to Rusty's past and the future of all mankind.  What happens when The Venture Compond is turned into a day camp for fans of the Rusty Venture show? We also meet Dermott who thinks he may have met his father at the Venture place.  The Triad gets to select thier arch enemy.  More thrills and chills then anyone can think of as well as a battle to end all battles and a death no one saw coming.So check out season three of the Venture Bros today!
After 3 seasons you might worry the the Venture Bros' parody of 70s and 80s cartoons would get a bit tired.  Don't worry.  The show is a funny and fresh as it ever was.  There is a GI Joe parody half way through that's worth the price of admission.At the same time characters who started as transparent parodies have grown and become fully realized characters that viewers can care about.This is one of the best cartoons on TV and I recommend picking it up.
This is my favorite animated show and I loved this 3rd season when aired on TV as much as I loved the first two seasons. BUT PLEASE STOP CENSORING THE DVD SETS!
"If you like the genre of Super Heroes; you'll love the Flash.  John Wesley Shipp provides the lead character with a humanity, unlike his cartoon version.  This Flash is thoughtful, intelligent and has a sensitivity that other comic adaptations get wrong out of the gate.  The shows cleverly adapt the comics in a way a modern audience will enjoy.  The reason why it was canceled?  CBS didn't have much respect for the genre and kept switching it on different days.  It never found an audience because it never came on the same day each week. Football and other events kept delaying the broadcasts.  I believe it was done to get rid of the show.  Now you can enjoy them all.  I only wish it was allowed to survive.  It was a gem that will never be duplicated again. If you like the Batman, Superman TV shows with a modern twist, this is a show you'll like.  You won't be disappointed!"
"Since I didn't get a chance to watch this when it first came out, I'm glad I finally got to watch it, though I will admit that I skipped around and concentrated on episodes that also included Robin or Batgirl or had plots that I was more interested in.http://batmantheanimatedseries.wikia.com/wiki/Robinandhttp://batmantheanimatedseries.wikia.com/wiki/Batgirlinclude lists of episodes that include Robin and Batgirl.I figured out other interesting episodes by reading the episode summaries on Amazon Prime."
My son loves Batman and this is a decent show for him to watch. While he does prefer live action - this seemed to entertain him.
I love this Batman. Film makers should look to this version of Batman when casting their various versions. Kevin Conroy's voice does this cartoon Batman justice. The voice matches the tall and broody Dark Knight.
This is one of my favorite animated batman series. This is not for younger kids due to some of the more adult story lines and situations. Still good clean good vs evil storyline.
"This show is just generally excellent even the episodes that were clearly rushed or done with the intent of a single viewing are very well acted (voice talent), as well as well illustrated, despite the moments where batman seems to have superman-like abilities to defy gravity; but hey its a kids show at this point in the series, its not until the 3rd season of this show when they started to air it with Superman that superman could be the silly hero, so batman was able to become much more serious. And aloud for the tone of the whole DC animated world to get darker until where we are now where some truly amazing animated movies are coming from the same guys. And as always they are perfect for kids ages: being able to speak and up. Just like this show."
"Enjoy the blend of great writing, well-cast voices, noir/Art Deco atmosphere, and remarkable depth of storytelling! This was the best adaptation of the Bob Kane character until the Nolan Trilogy."
the best batman animated was from 1992 and still is highly recommend the graphics are far better than the newest ones
"My 6 year old son is really enjoying this series and I like that they are 23 minutes long, so it is a quick show to watch."
"Batman Animated done right. After more than 20 years without a Batman (stand alone series) this came out after the Michael Keaton 'Batman&#34; movie with great animation, stories, and voice acting. This was huge in the early 90's on Fox or the WB. The great thing about it was that it brought out story of the  other villians from the comic book that we hadn't seen in the 60's TV series or 60's animated series like &#34;Clayface,&#34; &#34;Killer Croc,&#34; &#34;The Scarecrow,&#34; &#34;Two Face,&#34; etc. Mark Hamill did the voice of &#34;The Joker&#34; after his performance on &#34;The Flash&#34; TV series as the villain &#34;The Trickster.&#34; It's still better than all these other Batman series that have followed and get worse by the year!"
What can I say this has to be the best animation of a cartoon series I have ever seen not to mention it was way ahead of it time when it came out and still going strong as far as stories go directing and development especially with the first 3 season of the seasons.
This is one of the best American cartoon series of all time. The production is made for each 20 something minute show on a movie caliber. The music and transitions are amazing. The characterization of seeing into the eyes of different antagonists (even the sociopath joker) to  and seeing batman as a man with odds with his own psychopathic tendencies and past mistakes.
"I love this show because I grew up watching it. It lasted at least for five or six seasons, eventually crossing paths with superman's animated series. I recommend this for kids and any adults who are big Batman/ DC comic book fans."
"One of my all time favorite Batman installments.  The animation is fabulous for its era and the voice acting is fun.  It is a little dated so some people may find it a little slow, but a definite must see for Batman fans."
"I didn't realize he was born and raised in Michigan!  Being a fellow Michigander I think that is really awesome.  Started acting young, married a beautiful actress.  I enjoy all his films because they were so varied.  Really enjoyed this rental!"
Great collection of movie trivia all about Heston.  He was an interesting character in his own life!
So enjoyed seeing the performances of this impacting actor whose films have entertained and thrilled.  Enjoyed hearing the opinions of fellow actors
"Charlton Heston along with Ronald Reagan were two of Hollywood's &#34;Greats&#34; !  Charlton dominated his scenes and somehow always told you that your existence could be &#34;bigger&#34;, &#34;better&#34;, and more than life itself. This collection was revealing and remembering of his life and movies of all time.  Definitely worth watching."
"Season 5 was SO good.  What a shame, SG-1 was ten seasons, I wish Atlantis could have had a few more.  What a great show.  The visual effects were getting better and better with lots of action, story line and plot twists.  Where are these Stargate Atlantis movies they talked about making?"
They did a nice job.  Characters were interesting.  Plots plausible and stimulating.  Good resolution to issues.  Dialog allowed to be genuine.
"Enjoyed the last show of the epic with its cavalry charge over the hill at the last moment.  Would continue to have followed it if there were more seasons.  The Stargate series is more than just Atlantis and there is a lot of good SciFi left in the writers who have been doing this.  Hopefully, it will re-emerge later as another riveting series.  Great series; great actors; great writers."
The others before me have given great reviews of some episodes and characters so I won't repeat them.I'm here to say buy this and all  seasons-if you love scifi this show and SG1 are one of the best.Can't wait for the movies to start coming out on dvd!
"If you liked the original Star Gate movie,, you will like this show which is the best of the 'Gate' Spin off shows on TV"
Hated for this to be over! I wish they made more Sci Fi like this!
"Too bad this fantasy couldn't continue.  Stargate Atlantis represented a good Sci Fi platform for delivering lessons, like good old Star Trek TOS."
"Culmination and unfortunately the last season.  Great ending.  Threw in some curve balls.  Significantly more action compared to the last 4 seasons.  Mikey dies, Ronan dies, but comes back.  McKay hooks up.  Teyla's baby grows.  Todd is in alot more episodes.  This does complete the series.  Still doesn't answer alot of questions, but the stories were never dull or boring.  There were so many different avenues, just like SG-1 could have taken, but in the end. . .one of the better closing finales."
"Spoilers included:This episode is unique, in my opinion. I'll state this now, in case I'm mixing up episodes. I have seen this but I'm reviewing after not having seen it in a while. So, don't be to hard.The whole idea of Teyla having an alteration to be a Wraith for the time being is really interesting. Especially how Todd manipulates events to his wants. I do enjoy Teyla's use of her authoritative position at the end where she warns Todd about her coming back in the event that he does something that she would not want him to. She can be very intimidating when she wants to be.I won't say much more, but I'll give good points on the creativity of the episode and the acting. Teyla, the actor playing her more specifically, did an excellent job. I can't imagine dealing with having to put all that make-up on.However, I'm going to stop there, as I'm not really one to delve into the actors themselves, other than to rate them as something along the lines of good or bad.Anyway, the episode was very good. It put Todd in a position of power whilst taking down the Queen. However, even though the Wraith to Human potion, as I'll call it, didn't get to go into place, I think it flows with the episodes. With it, it would cut the series short, and that would put a downer on our want for more.So, the Wraith war continues. Good episode. I hope people continue to enjoy the series.Just to note in ending, I'll apologize now if any of this information is out of place. As I pointed out in the beginning, I haven't watched this episode in a while. I wanted to write a review and give stars to this episode so that people would know it was good, instead of just seeing one star.Ok, hope you like the series."
This series deserves five stars. Season Five is the final season but unlike other series didn't let up on the storylines.  Each episode was worth the time to view it.Knight68
Not quite par with the original Stargate SG-1 in my book but this was a good spinoff series that carried its own weight and did well with the stories.  I thought it ended the series nicely too.  Some last episodes can try too hard but this one did a decent job.  Overall I enjoyed the series and the characters were strong and people you cared to know.  I will say they were a little annoying killing off some lead characters but other than that good.
Haven't received the DVD yet - it is due in June.Linda Sheean
Stargate Atlantis is one of my all time favorite series.  The cast is excellent and the plot takes a couple unexpected twists and turns that keep things interesting.  Just finished going through the series a second time and am sorry they didn't make one more season.
I just a fan of the Stargate franchise its just a shame that it didn't last longer maybe two more seasons but hey I enjoyed it while it lasted.
"Wish they had more seasons available. I am not sure they are filming more, but a great series! Excellent Si-Fi!"
"Love the Stargate series!  Started out watching SG-1 then onto Atlantis.  The acting is great and the visual effects are spectacular.  I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift because I got him hooked on the franchise.Can't wait to see Amanda Tapping join the cast and see how the chemistry is between them.  The special features are mostly non-exsistent in the first 3 so I'm wondering if it's better in the last two.  I really like special features and get into seeing the behind the scenes, deleted scenes, outtakes and the cast talking about themselves and the show.  Watching season 3 now!  Can't wait for Christmas to watch the others.  The packaging is very nice with a picture of the entire cast."
Another great season of a great show. Really wish it wasn't over. What an entertaining show with such a diverse cast of characters. Gotta love it
"Season five has fulfilled a lot of expectations  I had from the beginning.  While not tying everything in a neat package in the end, this one has loose ends.  Not enough to turn off those who stuck with the program for five seasons.  Rodney McKay, John Shepard and the rest, don't meet a terrible demise.  The show ends on a positive note. The evil Wraith, while not entirely finished, won't be bothering earth for some time.I recommend the program because it follows the tradition of SG-1 with a set of likable characters.  Woolsey, portrayed by Robert Picardo (of Star Trek Voyager ) does an incredible job as station captain.  It was good to see Colm Meany and the actor that portrayed the chief engineer on Enterprise in other roles.  I was glad to see Nicholas Pellegi (from the X-Files) in the role of a starship captain last all five seasons!What impressed me about this saga was the quality of the writing.  If only this studio was in charge of the Star Trek franchise!  They seem to be delivering much more in terms of action and dramatic possibilities.  There was more adventure in five years of Stargate: Atlantis than in seven years of Star Trek: Voyager.  The writers were fans of Star Trek and it shows in the writing.I wonder if they had to get permission from Paramount to use the beam up gimmick Trek utilizes so frequently? This show leaves open the possibility of a sequel or future films.  The last episode in paticular shows the fans there will be more in the future."
While the finale of the series could be call ambiguous it also left a decent ending that will still leave many fans of the series happy enough so there should be little disgruntlement felt by them.  This season saw the removal of Sam Carter as leader of Atlantis and the Representative of the IOA placed in charge though he isn't the puppet many expect him to be. Also we see a much stronger showing of some of the background characters which is appreciated especially since this is the final season I guess the writers and producers felt that those characters deserved that.  While we say goodbye to this sci-fi series which started weak but ended strong a sad farewell you can add this series to your other t.v. show dvd collection to watch again at your leisure and for the price very much worth it....
Love it! only wish the series would have continued and/or the made a movie! I liked the characters interaction and loyalty.
We really enjoyed this season as a family.  Their are a few episodes that are not as interesting as the others. The special effectts are good and the science fiction premise is also interesting.
"It's really sad that this is Atlantis' final season, as their stories are only getting better -- the writing is tighter, the characters developed and emotional.  Such drama was only bested by Galactica and Stargate SG1.Jennifer is taken over by a thief who was messing around with the same Ancient communication device that Daniel messed with when he discovered the Ori.  That lead to a huge story arc.  On Atlantis, it leads to attempted murder and possible loss of a loved one.Can't wait for future episodes.  I here there's a DVD movie coming.Stargate Atlantis - The Complete Seasons 1 and 2Stargate SG-1 - The Complete Series Collection"
"Terrific space opera, great CGI, good plot, lots of action, terrific villains, food for thought.  Also has lots of humor."
it's always a sad time when you reach the final season of characters you invested so much time in. Especially enjoyed the last two episodes the second to the last one reminded me of the Robert Rodriguez film in terms of the music that was used. there are numerous episodes that are more memorable than others. And of course some of these showcase the acting ability of each separate team member on the show.honestly think the corporate executive should turn loose of some mega bucks and start making movies based on the series the go deep into the various alien cultures that were shown the first 5 seasons
"I love the character of Monk and virtually everyone who watches it is also hooked on HIM.  Monk is a former San Francisco police department detective who had to go onto disability from the force because his OCD psychiatric disorder incredibly worsened after his wife was murdered by a fire bomb in her car.  On its face, this sounds like it could be offensive as it satirizes a mental disorder.  However, Monk is so lovable yet so aggravating with his OCD disorder that it works.  Monk now consults with the police department.  The reason he is such a good detective is because of his OCD.  He notices everything.  He is a fountain of information, including esoteric trivia, which he gravitates towards due to his illness.  Put it all together and he can reach amazing deductions although he drives everyone around him completely bats.Some viewers feared the series would suffer when the gal friday was replaced (from Sharona to Natalie) but there were no repercussions.  Monk is so totally the show, which everyone else revolves around, that the change caused barely a ripple.  As the series has gone on, it has evolved into more of a comedy and a character study which is also a mystery.  Monk always solves a murder but that is secondary to everything else going on.  Two characters I would miss are Leland Stotelmeyer, the Captain, and his sidekick Randy.  They have grown very funny in their own right and are the next strongest characters to Monk himself.  A month ago I rewatched every single episode of Monk and found myself every bit as fascinated with the episodes as I'd been the first time through.  If anything, I was even fonder of Monk this second viewing through.  Some excellent guest stars have also been on the series.  Gena Rowlands was on one episode in season 7 and she was magnificent with Monk.  I've read she's up for an Emmy for it.  John Turturro has also guest starred as Monk's brother and he was also wonderful.One loss to the show is that Monk's psychiatrist died (the actor in real life and thus the character on the show too).  This relationship had been building with every season and the two, Monk and shrink, were very good together.  Those pairings had been growing so it was a regular for them to have a session.  There were some great sessions between them with both insightful and comedic moments.  However, that is being soft pedaled now that a new shrink for Monk had to brought in.  This new shrink is ok but it is not the same.Tony Shalhoub plays Monk and he is wonderful.  The one thing the viewers would never accept is a new Monk.  He's said he thinks they should stop after season 8 (next season) but I hope he can be persuaded to do it a bit longer."
"Monk, Season Seven, arrived very quickly and in perfect condition.  I would buy more products from this seller in the future."
"Love Monk!! Great show,they should bring it back.It' hard to find great shows like Monk.Tony Shaloub is  amazing  in this show ."
Received the package in excellent condition.  Was excited to watch this season.  He is so very funny and indeed a message is being portrayed.
Every season of Monk just gets better and better. I never get enough. Monk is a character we can all identify with in one way or another!
Monk was a really good show. I have enjoyed all the seasons and I think this was one show that even got better as it went along.
As with any extended series the fringe characters get a lot of development and this is the case here.  Really adds a lot to the series.
"Monk's 7th is just as hilarious and entertaining as the previous seasons. Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders, with the help of his devoted Assistant, Natalie. Monk is forced to find a new therapist because Dr. Kroger has died. Throughout this season Monk matches wits with a chess player, helps a boxer, gets stuck on a submarine underwater, meets his other brother, fights City Hall, and much more. I highly recommend MONK: SEASON SEVEN!!!"
"Monk caught me from the very first episode. I love this show. Every episode, and I mean every episode is gold. This season is no different. It is a fantastic season, with Tony Shaloub at his very best. What a versatile actor he is. He seems to seamlessly fit into any part he attempts to do.  I have read some of the negative reviews of this season, and I have to say that the reviewers are missing the main points here, Monk is an evolving character leading up to a conclusive ending in December of 2010. Season 7, shows Monk getting away from the use of the wipes, every time he touches someone or something, this is huge. There are other steps toward interdependency as well. All leading up to the finale episodes when all is resolved for Adrian Monk.  I for one, prefer to see an ending to the TV shows I watch. Monk clearly has issues, that's what makes him so lovable as a character, but to see those issues reach a resolution by the ending of the series is what we as viewers want in a series. Season 7, has set up the parameters for those resolutions.  I believe that those who are seeing this in a negative light, need to reevaluate the show, the premise, and the character.Wasitchu"
"The video compilation reflects the original footage presented as 5 stars. Fascinating and horrifying . . . the absolute disregard for humankind  exhibited by the Nazi's is well documented. The Eastern Front presented not only a solution for the Jewish Question but for the extermination of those considered as 'unter menschhen.' Instead of hiding the facts, the Nazi indoctrination revels their  true purpose. There is the realization of what happened to prisoners of war and civilians alike. Only original footage can portray all the terrifying consequences to areas conquered by the Nazi war machine. Stalin's manner of treating German prisoners of war and even Russians taken prisoner by German forces is well documented. This series allows one to follow all the war atrocities as well as the sentiments of Stalin and Hitler. How to explain  the aberrant behavior can be found in recent genocide. Provocative and compelling with accurate information. The narration is typical of the propaganda/documentary films of that era. Unique footage and a more in depth presentation of prevailing 'ideology' than the usual overview. Recommended for beginners as well as those who are students of WWII history."
"Beats the hell out NYC blue. The only unbelievable thing is her high witch is showin in one of these. I have a brother who was a pilot now works for the FAC his job is qualifying pilots I quote &#34; Just like police work we have a high requirement we also have a weight requirement witch means if you are under 5'7&#34; forget it. If you are under 160 lbs forget it. You have to be able to put enough weigh on that brake to stop that plain. Just like in law enforcement you have to have it to take down felons.&#34; We also have x cops  in the family who agree and I went up for the job of police officer in San bernadino, Ca. and was funked out because I only weighted 140 lbs. With %'7&#34; that got me through, but did not have the weigh. Grace is 5'2&#34; accourding to the high board in the squad room . With cowboy boots on and she is nothing but skin muscles and bone. But I bet she still only weights about 100 lbs. LOL But she is a great actress. Just wish someone would give her a hair brush and tell her to use it. NO cop would get away with that mess she calls a hairdo. The closer was the same way, that and her horrable lipstick witch I commented on before it got called to her attention on that show.Oh well you have a love story the kind men and women die for. BUT in season 3 that great love that Ham feels for her and you think would flip her around has gone south for a preaty younger face. TO BAD."
"I watched all seasons, and then have come back to watch it again. The ensemble is great, and Holly Hunter is stellar! Love the writing, the acting, the cast, the stories, and the interweaving of Earl, the angel, and Grace the tough cop with a huge heart. I really like Oklahoma City as the setting; it's my part of the country, and the Texas/OU rivalry is handled beautifully. It is more than just another police drama. Some theological and philosophical, social and cultural dilemmas are included. Great show!"
"I started watching Saving Grace in the middle of the second season and I had to order the first season to catch up. Then I had to rewatch the second, its an awesome show of both crime solving but with a bit of an edge. It's funny and has a bit of a ""bad"" side, but in the good sence of the word.  It's great I fell in love with it after a few episodes."
Show is like an addictive drug. Once you start watching Saving Grace you will not be able to stop watching.
"Gritty, funny, even pushes at the idea of faith...the acting will knock your socks off. It's a shame this show only ran for three seasons- clearly too controversail for suburbia."
"Just as the sorrow I felt when &#34;The X-Files&#34; ended, I was sad to see Grace leave the stage. Holly Hunter is larger than life and every cast member filled their spaces with emotion, sincerity and clarity."
Great picture and audio quality and many episodes you feel like you are watching a feature length movie. I would recommend seeing this even if you are not a Science geek or SciFi fan
I have really enjoyed watching Eureka. The first to seasons introduced all of the key characters and a lot of the projects of the company that built the town. Season 3 brings several changes including that the children have grown older and graduated or advanced scientific minded teens. I love seeing the new projects and their results. The roles of Fargo and of Jo change. Excellent show. Very good imagination.
"This is a really fun Sci-Fi.  The characters are all well done.  When this show came out, my husband I always tried to watch but missed many episodes.  This is just the best way to watch your favorite series.  No interruptions and when you want to.  Love this show."
"great writing, the cast is terrific, whimsical and amusingthe storylines are interesting and the theoretical physics are...at least interestingone of the shows that starts and .... seems like 5 minutes later, it's overhave no clue (well $$) why they cut the last season out... but this is worth every second in my opinion"
Great program for the family no sex bad language or real violence good family show you must watch from season 1 to understand
"We enjoy Eureka because it is different than any other show on TV.  It has comedy, drama, suspense, and is a clean show that kids can watch too.  I would call it refreshing and interesting."
"Good writing, good acting, quirky plots. It is campy enough that the absurdity of the story line is hilarious. What's not to like?"
"I really hate sponsor product placement in movies. The ""Degree"" body deodorant is all over the episode, I get it okay, you want me to buy some deodorant, I already do, but it just looks stupid when I am supposed to imagine that this is a real ""GD"" ""Eureka"" secret genius town, and then you remind me with your Walmart Deodorant advertising, its stupid and annoying. Why cant they just have a list of sponsors at the end of the episode for someone who actually gives damn?"
"Overall has most of my favorite episodes. It's hard to explain, but there is something about the cast of characters and how they interact that is very believeable despite the unreal events they cope with. The acting is sincere, and we know the foibles and quirks of the characters which makes the epidsodes more fun. I think I like &#34;Insane in the P Brane&#34; best of all.  The two scientists on either side of a scientific breakthrough, unknown to them, but one thinks he's hearing his mother from the after life is done very well. I miss my Eureka &#34;friends&#34;."
the first three and most of the forth was great but it kind of fell apart kind of lost what made it a great show to start with.
My husband likes it. It's science fiction I  personality  do not go for shows like this.  This show is on his favorite list  if I am busy he puts this on cause he knows I do not care for it. If you like science fiction you will like rhis
Like to watch on Kindle late in evening. Funny and yet addictive. Like the characters in it and stories are pretty enterning.
"Eureka is fun science fiction.  Elements of current science are woven into catastrophic happenings that the cast of characters always finds a way to solve.  The scene is set on earth in a small science town populated mostly by scientific geniuses. They live relatively normal lives compared to lots of other science fiction, and that is part of the appeal. Elements of romance are woven into the stories, comic relief at times.  Wish someone would decide to reactivate the series with a Eureka Two series."
We really enjoyed Eureka. Has all the right ingredients for our type of Sci - Fi..comedy and drama with some thought provoking ideas thrown in. It's ashamed this series was cancelled while lesser shows survive.
Great show.  Great acting.  Great scenarios and story lines.  Always a lot of fun.  Will be sorry when I'm at the end of the series.  Luckily still have a a couple seasons left.
"Loved the series it was just pure fun to watch, no bad language very little sex andI really liked the way it ended,"
"Quirky, but awesome.  This puts a new perspective in the meaning of Government experimentation at the cost of human comedy."
Mixture of events in Eureka life.  New boss with personal agenda and on the personal side there are interesting developments in love.  And of course the &#34;dull&#34; scientific/technological events to keep everyone busy...
I have thoroughly enjoyed this series - and this 3rd season was just as entertaining as the previous 2.  I really love that I don't have to sit through endless commercials and can watch whenever I want to watch.
"What a wonderful show.(All seasons)  It's Science Fiction made fun.  Everyone would enjoy this show.  It's mostly humor, not serious science fiction."
Great show absolutely love this series I hope it continues to stay this good. I would love for this show to stay on for years to come.
"Great mix of sifi, detective work, and comedy to give light entertaiment to a small but unsual town. Watch it!"
Not much to review. Quicker than expected delivery a plus.  And a great season of HIMYM.
"After years of what felt like a collection of stale broadcast TV sitcoms, I was introduced to How I Met Your Mother. While I've never been a big fan of any particular sitcom, this show got me excited about the genre for the first time ever. I was introduced to it by my sister, who brought a borrowed copy of the third season on DVD home with her from college. I ended up watching a few episodes and was very pleasantly surprised by How I Met Your Mother -- it was absolutely hilarious. While I always thought that sitcoms were just full of overly used jokes and cardboard characters, How I Met Your Mother was not only funny and fresh, but felt like it had more depth than the typical sitcom. I was hooked.How I Met Your Mother has a unique storytelling style that continues into season four. The overarching story is being told by an older Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) to his children. The series consists of a series of flashbacks from Ted's 20s and 30s about the lives of himself and his friends living in New York City and, ultimately, how he met his future wife. This frame may seem complex, especially if you haven't tuned in from the beginning, but it's done in a breezy, comfortable manner that feels natural and doesn't confuse viewers. I felt like it was a story that my father could have been telling me because sometimes there are flashbacks within the overarching flashback and scenes and timing are not perfectly linear, which is more like how a person would share memories -- as they are triggered by something else, rather than chronologically.In season four, the gang continues to mature as they enter their 30s. Ted successfully proposes to Stella (Sarah Chalke), but is left at the altar. Ted fights to come to terms with it, and later reenters the dating scene after becoming roommates with ex-girlfriend Robin (Cobie Smulders). Ted is later laid off from his job, and he decides to begin his own architecture firm. Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) struggles with growing feelings for Robin. While Barney continues his usual womanizing ways, tension grows between him and Robin as Barney's feelings start to come out. Meanwhile, Marshall (Jason Segel) and Lily (Alyson Hannigan) move into their new apartment and struggle with whether or not they're ready to have children. Each character's world changes throughout the series, building up for more antics in season five.The cast of How I Met Your Mother does a perfect job of playing off one another, making the jokes and punch lines feel snappy and well-utilized. While many comedies run the risk of overdoing jokes, How I Met Your Mother does a fantastic job of balancing the joke surrounding an episode with all of the characters. By far, the best (and most hilarious) character in this show is the awe-(wait for it...)-some Barney Stinson with his unnamed corporate job, endless supply of suits, and constant bedding of various women. Barney is always up to something off-the-wall and funny, no matter what's happening in the lives of the other characters.The season four DVD set includes all 24 episode on three discs in widescreen format with English 5.1 Dolby Surround sound plus English, French, and Spanish subtitles -- not to mention a great selection of bonus features. These features include a recap of season three, episode commentaries, a gag reel, ""A Night with Your Mother"" special featuring an Academy of Television Arts & Sciences panel discussion, a hilarious gag video about how awesome Barney is, and an extended scene from ""The Fight.""Season four is another great chapter in the How I Met Your Mother saga. The series is just as humorous as when it first began, and the characters continue to be interesting and funny. The amazing thing for me about this series is how it can cover such a range of emotions in just one episode. I don't usually respond to TV or movies emotionally, but How I Met Your Mother can make me roll around laughing and takes me to the brink of tears in the same episode. I can't wait for the new season to start."
"How I Met Your Mother in Season Four is just as good as the first three seasons with some really interesting and funny episodesA major part of the season deals with Ted and Stella's relationship after they get engaged. Ted has a problem when Stella wants him to move to New Jersey and the gang tries to talk him out of moving. As the wedding draws near Ted tells Stella that he invited Robin and Stella gets mad because she does not want a significant ex to be at the wedding so Ted invites Tony, Stella's ex. This turns out to be not a good idea as it turns out that Stella gets back with Tony.Barney deals with his feelings for Robin in Season 4. He is jealous at Ted because after coming back from Japan Robin lives with Ted for a while. While living with him they become friends wit benefits so that their bad habits wont get on each others nerves.Barney helps Robin though by making her a great audition tape that gets her a job as an anchor for a 4 am show. He also helps Marshall get a job as in house council at GNC (the bank he works for.)Marshall and Lilly are debating on wither or not they should have a baby.Near the end of the season Ted runs into Stella and Tony who help him find a job. During this time Tony breaks up with Stella, but eventually work things out. Tony and Stella and move to California where a few years after Tony writes a screen play about the triangle that gets made into a popular movie. Tony also helps Ted get a job as a professor at the local university and the season ends with Ted telling his kids that their mom was in his class."
"This series just keeps getting better and better, love the characters and the situational comedies, the cast has a great sense of timing and the writers are keeping it fresh....."
"season 4 has some of the most outrageous and downright hilarious story lines. This show never gets old and I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a good laugh. I own seasons 1-7 and i can always go back, watch them, and stilllaugh like I never saw them before."
"I don't know how they do it. Each season just keeps getting funnier and more twisted. I don't care how much time they take between seasons, it's worth it. Everyone on this show cracks me up and I have no idea how far each episode is going to go. This is one of the best comedies I've ever seen."
"I can't get enough of &#34;It's Always Sunny.&#34; This is pure genius hilarity. I could watch these guys everyday, all day for the rest of my life."
BY FAR - The funniest episode in &#34;It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.&#34;  It's not just the main story but the subplot of Dee trying to create her own Sex and the City 'girls club' is hilarious.
"I'll be completely honest, this season is absolutely awesome, I don't care what anyone else says. Every season of this show has been exciting and it has been almost impossible to stop watching.Season 4 is charged with heavy emotions. The events since season 1 are finally taking their toll, especially with Scofield who is a good person at heart but blames himself for so many of the things that have gone wrong. Burrows gets to be even more of a bad-@$$ and is obviously done playing games. Things never get dull or boring in this season.The unfortunate thing about this season is that it's the last one. Fortunately, they releasedPrison Break: The Final Breakto bring things to a close. This is definitely one of my all time favorite shows."
"I loved this series, I remember when it first started and my daughter was hooked on it, I didn't think I would like it.  Then it came to Amazon Prime and I fell in love with it.....okay lots of holes in the plot and lots of issues with logic, but it is still a good watch."
This season was better than season 3 which was boring as hell. Brought back  a lot of players from the first 2 seasons and got rid of a boring person from the third season. This show had good twists and a shocking ending. Wrapped everything up nicely.Overall a good series.
The DVD arrived on time and is in great condition.  I would recommend this seller and definitely use again.
"But I still love this show, it was one of my favorites when it was originally on the air.Something about prison shows I have always enjoyed them.They had a good cast, and a good back story to work on.If I hadn't been watching here on Amazon I never would have known there was a &#34;Final Break&#34; then I had never seen.Of course they don't include that in Prime, but I did go out and find a copy."
"WHAT DO YOU SAY TO NBC, WHEN THEY CUT A SHOW ABOUT AVERAGE PEOPLE, WHO ARE NOT RICH AND FAMOUS. BUT THAN AGAIN NBC CAN PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR, MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGES THAN THE REST OF US GET. BUT WHEN WE LIKE A PROGRAM LIKE ""MY NAME IS EARL"" AND MAYBE ONE OF NBC'S CEO WIFE, OR KIDS DON'T LIKE THE SHOW, IT GETS CUT OFF.WELL, I LIKED MY NAME IS EARL,IT MADE ME LAUGH. IT SHOWED HOW PEOPLE LIVE THEIR LIFE DAY TO DAY LIKE HOW MY NEIGHBORSLIVE.  WELL, I AM SAD TO SAY, I DO NOT WATCH TV ANY MORE NBC, BECAUSE WHEN YOU GOT A DIAMOND IN YOUR HANDS, YOU START LOOKING FOR A BIGGER DIAMOND. THERE IS A LITTLE DIAMOND ON MY FINGER AND IT MAKES ME HAPPY TO HAVE IT. NBC, PEOPLE NEED TO LAUGH, AND LAUGH SO HARD THAT THEY START TO CRY FROM LAUGHING.  DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT? WITH SO MUCH GOING ON IN THIS WORLD THAT GOD CREATED FOR US. THERE IS SO MUCH B.A.D. THINGS HAPPENING AND IT GETS VERY SAD. BUT, I AM THANKFUL TO AMAZON.COM FOR PRIME TIME, I CAN WATCH EARL AGAIN. GOOD BYE NBC AND GOD BLESS AMAZON.COM AND THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE FOR ME AND ALL THE OTHER AMAZON.COM CUSTOMERS.  I LOVE YOU AMAZON.SINCERELY YOURS, GEORGIA A. MORRISON-FLORES"
"Being a fan of Betty White's, I'm happy that they brought my beloved Golden Girl to the show.  She makes an excellent, crazy, and horrifying witch lady.  I hope I've seen all the episodes now.  I recall a few months earlier when I was surfing TV late night when I saw Betty White in the description for this show.  I've been hooked on it ever since.  TBS re-aired the episode, so hopefully I'm now all caught up.  Too bad that the show was cancelled fairly early on.  I really did like the simple lessons that Earl gave.Honorable mention: I love Nescobar-A-Lop-Lop name.  It always puts a smile on my face.Earl is just as naive as ever in this episode.Joy is just as bitchy as ever.Darnel is just as ""nice"" as ever.Randy is just as simple as ever.Kenny is just as gay as ever.Catalina is just as cuckoo as ever.and ex-deputy Mike is just as lackadaisical as ever.I love the creativity of the writers - this show is hilarious with all the funny flashbacks.  Don't drink the tea!"
"Very funny. Don't understand why no longer on. Got better as seasons went on.  Remember carma will get ya. She can be a B, If you know what I mean"
This show does not disappoint! I continue to root for Booth and Bones in all aspects of their lives! Great show! Season 4 is an excellent season!!!
"Season 3 as a whole, especially its ending, was just a bit short of a disaster, with its device for having Eric Millegan's character, Zach Addy leave the series, as the totally improbable assistant of the cannibalistic Gormagon master. The two episode opener for season 4 is a very nice twist, putting the series back on track, with Booth and Brennan both giving lectures in London, and are called in to assist in the investigation of an American's murder.The sub-plot with Brennan's father (Ryan O'Neal) becomes a bit more interesting, although that thread in the ongoing story never caught my interest. Another rather dull thread is the effort to have Angela's husband from the South Pacific sign divorce papers, so Angela and Hodgins can get married.True to the theme in the opening two episodes, it seems as if Booth and Brennan spend a lot of time away from the lab. One especially tense and entertaining episode has Booth and Brennan solving a murder while on a plane to China, which they must do as long as the plane is in the air, and still sovereign U.S. soil. Another story traces the victim to Norway, and Sweets is a big help in solving the case. In fact, in seasons 3 and 4, Sweets is a more serious character than he becomes in later seasons with his entanglement with one of Brennan's assistants, Daisy.The season also ends with a bang, with an episode based entirely on a dream, in which all the actors, including returning Eric Millegan, and all other regular and recurring characters appear as characters not their own, and Brennan and Booth are married."
I have watched this show every week on tv.  It is such a good show with some comedy and drama both in it.  I now have seasons 1-4 and plane to watch them at a later time.
"As my friends told me, the show would get better as it went along, and so far I have to agree.  The show is very well done, and there are several episodes that I thought were particularly entertaining (some good laughs).  The corpses sometimes are still very graphic, gross and disgusting, and sometimes things get a little too technical, but it is still an excellent show.This DVD set has several extras and it does have subtitles for the hearing impaired.  I hope the quality of the show continued in the other seasons, which I am looking forward to watching.  (I do not have cable or satellite, and only buy DVD's.)"
I started watching reruns of this show. I got hooked on it and had to add it to my small collection.
"Season four feels almost like a reboot to the franchise. New cast members, new locations, very interesting stories, and even an alternate reality makes an appearance. I think this is my favorite season of Bones. Thank you to the writers, directors, actors and everyone else who made season four possible!"
"as awesome as ever, look forward to each and every episode.  Going to have the husband buy me the complete season for Christmas"
"What can you say? Bones has excellent characters,actors, and writers.  Stories are nice mixture of humor and drama, not your normal procedural crime show.  The most gruesome corpses on TV.  Great!"
"It's that vaunted chemistry and the rich emotional content, and it's those terrific touches of humor. In ""The Perfect Pieces in the Purple Pond"" there's a great throwaway moment brought about by a publisher's crediting part of Temperance Brennan's success as a mystery author to her looks. Brennan decides to quit writing, and here's Booth talking fast to change her mind:- Brennan: ""I don't want to be a sexy scientist!""- Booth: ""Well, that's like me saying I don't want to be a sexy FBI Agent. We can't change who we are!"" And then Booth starts quoting a published review of one of her mysteries. One of those perfect throwaway moments.World-renowned forensic anthropologist Temperance ""Bones"" Brennan is as brusque and tactless as ever, as confounded by the subtleties of social decorum as ever (or as Sweets exclaims: ""She is wicked literal!""). Bones is still very much that intimidating icy intellect, still a wounded soul, and still solving murders. FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth is still the one with the people skills and that well-developed bump of intuition. More onions are peeled in this season as we learn even more about the underpinnings of our core characters. The absolute big draw of this show is that sizzle between David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel, their fabulous interplay tantalizing and frustrating the viewers. Could this be the season that they get together? Well, kind of, sort of. Taking what the show is giving, I wallow in their ever evolving relationship.Staying on the personal, Hodgins and Angela are trying to move past their break-up. ""The Skull in the Sculpture"" demonstrates that Angela is more ready to move on than Hodgins, and if you thought Angela was a free spirit before, well, now...  This episode also has Sweets demonstrating the best way ever to fire someone. Young FBI psychologist Lance Sweets, by the way, becomes a regular cast member in this season, and I like him more and more as each episode progresses, even if Booth and Bones continually treat him like a pesky little brother. Even Dr. Saroyan's past is delved into.Zack Addy, apprentice to the Gormagon Killer, has been institutionalized, which doesn't keep him from strolling out to help the squints on a baffling case. Still, this gives rise to a running theme, that of the rotating roster of interns as Saroyan and Bones attempt to fill Zack's spot, and the fun thing is that each of these interns comes with baggage. There's the morbid one, the excessively chirpy one, the one constantly dispensing trivia, etc. The most martyred one may well be that repressed intern who insists on keeping things professional at all times - except that, the squints being a tight bunch, he keeps getting exposed to a deluge of innuendo and gossip in the workplace.***Possible plot SPOILERS begin***There isn't really a running mystery arc to tie these episodes together - no one like the Gormagon Killer running around, for example. But that doesn't mean that the cases aren't gripping; some of them are really interesting. The season opens with ""Yanks in the U.K."" (or, as I like to call it, ""Booth Vs. England""), which plants Brennan and Booth in jolly old England, investigating a murder and running into a British version of themselves. In ""The Passenger in the Oven"" Bones and Booth are on a flight bound to China and have only four hours to solve a murder before the plane lands and Booth loses jurisdiction. ""Double Trouble in the Panhandle"" has Booth and Bones infiltrating the Big Top as ""Buck & Wanda and their Knives of Death,"" and their circus act is actually fraught with more suspense than in just about any other scene in this season.Some other favorites? In ""The Double Death of the Dearly Departed,"" Bones and Booth steal a corpse due for cremation from a funeral home, Bones believing that the body had been ""translated,"" which is Booth's made-up code for murder. ""Mayhem on a Cross"" unveils some dark stuff about Sweets' past, this episode also featuring the return of the awesome Stephen Fry as FBI shrink Gordon Gordon Wyatt. It also had me cracking up whenever Bones insisted on correctly pronouncing ""skalle"" (the Norwegian word for ""skull""). ""The Hero in the Hold"" features the return of the Grave Digger serial killer. ""The Princess and the Pear"" plonks Bones and Booth's temp replacement in the world of comic book conventions, and Bones finally gets another chance to flash her martial arts mojo.In ""The Critic in the Cabernet"" Bones drops a bomb on Booth and Booth gets advice from a cartoon character, a frivolous conceit which goes on to have a terrifying payoff. Finally Season 4 closes with a quirky fantasy episode featuring a re-shuffling of roles. In this reality, Dr. Saroyan and Booth's brother are homicide detectives and Booth and Bones are a married couple who run a nightclub and who end up as suspects in a murder case. It's neat that just about everyone is in this one.***Possible plot SPOILERS end now***BONES - SEASON FOUR comes in six discs and includes 22 of the 26 episodes. The bonus features are: extended scenes for three episodes: ""The Perfect Pieces in the Purple Pond,"" ""The Doctor in the Den,"" & ""The Girl in the Mask""; 2 deleted scenes (one in ""The Skull in the Sculpture,"" the other in ""The Passenger in the Oven,"" both featuring Angela and Hodgins having a conversation about Roxie); 5 and a half minutes of bloopers (""Skalle!""); ""Androgeny: Playing Haru Tanaka"" - guest actress Ally Maki delves into her dubiously gendered character (""Dr. Haru Tanaka"") in ""The Girl in the Mask""; and ""Squints in Training"" - this segment, which includes cast interviews, goes into this season's cast of recurring lab interns. Again no episode commentaries or cast interviews. Also, note that Season Four's first four episodes (""The Yanks in the UK, Parts 1 & 2,"" ""The Man in the Outhouse,"" & ""The Finger in the Nest"") are absent here, having instead been inserted inBones: The Complete Third Seasonas that set's featured bonus features.By the way, in the Grossest Corpse of the Season department, it's a tie between ""The Cinderella in the Cardboard"" and ""The Science in the Physicist."" Icky!"
Pretty much the same show so if you liked the other 3 seasons than you will like this season as well
"This fourth season is the season of all come-backs. The attempt to bring Zack back, but that is too artificial in a way, does not work beyond one single episode. Of course he is particularly brilliant but with this brilliancy that is so bright it dazzles us. We need someone more evanescent in this laboratory, someone who is never the same and always a come-back again on some rotating basis. So the extra lab-worker is the ever going project to bring back someone that cannot be brought back, hence the character that can experiment all kinds of profiles: English, Japanese, simple intern or certified doctor of something, Moslem or happily paired with a woman and not interested in the constant sexual innuendo in this lab, etc.The second come-back is that of Temperance's father as some kind of museum science guide for visiting children. That one is hard on Temperance who considers her father as a criminal and has not yet forgiven him for abandoning her when a teenager in the custody of her unworthy brother who left and sent her to a foster home in a way. But that ex-science teacher has the knack it takes to have contact with young teenagers and make them like what is in many ways forbidding and austere, or at least can be if you do not know how to make it an adventure. He is a genial awakener for Agent Booth's son Parker and Temperance has to yield to that demand.The third come-back is the British psychologist but in a less flashy role now his barbecue is built. His main role is to set Dr Sweets, the FBI profiler, in perspective, a Dr Sweets who is so shy and so flippantly uncatchable. But he is so efficient and efficacious with the criminals who have to be discovered and caught.The next come-back is that of the Gravedigger, and this time for the finish of that case. The grave-digger manages to kidnap Agent Booth himself and to bury him in a navy ship just before it is blown down into the sea by the navy itself. The point that appears little by little is that the gravedigger has inside information and must be from inside the justice department or the FBI or some other Home Security agency. And that's how they find out that serial killer. At the other end Agent Booth experiences a comeback of a completely different nature. On the ship, while he is trying to escape he is helped by some ghost from deep in his mind, the corporal who was killed practically in his own arms and who he took back to base. Strange come-back but quite natural for all of us: we find help in someone in our minds who makes us keep our cool and find the way out.Then we move to the come-back of Agent Booth's younger brother who is a pain in the back because he is not able to do anything right without the help of his brother and he fails in some situations systematically just to get that help. A come-back and a good-bye too since he goes to India for a motorbike tour, but alone without his big brother. Good riddance in a way and good morning Vietnam in another. But the little boy has to grow one day.The best of this series remains the vast array of cases that bring up a vast selection of social and cultural situations that are all explored in some fine details revealing the horror of this society of ours. Of course there are a lot of winks to other series in the genre. The main wink is to Stephen King who once wrote: ""If you can't terrify your audience, then horrify them. And if you can't horrify them, then gross them out."" And you can be sure the cadavers, corpses, bodies, bones and other dead remnants of human beings are gross to the utmost. We can of course see here and there an allusion to Dexter, or another one to Crime Scene Investigation. But the style is original and personal.This season finally is very rich to reveal the deeper selves of the characters, with some strange a priori idea that Dr Temperance Brennan, Dr Lance Sweets or Agent Seeley Booth, just like Dr Zack Addy have had a youth of suffering and want on the loving side of life. And that would be why they are great in their present positions. That's too easy. And the characters that are kept in second position like Dr Camille Saroyan, Dr Jack Hodgins or Angela Montenegro cannot qualify at that level.  In other words it is a clich&eacute; that one can only be great if they have suffered in their infancy and youth. But it definitely gives the characters some density on the screen.The last episode is a complete reversal due to some brain tumor and I must say Temperance as the manageress of a club that has more to do with a brothel and an opium den than with a caf&eacute; is quite a change of perspective.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID"
As always Bones delivers intrigue and suspense. The dynamics of the cast makes this show work as no others and the characters are so believable in their roles that they just &#34;must&#34; be those people off camera! I love this show and hope that it runs forever.
I am a very loyal fan of this series I love the humor of watching someone with out emotions try to be normal around highly emotional people and situations plus the gore is great
Ok why do we have to wait so long not just for Bones but all the other DVD TV series on a yearly basis? We don't get paid for TV here and so depend on the series by DVD arrivals. Of course we then scarf them up so quick within less than a week usually...it's one heck of a long wait for next years episodes. Yes we occasionally sneak peaks via the free net viewers in 2 x 3 frames but that only wets the appetite and our impatience even more. So if anyone is listening that decides these dates.....why not put them out within a 2-3 week ending of the season? Meantime the show...BONES is by far our favorite. I didn't like it for the first original 3 episodes but the 4th began to thaw me and by the 5th I was hooked. Writing is tight and casting tighter. Love the comedy most of all. Sure they could improve this or that to make me like it even more...but hey life is a compromise.If you gave this a try when it first came out but wasn't taken in...go back and give it another look. I wasn't quite taken by last years plot of making Zack a serial killer. That definitely weird for weirds sake. Nothing like writing a character off without exactly killing him off traditionally. I never warmed to Zacks character...so I don't miss him or feel for his persona living behind those cold cold bars:) Hope it runs another 5 years......or more.....
I bought this for my sister as she is now a bones follower and does not have the whole collection and little by little she is getting it and I am helping  yeah....
You can really see by now that Booth and Brennan are made for each other. They can't help but get together real soon. The episodes are so good you get addicted!
Bones are the best series and if you like crime and love storys then this is the best series for you
I have all of the current seasons and I can't stop loving this show!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys procedurals and doesn't mind seeing dead bodies on TV.
The only way I can keep up with the show is to get the seasons. I work overseas and am able to keep up this way.
"I just discovered Bones and like Prisonbreak and 21, didn't watch the weekly series.  I like to begin from scratch and watch all the episodes in a marathon.  Bones doesn't disappoint and in my opinion, there were few episodes that did not appeal to me.  Highly recommend."
Here in this season we really got some weird cases but the characters were developing even more.  You got to learn more about their backgrounds before they all got together.
i have always been a fan of hero's.  very entertaining i think kinda like watching a marvel movie.  you gotta see this show.
family love to sit down and watch this together. Love Hiro! Kids really enjoy the show as well as us adults!
Watching Season Three got me hooked on the series again.  I recently also purchased Season 4.  I will get 5 & 6 at a later date.
"heroes, sylar, science fiction, science fiction tv, season 3, zachary quinto, powers, marvel comics, hero"
If you don't keep up with each and every episode ... you totally lose the whole spectrum of what is going on in this series ... but I am hooked !
"Who is on who's team?  It is kind of like some reality show, where everyone is creating alliances.  A Fantastic view of history,  what happened in the beginning that we did not know about, and it makes more sense now.  Great so far,  can not wait to see more."
"i don't know why i was so invested in these characters, but it was cool to watch them grow through the volumes"
"I love this series. It is science fiction, good guys, bad guys, and is full of surprises. It is well written and well acted. All of these ingredients are rare to find in any show, let alone science fiction. I never knew this show existed. It has been a great surprise. Quality entertainment. It does not take place in the same boring settings every show. Not your typical TV series."
It had action suspense at times it was funny I would recommend this to everyoneYou should watch it from the beginning
love the show. wish it was still on but love being able to watch anytime I want too love it
Wish they would have more shows like this. Networks have moved away from si-Fi for some reason. Nothing on network TV worth watching.
"I just love the series Heroes and have all of their seasons, it a great TV Show which I highly recommendpeople to see it! But to Understand it, you will have to start out watching the Seasons in order i.e. do notwatch season 2 without watching season 1 First, or you will have problems figuring out who's the good guysand who's the bad guys!  Same thing with season 3!"
"I saw this show on amazon prime instant video list, checked it out and immediately got involved in the entire 4 seasons!!  Did some binge watching, to be honest...I really enjoyed this series, it was amusing in spots--esp. Hiro and Ando and their escapades!  Season 4 had potential but apparently the writers knew the ax was eminent and while there were good episodes, just wasn't up to par with the first 3 seasons--but I know you will want to watch it once you see the other shows!  It's good entertainment, for sure!"
"Be sure to watch this if you are a fan of science fiction or even say comic book story lines. Awesome action and great twists and turns too. On my &#34;Bucket list&#34; of things to watch, this was in the top five."
"I have to admit that I stand corrected. After Michael and Pam left Dunder-Mifflin last week, I was seriously concerned for the future of the show. I just couldn't see a world where Michael wasn't doing some kind of crazy, unproductive thing around the office while Pam and Jim play pranks on Dwight. However, in ""Dream Team,"" we were treated to something surprisingly entertaining and funny.The Michael Scott Paper company officially begins in Michael's condo. Michael puts together a ""dream team"" of people to kick things off. We finally get to see what happened to Ryan after he got out of prison for fraud and, it seems, returns to the cast for good. Michael and his team set out to find investors for their fledgling company, but run into trouble when it becomes clear that Michael has no clear idea what his company is or where its going. One of the dream team members jumps ship while Pam convinces Michael to continue with the company. Together, Michael, Pam and Ryan move into open office space in the same building as Dunder-Mifflin.Meanwhile, Jim makes a bad impression on his new boss, Charles, while Andy continues his usual brown-nosing antics. In order to change the Charles's view of him, Jim lies about his soccer-playing abilities. This leads to an office-wide soccer game where Dwight spends the entire time trying to expose Jim's lie.While there isn't too much screen time back at good old D-M, Michael and co. get much-needed time to play off one another. The ending does get a little serious, even for The Office, but the rest of the episode is so funny that it works. I found myself laughing out loud several times -in fact, more often than I have in recent Office episodes."
"""The Office"" is one of the most brilliant comedy series on TV. Steve Carell is inimitable as Michael Scott; Rainn Wilson is hilarious as the self-centered Dwight. The entire ensemble cast is strong. The whole cast WORKS TOGETHER... in more ways than one.In the fifth season, the new boss Charles (Idris Elba, before he hit it big inObsessed).... so Michael Scott goes off on his own to form the Michael Scott Paper Company. There are hilarious shenanigans involving a bus from a Korean church, square-shaped pancakes, going to a senior investment club. There's the growing romance between Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) Dwight is constantly plotting... to the point of suggesting bees. At the company picnic, Michael hooks up with his ex Holly and they do a cheesy skit about the history of their company based onSlumdog Millionaire.""The Office"" is worth the work!"
"Nice wrap up to the ""Michael going on his own"" mini-adventure. Reestablishes the relationship among all the staff. A great funny episode with just the right combination of seriousness and levity. A must have."
"I am new to The Office and have been watching seasons 1-5 in succession.  It has been fun to watch the development of the program and the characters.  If you have worked in a corporate environment, you will especially empathize with this show.  My friend who works in government finds more synergy withParks & Recreation: Season One-- I love this show too!The Office is extremely politically incorrect at times so you need to keep that in mind.  If you can laugh at that and yourself, you should enjoy the show.  Season 5 was no exception.  Very, very funny and a great job at developing the characters just a little more.5 Stars.  I love it!"
"As the series progresses, this show gets increasingly better.  I know I'm writing this synopsis &#34;late in the game&#34;, so to speak, but the show is not the same without Steve Carell."
"This is a great season. I am a huge Office fan and this season is one of my favorites. Not quite seasons 2-4, but still really good.SPOILER ALERT:This is the season you find out that Pam is pregnant, and i believe it is the season Pam and Jim get engaged. So one of the best sitcom love stories in recent memory climaxes in this season. For that plot development alone it is worth the purchase."
"Wooosh! 26 episodes (two of them with 44 minutes), almost 5 minutes of deleted scenes by episode, very good packaging.All this is amazing, but would not be enough if the episodes themselves were not great. They are! They are some of the best ever of the show. Unfortunately, towards  the ending of the season we have some usual plot devices for sitcoms (or any other shows), I would not give any spoilers, but the final part of the last episode was so cliched (although shown in the usual Office way). I did not expect that.This season is very good indeed. Dwight is out of control. In my opinion, someone clearly decided to give all the characters more evenly distributed screen time, and it shows. All in all, you cannot lose by watching it."
"After watching four seasons of ""The Office"", what I was consistently amazed at was the show's ability to stray away from the formula in order to cultivate new territory. For example, during a large portion of the third season Jim and Pam (the emotional backbone of the show) are separated and lose that incredible chemistry. However, that separation ends up bringing in the Andy Bernard character, who has been a wonderful addition to the show.This fifth season did much of the same. It started off great, especially when Michael Scott finds a new employee, Holly, who catch match him step for step in the craziness department. Each episode contains at least one absolutely hilarious moment (and some come once every few seconds!), even despite the fact that the ""same old"" cast is back again. However, as the seasons approaches roughly the 2/3rds mark, there are some major changes that take place, primarily for Michael and Pam Beasley. This creates a run of 5-6 episodes that, to be honest, just aren't as hilariously funny as the rest of them (as Jim Halpert's character cannot hold the show in lieu of Michael).However, as they so often do, the writers take that disturbing change and eventually make it work out for the better, as the emotional sides of many of ""The Office"" workers are touched on more than ever before, what with all the changes occurring. When the show finally gets back to its original pattern/format, it feels like slipping into that old familiar spot on the couch again...you might take it for granted while you have it, but removing it from your life will just want it back that much more!Thus, I once again give this season of ""The Office"" my highest approval for its ability to be incredibly funny and still develop characters in a meaningful way."
"There is so much to love about 30 ROCK but incredibly the best part is the funniest comedic actor working in tv today, Alec Baldwin.  There were a few hints that he might have this comedic ability: his stints guesting on SNL as host and his semi comedic turn as the dim witted con in MIAMI BLUES. Nevertheless, one is hard pressed to reconcile his comedic portrayal as the head of NBC with the actor who opened GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS with the historic ""closing is for closers"" soliloquy. For three seasons though I have laughed and laughed as his character has only expanded and gotten funnier.  This is especially amazing considering he is sharing screen time with some of SNL's biggest alumni.  Tina Fey does a fabulous writing job and is excellent as everyone's hard pressed straight woman Liz Lemon.  Fey plays the head writer of a tv show which is just like SNL.  She stands between her staff of writers and comedians and the head of programming, Jack, played by Baldwin.  Her writers and comedians are to a person barely sane on a daily basis. The other three supporting characters are Tracy and Jenna as competing comedic costars on Lemon's show and Kenneth, a page at NBC, who as a hick from the sticks is a foil for everyone else's urbanity.  I think Tracy and Jenna were originally intended to be bigger than Jack/Baldwin on the show but Baldwin had little trouble upstaging them in short order.  All three spin around him and Liz Lemon and as supporting characters they are excellent.  I've seen all three seasons .  For me it replaced the huge gap left by the end of FRASIER and  SEINFELD."
"""30 Rock"", the NBC sitcom that has the most Emmy Awards (22) for a single year for a comedy series.  An award-winning series that is critically acclaimed series that in its first and second year, despite being a series that critics raved about, the series has had its challenge due to its low viewership.Fortunately, NBC has supported this series and greenlighted a fourth season because ""30 ROCK"" is unique and one of those rare delights that is on network television.  Humorous, entertaining but literally, just a fantastic comedy that has solid writing and a talented cast.30 Rock is the shortened address of where NBC Studios is located in New York City, ala 30 Rockefeller Plaza.

But Liz's boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin, ""Knots Landing"", ""Beetlejuice"", ""Pearl Harbor"") decides to add comedian Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan, ""Saturday Night Live"", ""Scare Tactics"") to spice up the show and rename it ""TGS with Tracy Jordan"".The show focuses on what goes behind-the-scenes of the creation of the show and what is going on in the personal lives of several of the main characters (primarily focusing on the lives of Liz Lemon and Jack Donaghy) and focuses on relationships and the unique friendship that Jack and Liz tend to develop, while the two deal with their own love life but also their interaction with the writers of TGS and the NBC Page Kenneth Parcell (Jack MacBrayer, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", ""Arrested Development"").""30 ROCK - Season 3' features 22 episodes on three discs.  Included are (spoilerless summaries):DISC: 1* EPISODE 37 - DO-OVER - Liz wants to adopt but must must please the adoption evaluator (guest star Megan Mullally, ""Will & Grace"").

The third season showed no signs of slowdown and every episode, you just want to laugh because the characters are hilarious but most of all, the writing is just top notch.  And all 22 episodes in the third season does not disappoint at all.With the second season DVD release from last year, the show was really facing major challenges as the Writers Guild Strike really cut down on the episodes and no one knew if NBC was going to cancel the show but they gave it some time and next thing you know, the show won many awards.  The fact that the show has been nominated for 22 awards in 2009 alone is a testament of how people respect the show's writing and its talent.  As mentioned earlier in my review, ""30 ROCK"" is one of those rare and unique shows on television and everything manages to work perfectly.I've watched Season 3 on television and I couldn't wait to watch the episodes again, that's how much I really enjoy this series.  It's witty, fun and comedy that is highly entertaining!  In fact, as for favorite episodes, there is just so many.  From finding out who Liz Lemon was talking to on the plane ride in the episode ""Believe in the Stars"", to see the reuniting of the ""Night Court"" characters and also see Jennifer Aniston's ""Claire"" getting into mischief in ""The One with the Cast of Night Court"", Kenneth going on a date with a blind staffer with Tracy's help in ""St. Valentine's Day"", Jack seeing a duplicate of himself on the Spanish soap opera in ""Generalissimo"" or Liz and Jack visiting Liz's high school reunion in the episode titled ""Reunion"".  There are just too many fantastic episodes from this third season, that I can't see any fan being disappointed.As for the DVD release of ""30 ROCK - Season 3', this DVD is literally a solid release.  Not only do you get all 22 episodes, 7 audio commentary (and the good news is that they give a variety of talent, even guest stars a chance to take part in the audio commentary) but you also get a good number of other special features that really round out this wonderful DVD release.  Overall, the show is wonderful and the only thing I can hope for is that Universal considers releasing ""30 Rock"" on Blu-ray via High Definition.But there is nothing negative I can say about this release.  It's a solid release and fans of the series will definitely get their money's worth!  ""30 ROCK - Season 3' is highly recommended."
I wish real - life work could be this silly and we could make fun of ourselves and also say wild things and have crazy flashbacks and laugh at work. the cast works well together as if they actually were these characters. fey is brilliant and I love her woman-whose-got -it -all but totally doesn't character. she's a mess on the inside.
"The first two seasons of 30 ROCK the series managed to accumulate every imaginable award, not merely Golden Globes and Emmys, but the highly prestigious Peabody.  TV Critics proclaimed it one of the greatest comedy series in TV history.  Despite all this, no one was watching the series.  NBC renewed it twice simply because it was far and away its most critically acclaimed show.  And as I said, it had a shelf full of awards to prove it.  In accepting the show's first Emmy show creator Tina Fey summed it up perfectly:  ""I'd like to thank our dozens and dozens of viewers.""Then came the 2008 election and John McCain chose as his running mate a photogenic but outrageously under qualified governor from Alaska.  She was a comically awful choice, but for a while not everyone realized that.  Then on Saturday Night Live Tina Fey returned to portray Sarah Palin.  Her impersonation devastated Palin's public perception and more or less destroyed her political career.  It helped that many of the most hilarious things that she said were incredibly close to what Palin actually said.  While her impersonation was not crucial to McCain's loss, it definitely played a role.  But in addition to the political effects, Tina Fey's Sarah Palin called attention to her and by extension 30 ROCK to a degree not previously possible.  In its third season, 30 ROCK's dozens of fans grew to millions.  NBC suddenly had a hit show.Before going on, we should pause and reflect on this.  Today the networks do not exhibit much patience with shows.  If they are not instant hits, they are canceled.  Even if they get considerable critical acclaim, like PUSHING DAISIES, they will still get canceled.  30 ROCK had survived only because it got such an extreme amount of critical acclaim.  Its critical success more or less tied NBC's hands.  But my point is that after two low rated seasons, the show was a sudden hit.  I wish the networks would keep in mind that great shows always have a chance to become hits.  In fact, they have greater chances than the vast majority of new shows.  Patience with good shows will usually pay off.And what a brilliant show it remained in Season Three.  No doubt their collection of awards will grown once again and it will deserve it.  30 ROCK isn't merely the best comedy show on TV right now, but one of the best ever, possibly the best ever after only ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.  Absolutely everything was perfect.  The writing was simply jaw dropping, with the jokes spilling out at a breathtaking pace.  Most comedy shows pad out the script, pacing the jokes because they don't know if they can keep coming up with the good ones, spacing the jokes with mildly humorous dialogue.  That isn't the way of Tina Fey and her team of writers.  They just assault the viewer with jokes, one right after another.  There are so many jokes that you simply can't keep up with them.  You just can't digest all of them.  What is more, sometimes the jokes are presented not one at a time, but in layers, two or three operating at the same time.  The jokes are verbal and they are also visual.  I still can't get the image of Liz Lemon showing her female friends her yoga pose out of my mind.This is as brilliant a set of characters as has been seen since the Bluth family made their premature exit from television.  Liz Lemon is an absolutely brilliant character, a lead character plagued by feet of clay.  Liz never really does the right thing for the right reason, but at most does the right thing for the wrong reasons.  She might not have an evil bone in her body, but neither does she have a good one.  Much the same is true of the magnificently self-absorbed Jack Donaghy.  Everything he does, no matter how bizarre, is done to further the interests of Jack Donaghy.  And Kevin the Page is one of the most unexpected hit characters on TV.  I'm sure when they started the series they knew he was going to be good, but who knew he would be as good as he ended up?  I'm sure they were confident that Tracy Jordan was going to be a great character, and they were right.  And Jenna Maroney might even surpass Liz and Jack in seeing the world as revolving around herself.  What makes this incredible group of characters even more incredible is that every actor portraying them is extraordinary.  Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin are simply the two best comic performers on TV and together they have created one of the great comic duos in TV history.There were some great comic arcs in Season Three.  Jack has a bizarre and out of character romance with his mother's nurse, played by Salma Hayek.  There is an unexpected glitch in it when her mother hates Jack because of his sharp resemblance to a villain in a Mexican soap (the villain is also portrayed by Alec Baldwin).  Liz persists in her efforts to adopt a child.  She also has a near romance with a very good looking neighbor, played to perfection by Jon Hamm, better known as Don Draper on MAD MEN.  Jenna wears herself out by simultaneously continuing to appear in THE GIRLIE SHOW while starring in an unauthorized biopic based on Janis Joplin (its being unauthorized meaning that in singing the Janis-like songs they can't use the real lyrics, something that leads to excellent results).  In short, hilarity results, again and again.The season ends on a highlight.  Jack learns the identity of his father, who just happens to need a kidney.  Much to his relief, Jack learns that he is not compatible, so they need to find a new donor.  So Jack twists the arms of Elvis Costello and other musicians to do a celebrity single.  The season ends with a group of musicians begging in a video for a kidney for Jack's dad.  Those performing on ""Kidney Now!"" include Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow, Clay Aiken, Mary J. Bilge, Steve Earle, two of the Beastie Boys, Adam Levine of Maroon 5, Norah Jones (who proudly sings that she is sober), Cyndi Lauper (who confesses that she is not), Sara Bareille, Michael Moby, Michael McDonald, rapper Talib Kweli, Wyclef Jean of the Fugees, Rhett Miller of the Old 97s, Robert Randolph, and Rachael Yamagata.  All in all, it is a pretty amazing assemblage of talent for a fake music video.So, once again 30 ROCK was a show that was hitting on all cylinders.  And now the ratings are strong enough that those of us who adore the show don't have to worry that the season that has just ended will be the last."
"I was very glad to see they made the second season and I most definitely hope for a third (same as with Shark series). Damien Lewis is so good that I started buying anything with him in it, just on the basis of the first Life season. Intelligent, funny and well plotted, far from sentimental with a hero who has more inner conflict than the current Batman but turns the opposing forces to his advantage - more of an Aikido disciple than Zen. Or both, probably.There are not that many really intelligent and funny series around (and especially surviving the ratings from your general public) so if you like your shows with lots of action but smart, with really twisted thinking and really good acting thrown in for a huge bonus, do not miss that one."
"We got to see the darkness that lurks in Charlie come very close to the surface in this season. When his friend asks him in the early part of the show, ""What do you want, Charlie?"" and says, just standing there with his arms at his sides, "" A peaceful soul."" I knew that this show would not disappoint me.I miss this show. I look at what is on these days and the best I can say, while pretty good (Burn Notice, Lie to Me, Doctor Who), they all lack the dark whimsy that was a vital part of Crewes' journey."
Damien Lewis and Sarah Shahi are two excellent actors and do a great job in a really written series.  Each episode has a self-contained story within a broader story arc over the full season.  My wife loved the series as well.
"I really wish there was another season to get started on now.  I don't know what I'll watch that I'll enjoy as much as I enjoyed life.  it had everything--suspense, drama, humor, intrigue, love.  I just stumbled upon it looking for anything different because I had started getting bored with the &#34;free&#34; stuff.  This was a really good pick."
"This was a quirky show, but it has Damian Lewis who went on to Homeland and Sara Shah who went on the Person of Interest and a cute shjow that I forgot the name of where she played a bubbly corporate negotiator--a real 180 from her acting in Life and Person of Interest.This show was cut short in its second season, but they did do a finale which was pretty good at tying up the loose ends.  I enjoyed the whole Zen thing and Lewis' unending pursuit of the people who framed him. The ending was maybe a little too happy an ending but overall I thought this was entertaining and I loved the actors."
"I really loved this show, NBC is totally bizarre in that they put really good shows on the air, and then pull them. I will never understand."
As I wrote in the review for season one.  This is a good show and the only thing I am unhappy about is that it is no longer being produced. Considering how many really bad shows are on the air I just don't understand why a good one like this fails.  Except the name and description don't sound interesting.  The show is though.
Great show. The second season was digging deeper into Charlie's enemies and it was just so compelling.  Side stories were getting good.  All the actors are top notch and on their game.  I wish NBC would have renewed it or another network would have picked it up.
IMO probably the best cop series I've ever seen. Very good writing and acting with a good cast. Damn shame it didn't run for a few more years.
"This class of writing is so rare.  The breadth of the story arc, the verisimilitude, the depth of character, and the humor make this an extraordinary series.  We're lucky it was made at all.  Don't regret that there are no more seasons.  It is absolutely perfect as it stands."
"At first I only watched oh, maybe 1/2 a show thinking hmmm I don't know..then I went back and did the whole show and reallygot into the main character mind you it's not the usual cop show which is a wonderful departure..the writing is inventive and quirky which makes it interesting. The stories are basically stories about cops and bad guys but the way they are treated keeps me coming back and I find that I will miss it as it only went 2 seasons. They can't seem to stand good shows in Hollywood. There aremany shades of grey in this series and if you are tired of the same ol same ol' give this a spin but it's the sticking with it that willreward you."
When this series first came on TV a friend of mine told me how good it was but I didn't have the opportunity to watch it.  I am so thrilled AMAZON had it and I watched every single one of them..It's a great show!!!!!
"There is and was NOTHING wrong with this show. It was crafty, unique and full of sharp wit program that was mishandled from the get-go by NBC. It also had the BEST CHARACTER in Charlie Crews (Damian Lewis) on television, as well as some of the best sub-characters like Dani Reese (Sarah Shahi) and her mysterious father Jack Reese (Victor Rivers). Not to mention Ted Early (Adam Arkin), who Crews met in prison, and he hired to handle his millions of dollars he received after being wrongly imprisoned.Yet, NBC moved it around the schedule, promoted it dismally, moved it to 9:00p and then eventually replaced it with the doomed Jay Leno show. Not sure what Jay Leno has on the executives at NBC, but whatever it is, could destroy NBC at its very core, cause it's causing them to make one terrible decision after the other.In its 2 short season, LIFE, proved to be a show that had more unique and creative storys to tell then any of the 3, or is it 4, CSI shows had. While CSI continued with its MURDER SHE WROTE for the 21st century, cookie-cutter story-lines, trying to come up with more and more ridiculous murders because they'd already done so many, LIFE grabbed you with its characters.While CSI Miami was heading into outer space, LIFE was cleaning out its lockers and tearing down its sets. I don't OWN a single episode of CSI on DVD. I own both seasons of LIFE on DVD. Cause the truth is, NBC probably just destroyed one of the best and most unique cop dramas/comedies to ever grace network television.All you got left are these 2 season DVDs and their well worth it. Now, we can only hope that some brilliant network, or cable network will pick it up and revive it. One thing to add though, the creators must have known it was coming because season 2 does resolve the mystery. It doesn't leave you hanging."
"i love the lead detectives personality. He is quirky and makes you think he is not really aware of what is going but in reality, he is on top of all of it. i enjoyed watching this limited series and look forward to more."
"To see a person that is always cool and collected in all situations is refreshing as no foul language is used but a strong action is performed is great. Highly interesting, beleivable characters in beleivable situations. Recommend it as high as posible."
It was a great a show on TV. Was nice to be able to see the episodes I missed. Should have kept this series going longer.
"I absolutely loved this show, still do.  Have watched both seasons several times over, I never get tired of it.  I think what really did it in at the time was the writers strike.  By the time it was all resolved, it was to late to save several shows, and Life was one of them."
Charlie is awesome! Loved this show - wish it would have continued! Thrilled to find it on Amazon Prime and watch every episode.
Life is the best cop series I have ever seen.  I wish it had had more than two seasons but think it would have ruined the whole concept of the show.  The characters and acting is superb.
I loved this show. I did a Life marathon and hated when it ended. I will probably watch it again.
"How often can you say that?  I'm usually happy with anything that's not Reality TV.  But this show leaves you craving more.  Even though the Second Season wraps up some of the answers of Charlie Crew's conspiracy theory, there are still a lot left.  I'm hoping NBC lets USA pick up a new person for their 'Characters Welcome' add.  I can't imagine not seeing this show for a few more seasons.  I would love to see Charlie and his first partner, Bobby, work together on some more cases.  And now that Shahi has had her baby, she can get back to work as Charlie's best partner, Dani.  Regardless, Season Two is great to watch over and over.  If you haven't got Season One yet, make it a dual purchase.  It's worth the money."
A quirky police mystery show with appealing characters. A wronged police officer returned to the force after 12 years in prison for a brutal crime he did not commit. Tempted to seek revenge but now with a new outlook on life--will he ever find out who set him up?They had to wrap up this series way too soon!
"Great show, good acting, realistic yet edgy, but the best part from my point of view was the plot twists and premise of the story.  Wish there were more."
"The quirky NBC crime drama ""Life"" gets a second season, featuring understated British actor Damian Lewis as LA detective Charlie Crews, who spent 12 years in prison for a mass murder he didn't commit before returning to duty anchored by the Zen Buddism he learned to survive his incarceration.  His partner is detective Dani Reese (Sara Shahi), recovering substance abuser and daughter of the policeman who may have helped frame Crews.  The pair are assisted by Bobby Stark (Brent Sexton), Crews' last buddy from his former days on the force.  Their new boss is Lieutenant Kevin Tidwell (Donal Logue), a transfer from New York who seems out of place in laid-back LA but who learns to appreciate Crews and Reese for very different reasons.  Adam Arkin returns as Ted Early, once Charlie's white collar criminal cellmate.The new season follows a familar formula: the detectives each week are handed a new case that proves far more complicated than first appearances.  Crews' Zen Buddist approach invariably provides unique, unexpected, and often humorous insights to cases involving, for example, a murder during a student prison experiment, the landing of a plane by a dead astronaut, and the suffocation of a rock star impersonator.The weekly cases also allow the viewer to watch the slow blossoming of the relationship between Crews and a once skeptical Reese.  Crews is by turns a quirky but kind searcher for truth and a shockingly tough cop, a combination Reese learns to value.  As Reese learns the truth about her father, she and Crews will discover they have more in common than just a badge.In a parallel story arc, Crews secretly unravels clues to the conspiracy responsible for his frameup.  That conspiracy has expanded to include a mysterious group of retired policemen, one or more rogue FBI agents, and a charming but ruthless Russian mob boss.  The conspiracy seems uncannily aware of Crews' every move, and acts ruthlessly to protect itself by attacking Crews, sending Ted Early unjustly back to prison, and endangering Dani Reese.  In the outstanding season finale, Crews will combine his Zen and his cop skills to ransom a kidnapped Dani and finally confront a ruthless killer.  Series fans will not be disappointed.""Life: Season Two"" on DVD is very highly recommended to fans of this unique police procedural.  This reviewer hopes against the ratings numbers that ""Life"" will get a third season."
I really enjoyed this show. I wish more detective shows were like this one. Too bad they had to put a sex scene in it. The show would have done better without that.
I think it was a remarkable show.  The mystery continued right up until the last episode of season 2.  Great acting.  I didn't get the ending about the choice between Charlie and the Russian.  Why was Nicklokov (err not sure about the spelling) jealous of Charlie?  I must have missed something.Too bad it went the way of too many other shows that were interesting.  Hunting for another Prime TV show to watch.
Damien Lewis is great in this role!  We really looked forward to watching each episode.  Would highly recommend this series.
I stumbled upon this series and am now a huge fan. The main character is an odd ball who has figured out how to survive the hand he was dealt. Each story has good plots. The characters are interesting and quirky. The main mystery continues from one episode to the next.I am now on series 2 and don't want this series to end!
Love this show......the characters- the depth and pealing back of each person involved....the fight between good and bad....the overwhelming feel of somehow things will come out ok by the end.....it's fascinating and the actors are superb ! Each episode is different and is compelling.
This was a great series & they did a good job of wrapping the story up by the end of season 2.  I still wish they had added a few more seasons.  All of the actors did a great job and the humor helped endear the characters to me.  You are never quite sure what Charlie is thinking or hiding under his ultra calm demeanor.  It is a fun watch to find out.
"I dont want to say anything but how we've enjoyed watching.&#34;Life&#34; is good, enough said.  Please, consider as much of this rating as needed."
"I loved watching Life on tv.  I am so disappointed that it was canceled.  I now own season one & two, purchased through Amazon, and enjoy watching them."
"Police work.without a lot of racing and chasing cars and gun fights. Although imprisoned several years spent the time delveloping himself until released because he did not commit the crime.  Good acting, well cast and plots that are not obvious."
"The only flaw I can find in the series is that it is much too short.  Even when the series finale must hit at the end of Season 2, the viewer still feels as though the writers care."
"Life is a brilliant series that lasted only 2 seasons for reasons unknown. It is very sad, very funny, and insightful."
"Seriously, I wish this series had continued past just two seasons, it is magnificent!  Please make more just like it!"
Cute procedural (uptight pretty girl detective and free spirit male detective) with above average writing. Magical performances by Damian Lewis make this more than watchable.
"My husband and I really enjoy this show.  We like the mystery they solve, the many twists and turns in the plot, even the humor.  The lead character is quirky and even believable considering he survived 12 years in prison as a convicted cop.  His search for the &#34;real&#34; killers of the crime he was convicted for is very convoluted and involves his partner's father.  The production quality is very good.  Even though it is a crime show  (murder) , we don't feel depressed after watching.  It doesn't dwell on the gory.  I recommend this show.  Wish there were more episodes.  (We have been out of the country since 2007 so missed show when originally ran.)"
"I am only through episode 11 of this season so far, but I absolutely love this show. I cannot for the life of me (pardon the pun) understand why NBC canceled this show. Damian Lewis is superb, he totally nails this part. But I guess if this show had not been canceled he would have been uable to accept the role of Brody in Homeland. So NBC's loss of this terrific show was Showtime's gain. This show is so worth watching!"
"Interesting first-rate actors, interesting plot twists.  There are always at least 2 subplots going on simultaneously.  One of them is recurring, so it makes you really want to see the next episode.  Also a touch of humor to go with the detective murder stuff.  I wish they had made more seasons of this show.  But the lead actor went on to even bigger and better things."
"Good actors, right mix of drama and comedy.  Would like to see the series continue some day but I see he was ressurected in 'Homeland'."
This was a great show that I was very disappointed to have seen go off the air. NBC makes blunders like all the rest of them and this was one of them by removing this show. At least they didn't leave you up in the air like FOX with the Terminator: The Sarah Conner Chronicles. The show is best watched in HD.
"I really like it! Appreciate not having so much vulgarity and profanity. This series was pretty good for that. It did not keep me on the edge of my seat like some of the others I've watched, but never theses it was a good series I could watch alone or on mixed company. If the language gets too bad, I simply turn it off and search for another movie or series!!"
"it had a different king of story line, i wish it would have gone more than 2 seasons long. that's it."
"Good acting, well-written, easy-to-follow and medium-paced.  It is a good change-up to film noir.  We look forward to another season."
I liked this show and the chemistry between Adam Arkin's character and Damien Lewis.  I would have liked to have seen Damien Lewis' partner throughout the season rather than a &#34;guest&#34; fill-in temp partner.  Like Damien and Sarah's chemistry on screen.
I received and email from Amazon on some recommendations and this was on that list.  We decided to check it out and glad we did but just sorry that it was only 2 seasons.  Never heard of this show before and it aired back in 08. We have one show left so I am curious on how it ended for this season. Maybe they could do what the Veronica Mars people did and bring it back for a movie to finish up any loose ends.
Very addictive and sometimes even very informative on different topics . writers have great sense of humor and getting very addictive
"The second season gets down and dirty. Yet the Zen flows. If you are a fan, you are a fan."
"Series storyline is a somewhat offbeat treatment of revenge and personal growth. Several characters that evolved during season one continue as Charlie Crews closes on his quest to fine the people who framed him so well he spent eleven years in prison. Charlie is a very good homicide detective who solves cases with his partner, Dani Reese, while pursuing his quest. Dani has hidden problems that in a strange way make her a good partner for Crews. Crews' Zen outlook and a few million from the wrongful imprisonment settlement with LAPD add a nice spice of fantastic cars and oriental philosophy. The supporting characters as well as the overall writing are strong and provide very enjoyable hour long episodes."
"this is a very refreshing series. its funny, entertaining and is good for kids too we need more shows like this"
"As usual with great shows, they retooled in the second season ruined it and it got canceled. Before that it was so well written, acted and presented that it was entertaining on every level."
"I do not watch many series over again after finishing them, but this one is one of the few that I find myself drawn to from time to time. I think the series itself is entertaining, but more importantly I enjoy the ending. I think the best stories end on an open-ended good note, because it seems like the characters could still be alive somewhere in your imagination. I think a lot of stories look too much at making an edgy or new ending and that in doing so, many fail to make a good story. I think this show is the perfect example of how a well-done story can enhance (and make exciting) a ""predictable"" good ending. This is one of my favorite series to watch, but it is my personal favorite as far as how they ended the series. The series has enjoyable characters, the main cast are all likable, and I find the Buddhist concepts to be an interesting step away from the norms in regard to the philosophies on life that the main character has. Some may not like it because he does not follow his own philosophy to the tee, but I think that makes the series better, because it shows that people are imperfect. The thing that makes the main character likable is that he knows he's imperfect, but obviously is trying to improve himself and his quality of well-being to the extent that anyone can.I would recommend the series, and I know I'll be watching it again."
I just discovered this program and I love it.  I just wish there were more to watch.  The characters were fun to watch.
I  loved this way back when it first showed on TV.  Why do they dump good shows and make these crappy ones today in year 2013'
Hope newer seasons appear.
THE STORY LINES ARE INTERESTING AND WELL DONE. THE ACTING IS BELEAVABLE.THE UNDERLINING STORY OF A COP IS VERY INTERESTING
Not just Damiano Lewis - the entire cast is superb. The writing is taut and directlng way above average. Don't know now I missed this series during it's original run but glad I stumbled across it! Given it an hour and you will be hooked!
"I am so sorry this did not continue. The show had intelligence, wit, great story line and writers plus the actors really seemed to enjoy their parts.  I wish I had known it when it was on so I  could have told the producers what a great show they had on their hands. Thank you."
"Some shows grab you from the first. This is one that was great. Don't know how I missed it when it was running. However, I really like watching in the series and not have to wait a week or more for the next story."
"I liked Damian Lewis, I thought he was very interesting to watch.  His facial expressionsetc. I was sorry for the show to be over."
"Was sorry to see this quirky, entertaining series come to an end. A great show that ended way too soon"
Each episode ends leaving you with the &#34;have to hurry and watch the next episode&#34;. Outstanding cast of actors. I recommend this tv series to all adults that enjoy mystery policemen shows.
"Again, this is my type of show.  I have only three shows to go and will miss my daily fix of &#34;Life&#34;.  I hope other viewers enjoy it as much as I have."
Usually a series will &#34;hit their stride&#34; by the 2nd or 3rd season.  Life had its &#34;stride&#34; from the very first episode and kept right on going to the very last episode of the second season.  Watch the first and second season as a &#34;miniseries&#34; because we'll not be seeing any more of this great series. Too bad.
This series is very entertaining and I like it very much.  I enjoy this type of series and am sad that they didn't make more seasons.
"My brother got me to watch this series recently and I thoroghly enjoyed it. I don't watch a lot of television, but am now sorry I missed it when it was on television. Unraveling the mystery of each show was fun to watch, but it was the chemistry between the characters that made this an awesome show. Really love the addition of the new captain. So sorry that they only made two seasons."
When the children who buy the programming cancel a series like this they should have their Pablum taken away. Simply one of the best.
This series only ran two years and the writers tied up the story line beautifully and it was very satisfying.  It got a bit complicated mid-season but it was well worth watching all the episodes.  The actors and the characters are great.
Excellent series and so neat to watch without advertising. Characters are strong and the plots exciting.  Watch it!  Better than national stations that haven't got a clue.
"There will always be great TV shows that get cancelled before their time. But the cancellation of Life was especially painful. The first season, like many other series, suffered from the writers strike, and only 11 of 22 episodes were made. This didn't stop the creators from producing a quality product, but the reduction in episodes made the tail end of that season feel rushed. The second season has 21 episodes, and they make the most of them.Life succeeds where many shows fail in that the show is able to focus on the main characters lives while still delivering interesting storylines that play off said characters quirks. Some shows feature characters with great chemistry, but the creators seem to think that chemistry is enough to hold a show together. Storylines will often take a back seat to the minutia of the lead characters, and hurt the show.In Life the characters personal problems are intergrated into the storyline making them feel organic, and much more enjoyable to watch. The cases they go on are never normal, but they never cross over into being wacky. The criminals are never your cookie cutter bad guys, but instead individuals with their own unique motivations that make them far more dangerous, and alot more fun to watch.Damian Lewis gives an incredible performance giving his character a wide array of emotions that never feel forced. Sarah Shahi is wonderfully grounded when standing next to Lewis and acts as a friend and not just the straight man that has become standard fare, though she does that very well. The new captain, played to great effect by Donal Logue,  complements the cast perfectly and never feels lile his character was forced on us. When Sarah was with child, Gabrielle Union stepped in and delivered a performance that did not try to copy Sarah's, but made the character her own.This is a phenomenal show that was cancelled long before it's time, and you will be doing yourself a disservice if you do not see it."
This is a great series. Of course you wouldn't normally have a detective who was once in prison but his wrong conviction and subsequent release makes this part of his character.
This was one of the shows that was cancelled that should have not been. Was a great show for action and drama. With a few laughs.
What a great show!BEST SEASON ENDING (of a crime TV show) OF THE DECADE!All the other writers for TV can learn here how it`s really done....
"I love this show. The balance of characters and great story writing make this one a winner. In my book, second only to Breaking Bad."
Love this show me and my husband watch this together. He is really picky when it comes to television. I &#60;3 Jax
"This was a surprise for me:  watched the pilot on a suggestion, and could not stop.  Somewhat violent for my taste, but, with that said, the performances are outstanding, all the way around.  I believe these characters.  Katy Segal is truly amazing as Gemma; and I like the soft side that they bring to Jax.  Looking forward to Season two."
"I did not think I would like this show, because not really into the whole biker thing, but after the first few episodes I was hooked, now I can't wait to watch.  I am on Season 2 and will continue to watch, it just keeps getting better."
"First, no television show could possibly recreate for viewers exactly how things are inside an OMC (outlaw motorcycle club). I think that SoA goes as far as it can in the re-creation but then, by necessity, stops. An example of that would be how the family atmosphere inside Samcro is overly sugar coated in some scenes. On the other hand, showing the sweeter side of the club members is essential to developing their characters. How well that is done may be reflected in the eventual success or failure of this show.Sons of Anarchy is good entertainment if you aren't too picky about occasional scenes that are just plain vulgar. You'll also have to be able to tolerate characters such as Tig, who is being revealed bit-by-bit as a more complicated character than many viewers would have suspected earlier in the season. I cannot forget or forgive that was Tig who said, ""No wonder I beat up hookers,"" when he was feeling exasperated by Gemma. But it seems the real threat from him isn't to hookers, it is the level of resistance he has against Jaz's attempts to legitimize the club. That may show an even darker side of Tig than we have already seen.I can't wait until next season!! By the way, in case you don't know, each episode of SoA is available for purchase for less than $2 here on amazon."
I loved this - I'm now hooked on the Son's of Anarchy&#34; and will watch the rest of the series!
"The cast is very believable; no forcing themselves to be something they aren't, which viewers could easily detect.  The plot twists and often has surprises most viewers could not predict.  Few flaws surface."
the show mixes action and story pretty well. it captures the outlaw biker (from what i've seen) very well. there is just one minor problem. people from the inland valley of california don't use such big callege words. this is obvously written by someone with an education and not an outlaw biker from the valley.i just found this show and friends of mine say the other seasons are better. i can hardly waitand Katie Segal is HOT in her tight jeans
"It is obvious that a lot of thought went into the script and casting of this show. Has the ability to appeal to a wide audience. Tragic love story, bad boy with a soft heart, fall from grace, any one of these descriptions could fit as well as many more. Great story line for the man and woman of the house."
"I was very annoyed with myself for missing this show during its initial run on FX.  However, I'm glad to catch up now.  I'm only about half way through the first season, but I'm totallly hooked.  The characters and story lines are very interesting and the violence (while graphic) is contextually appropriate.  With all grabage currently on TV, this show is a gem.  Also, gotta love the jacket!!!!"
"All the biker gangs featured show flawed people that live on the other side of the law and struggle with issues. This series draws in the viewer much more than is good and healthy, probably."
"""Sons of Anarchy"" comes from the mind of Kurt Sutter, a former writer and co-producer of FX's popular (and now recently concluded) series ""The Shield"".  Joining Sutter are fellow writers Dave Erickson (""Canterbury's Law"") and Jack LoGiudice (""Street Time"", ""Resurrection Blvd."" and ""7th Heaven""), composer Bob Theile Jr. (""The Office"") and cinematography by Paul Maibaum (""My Boys"", ""Samantha WHO?"" and ""Related"").The drama series revolves around a motorcycle club known as the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original (SAMCRO).  With SAMCRO chapters across the country, the original Sons of Anarchy motorcycle club was formed in an area called Charming.  Members consist of normal men who have their own responsibilities, life style and jobs but what they have in common is their allegiance towards the club.  And that allegiance includes being part of a life of danger.  For the Sons of Anarchy, the group makes a lot of money by dealing with importing illegal weapons which they sell to other gangs in the Bay Area (primarily the East Bay area), dealing with other organizations or mafia connections but taking a pride in their city and protecting local businesses and the people of the area.They are well-connected and also have ties to the inside of law enforcement and thus, are able to maintain their operations.  But of course, all is not safe as major gangs are there to cause the club some havoc.  There are those who try to mess with them or steal SAMCRO's shipments such as the white supremacist group known as the ""Nords"", their Latino rivals from Oakland known as the ""Mayans"" and possibly other dangers including the authorities.The first season of ""Sons of Anarchy"" focuses on member Jax (Charlie Hunman, ""Undeclared"", ""Hooligans""), a member who tends to takes care of operations for the club and is quite respectful of his allegiance to the club that his father John had started and ran until his death many years ago.SAMCRO is now run by Clarence ""Clay"" Morrow (Ron Perlman, ""Hellboy"" films and ""Beauty and the Beast"") who married Jax's mother Gemma (Katey Sagal, ""Married with Children"", ""Futurama"", ""8 Simple Rules...For Dating My Teenage Daughter"") and have lived a life of making money but now are starting to feel the financial constraints.Both have made the Sons of Anarchy to a club that is profitable (due to the club's illegal dealings) but things start to change when Jax discovers his father's belongings especially with the discovery of his dead father's unpublished manuscript.  It appears that his father has envisioned change for the Sons of Anarchy and because of this, Jax notices that with all the trouble and danger the club faces now, perhaps its time to change things for the positive for the club.Jax eventually starts to show doubts towards the club's activities and starts to become more compassionate to the personal lives of some of the members and thus puts himself into a position that can lead to conflict with the his step-father/leader of the Sons of Anarchy.  Of course, this change of thought starts to rub certain members the wrong way, some who question Jax's ability to lead in the future.Needless to say, Jax's mother, Gemma starts to be concerned of her son's interest in her dead husband's belongings and looks at things as if her deceased husband is trying to talk to her son from the grave.  Thus, she wants her husband Clay to make sure that Jax doesn't hurt the operations of the Sons of Anarchy and make sure he doesn't stray.Throughout the series, we get to see how the club operates but most of all how tight or how troubled the internal brotherhood is between the members of the motorcycle club and the dangers they face.Members of the Son of Anarchy also include:* Bobby ""Elvis"" Munson (Mark Boone Junior) - The treasurer of the club and an Elvis impersonator* Tig Trager (Kim Coates) - The sergeant-at-arms.  Clay's right hand man and incredibly violent.  Doesn't believe in Jax as the successor to the club.* Filip ""Chibs"" Telford (Tommy Flanagan) - The medic of the club that served for the British Army.* Piermont ""Piney"" Winston (William Lucking) - Opie's father and co-founder of SAMCRO.* Harry ""Opie"" Winston (Ryan Hurst) - A member of SAMCRO who has been off-an-on with the group because of his obligations to his wife and kids.  Thus he stays away from their illegal activities.* Juan Carlos ""Juice"" Ortiz (Theo Rossi) - The club's intelligence officer, ahe hacker and the guy with the inside connections.* Kip ""Half-Sack"" Epps (Johnny Lewis) -  A member of the club and former Iraq vet.""Sons of Anarchy - Season One"" is featured on three Blu-ray discs.

The series is a series that has a large number of scenes shot outdoors and for the most part, the picture quality features excellent detail.From the scenery of the mountains, the motorcycles, the weapons, the explosions,  the violent maiming of gangsters and the blood, burnt flesh and details of the wounds are quite clear and detailed on this Blu-ray release.Also, during the darker scenes, I didn't catch any major high compression or high noise during those low-light situations.  Skin tones are natural and you can catch some scenes with the skin pores and for the most part, the picture quality is brilliant although you do see occasional grain but definitely not distracting.Audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (Spanish in Dolby Digital).

From the revving of the engines of the Harley-Davidson motorcycles to the booms of explosions and the gunshots, the series definitely utilizes the surrounds during those action-scenes.For the most part, the explosions and weapons are minimal and most of the audio is dialogue-driven and is primarily front and center channel driven.  As with the rock music that plays throughout the series.  But for the most part, fans of the series will enjoy the lossless track and its use of the various channels throughout the series.Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Sons of Anarchy - Season One"" comes with the following special features:DISC 1:On disc 1, select audio and you will be able to find the following audio commentary:* Commentary for Pilot - Featuring audio commentary with Kurt Sutter, Guy Feeland, Charlie Hunnam, Ron Perlman and Katey Sagal.DISC 2:On disc 2, select audio and you will be able to find the following audio commentary:* Commentary for the Pull - Featuring audio commentary with Kurt Sutter, Guy Feeland, Maggie Siff and Charlie Hunnam.DISC 3:* Commentary for the Revelator- Featuring audio commentary with Kurt Sutter, Charlie Hunnam, Ron Perlman, Kim Coates, Mark Boone Junior, Theo Rossi, Ryan Hurst, William Lucking, Johnny Lewis and Tommy Flanagan.* The Making of Sons of Anarchy, Season 1 - (8:59) Interviews with the producers, creator and cast about the series.

The interesting thing is that back in the late 1970's, the outlaw life was typically portrayed on television as this hell-bent biker gang but films really never fully explored it well, actually, if anything, they were just used as an episode of ""C.H.I.P.S"" and were people wreaking havoc on innocents.There is a culture among the biker clubs and it was great to see a series that featured characters in a variety of depth and it is quite evident that creator/writer Kurt Sutter did his research well in capturing that culture, the look and feel of the individuals (and of course, great casting) but bringing together this gritty storyline of opposing gangs and rival biker clubs and creating this world where life is not always peaceful and allegiance for the club, you need to sacrifice for the club.  Personally, I was captivated by the storytelling and from beginning to end, realize that hell is going to break loose in Season 2.  Granted, I say this not knowing anything about motorcycle gangs up-close and personal but I would assume with all the time that Sutter spent with the various motorcycle clubs, there are some aspects of that culture that he brought into this fictional drama series.  And of course, that correlation to Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" makes the series quite intriguing.I have to admit that before watching the series, I wasn't sure how Charlie Hunnam (who typically plays popular guy that the girls dig type of roles), Katey Sagal who has been in more sitcom-based shows and more dramatic series and of course, Ron Perlman, an actor that viewers are used to seeing him in ""Hellboy"" or the old classic ""Beauty and the Beast"" series.  But for the most part, each of the talent did wonderful job and the series is literally well-cast.  Hunnam as Jax sans the English accent almost has this Heath Ledger type of feel to his character that works.  Katey Sagal does an excellent job playing a mother, but a mother who has the potential of going bad.  And of course, Ron Perlman definitely has that look of a person you don't want to cross.  Add in the other talent and  overall, the way they play their characters are is convincing.  Again, the talent are definitely well-cast!The Blu-ray further enhances the enjoyment of the series with picture quality really capturing the violence and grittiness of the series.  In the first episode, the first time you lay your eyes on the charred remains of two people, you know that this series is not going to be ""pedestrian"" and by the end of the first episode, you realize that the series is quite violent but fits the situation quite well.  As mentioned before, the lossless audio track definitely compliments the series, especially for those who can't get enough of that engine revving of the Harley's in high definition.  Also, picture quality is well-done and again, as beautiful as the scenery is of the mountain regions and the camera panning through the various Harley's, the picture quality also captures the detail of the violence of the series.""Sons of Anarchy - Season One"" was definitely a big surprise for me and it's good to know that FX has continued the trend of having well-written, well-cast and overall, another riveting drama series.  Overall, this series is highly recommended!"
It was recommended to me by a friend and I found it to be well written with great actors.  It is the type of show that you start watching 1 episode and end up watching 3 or 4
How can you not be addicted to this show? So many people are hooked on it!  Glad to own it.
I find this series unique as it draws both pathos and anger in equal measure.  Always a surprise!  See it!
I love this DVD set.  I received this set before date promised.  I now have the entire collection.  I love this series.
"If you haven't seen this show, see it.  If you like vegan, metrosexual life type shows, go watch ""Friends"" and eat a tofu burger.  If you are a man or woman who likes drama and entertainment without the neurotic crap, this is a show."
"This is with out a doubt the best show on tv. A cross between the Shield and the Soprano's! It has action,drama,comedy,and a great story line.(no, Im not a biker)I stayed up all night and finished the first season.If the second season is as good I will stay up all night and watch it!"
I put off watching this show even though my kid told me it was addictive....this show had me hooked from the beginning
Great show. Excellent series...Must Watch. Amazon Prime Video Service is the best..Quality is excellent. 5 Stars. Best motorcycle Gang show ever made.
This show is amazing. I can not wait for the next season to start. Hot guys and hot exciting action.
We bought this copy of SOA as a gift for someone. We are totally hooked on this show and can't wait for the next season to come out!
"I've been watching for the last few seasons, but realized I had never watched the first season so I gave it a watch."
my wife and i love the show.  can't wait to watch the other seasons which are also on amazon prime.
"I have never really seen many of these episodes but have heard they were really good, and since prime offered I decided what the heck lets see what the fuss is all about. Well I am now on Season 2 and I absolutely love watching it. Jax is a hottie and can make you drool, for sure. LOL I grew up with my step father in a similar atmosphere so watching these brought many memories from my childhood back, both good and bad. Just make sure you don't let the little people watch this, it can be a bit harsh."
"Gritty and interesting show has a great bunch of actors involved. The story twists and turns remind me of 24 hours, which also kept my interest of the run of that series."
"Great show something different on tv a biker gang sometimes bad sometimes good, who looks out for each other even their women have attitudes and are bad chicks . I love FX pick of tv shows and they keep bringing something different."
"It initially was difficult to like the characters in the first season of ""Sons of Anarchy"". The criminals were violent with little about them to like. The surrounding characters seemed to have been drawn into their bad situations at their own choosing. Even the ""good guy"" law enforcement personnel were deeply flawed and generally despicable. As the season progresses, the story lines and conflicts became more intriguing. The season ends well with one wanting to find out what the future holds.There are some general plot lines of ""Sons of Anarchy"" that are reminiscent of ""The Sopranos"". Both series had mother figures with a strong presence where one realizes that, in a family feud, the mother has deliberately and potentially let her son be placed at risk. That is some wake up call for the main character. In both series, the main characters need to consider how to handle ""a rat"", yet to give ""Sons of Anarchy"" great credit, their story line on this is gripping. This is a series that slowly grabs the viewer and pulls the viewer in."
"interesting story, compelling actors and great dialogue. most shows never get as good as this one is right out of the gate. the PILOT was awesome. cannot wait to see the rest.has the feel of a movie instead of tv. katie segal ROCKS."
"This show is all you would  want in a television show to be! It has a plot, it is entertaining, sex, exciting from begining to end. I wold recommend this show to all who want an adventure right in your living room. You have to get this one in your collection!"
"Not used to something this violent but I have to say that I have enjoyed the show.  It is sexy, well written and I am counting down the days until Season two is delivered.  So if you are unsure about this programme then take a chance on it because it is filled with interesting characters.  Do Yourself a favour and given this one a go."
I fell in love the minute I seen Peg Bundy on the screen as a bad girl. Love it and Jax is goregous.
"I love this show! I love the cast and enjoy how they interact and play off each other. The storyline is so-so and sometimes not believable, but it's the group of actors that I like."
"This is a very good television show, it has good acting, writing, and guest stars.  I watch this on FX and am hoping to buy Season 2 as soon as the price drops on it. There really isn't much more I can add to the review."
"A great start to a great series. The characters are complex and flawed, which lends an air of reality to the episodes. Nothing is ever black or white, but a leathery shade of gray. A great story, carried by a great story teller and a great cast."
"If you can take the gritty in your face drama dealing with guns, drugs, gangs, their dealing with law enforcement.  This show has everything, mc chases/action for the guys, drama for the women.  Character depth and depiction in this show are spot on amazing for law enforcement and the the mc clubs/criminal elements of show.  The actors really pull in the muscle and deliver their characters authentically.  The way the mc club deals with other gangs, similar to politics.  Setting is also realistic depicting the urban decay of our Nor-Cal roadways, and urban buildings.  I just wanna know where all the award nominations are for this show.  Motorcycle Clubs are about the men, but the women in this show really pull their weight, especially Katey Sagal.  I am not into bikes other than the creativity that goes into the custom bikes,  and never thought I would be interested in this show, but it is truly awesome for a TV show."
"This is a wild ride, on the one hand we've got this incredibly hyper violent bike gang made up of some really good guys. Seriously who would NOT want to go out for a beer with jackson, Opie, Chips, Scotty, Juice or Bobby Elvis?? Clay is another matter. Then there is the comparative morality of corrupt politicians, cynical, venal government agencies and morally compromised businessmen. So they get into all of these wild escapades, nothing is ever what it seems and the SOA is always about 15 minutes from death, destruction and prison as one scheme after another backfires. Someone should make a reel of the many ""oh s***"" moments in the series, whenever someone says it, it has already hit the fan. But it is never boring. I guarantee that if you buy the series you will be up all night watching it, simply to see what happens next. Highest possible rating."
This is a totally addictive show.  One of the few I've watched all seasons of.  Great writing and acting - wish it would never end.
I am glued to this exciting season 1.  Getting to know the character's and loving them. SAMCRO - SON'S OF ANARCHY - S.O.N'S are a Northern Calif bad boy bike club living and doing legal and illegal business in the town of &#34;Charming&#34;.  The illegal part of their business is what fans the heat and creates hovac for the boy's.  Adult show. Can't wait for season 2.
I rated this 5 starts because I enjoy the show -- it is tantalizing - and I cannot put it down.The only negative parts that I would change are some of the words/language used which is very stout  - and some of the scenes which are a little too sexual graphic .. but the show overall is a good one.
"The characters are well cast and believable. The storyline keeps you interested and coming back for more. There is violence but at this point it is not excessive but as the series continues the violence escalates. The show gets five stars and one of the primary reasons I gave it five is the noticeable lack of profanity in the script. There is a tendency to use four letter words to keep viewers from noticing that the writers have no better way to hold your interest, like an intelligent dialog between characters."
"I can't recommend this series enough. Excellent writing, excellent acting. As for so mant great series, they end way too soon. Highly recommend this series to all."
"Well, it's great fun if you like extreme violence and soap opera. Normally neither one of those by itself can get me excited, let alone combined. In this case Kurt Sutter and crew have pulled off a masterpiece. It takes great writing, great producing, great directing and great acting to get me interested in the lives of people I wouldn't want to know, let alone be, and that's exactly what 'Sons of Anarchy' has. Sutter manages to borrow just the right amount of Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' and 'The Godfather' to make a show similar to 'The Sopranos' but from the bottom of the criminal barrel rather than the top. I had never heard of Charlie Hunnam, but this British-born actor is perfect as Jax Teller. Katie Sagal takes a dark turn from her usual comedy as the biker bitch queen who will do just about anything to protect her family, even when it's from people whose only crime is to not fit her twisted idea of perfection. She walks a fine line between &#34;saving&#34; her son and driving him away. Ron Perlman is also terrific as the king of the Sons, who not only has to keep his stepson in line but also keep him from finding out about his own darker deeds.The rest of the cast are also perfect for the roles they play, and manage to make a group of not-very-nice characters into someone we can consistently relate to, if not exactly like."
"Had not watched this show during the first season run, but I had customers asking about it for months now, so in seeing the Blu option I took a chance. The demand has been huge and the feedback has been excellent. A well produced show, a great cast, a gritty yet flowing soundtrack (Primal Scream, Lions, Bob Thiele, Curtis Stigers) all put together onto a solid Blu package.The picture quality through all 13 episodes maintained decently, with only a few failures here and there depending on the night footage. The DTS is mixed just well enough to hear such gems as a cigarette burning while the Harley floods the outer channels, or a dog barking out a rear channel that makes you jump, or one of the few bass scenes (thumping music) when they enter the Niners Club in Oakland. The music was actually done just right in each episode as to not drown out any peripheral chatter or relevant goings-on. The supplements are placed entirely on disc 3 and include:* Making of - 9 minutes which initially I thought was way too short but it gets made up for with everything else.* Ink - 4:45 clip on everything tatoo. Unfortunately none of them were real.* Bikes - 7 minute blurb on everything one needs to know about each character's mc. Caters to the enthusiasts wondering about the specs.* Casting - 15 minutes of audition tapes mixed in with interviews for each primary and secondary character. I liked Pileggi's take on showing people he can be bad (""not Skinner"").* Deleted scenes - 35 minutes, half of which should have been left in, especially with such gems (plot holes) as how those panties kept getting flushed, Segal's chest scar, the clothing optional bathroom scene, Prospect feeling the wrath for beating Elvis, Pine being more aware of Clay's feel on his kid, and more.* Gag reel - 7 minutes that actually contained more highlights than gags, including every single kill of the season crammed into one minute, every single breast, butt and kiss shot montaged together, and the answer to that nagging question of what Tig really did in the morgue (he is just not right at all).* Commentary on the last episode by a ton of cast and crew.The 3 disc set is a worthwhile owner for any fan of the series, and even though there are plenty of clarity fades and intermittent grain, the Blu package filled out nicely. Plenty of heated debates out there about the authenticity of the show, but Kurt Sutter was very honest about the research and stated no one would give him a single iota of material - he had to imagine all of this up. Congrats on making a competent brotherhood motorcycle club family drama."
This was a wonderful surprise. I hadn't expected such a thrilling storyline.I do not miss an episode now.  You'll love it too.
"Excellent show, with raw action. I honestly could not stop watching until I had finished the whole Season. Starting on Season 4 today!"
Excellent series!  All of the actors are fantastic.  This show is very addictive and keeps you glued to you seat the whole time.
This show was not what I expected at all. I really thought it was about old white men riding bikes living away from society trying to preserve their golden years. Boy was I wrong. This show is like new jack city meets scarface meets the god father who then meets training day. Lol. I watched all 5 seasons in one week!!! I was totally hooked.  You actually see each character develop and you can actually relate to their plight in some strange way. You kind of start rooting for the characters although socially and morally there actions need to be condemned. Definitely more graphic and explicit than any show I have ever scene. At one point I thought this must be the unedited version.  But nope  FX is the new HBO for cable. Lol. Just started watching the new season 6 and it is very graphic as well.
"Great show, always keeps you on your toes. Makes you want to like the bad boys even though you know you shouldn't"
"I wasn't going to watch this series, I waited until season 4(?) to start watching. Thankfully with amazon instant video I didn't have to wait for weekly installments-the suspense probably would have felt like it was killing me. I didn't think a biker show would &#34;do it for me&#34;, I was wrong! This is so much more than &#34;some biker show&#34; intense drama, well thought out psychology and human motivations/emotions, I was totally hooked on this show. One of the characters says about JAX &#34;you have that young Brad Pitt thing going on&#34; it so true, he's beautiful and intense. Katie Segal is awesome as the badass biker mama of the show, the queen bee-I can't believe it's &#34;Peg Bundy&#34; wow! Absolutely love Jimmy Smidts(the suave pimp lol) in the later seasons. Kurt Sutter, the writer and creator of the series is a diabolical genius-I don't say this lightly-he puts a lot into making this a high quality series from story, cinematography, actors to the perfect music. This show has it all I'm so glad I gave it a chance now I'm truly addicted. (The show Vikings reminds me of these guys but medieval and on boats instead of bikes FYI) I hope you also give Sons of Anarchy a chance if you had any reservations, set them aside(it also reminds me of Sopranos, it filled that TV void for me anyway.)"
"No one would have thought that when JAG introduced a new team of naval criminal investigators that it would spawn a new television phenomenon. When NCIS spun off from JAG in 2003, it was billed as a more modern, more action-packed version of the legal military drama. While NCIS started out fairly modestly in the ratings, it became one of the few shows out there to increase ratings every season until it became one of the most-watched shows on television. NCIS became so popular, in fact, that it's spawning a spin-off of its own, NCIS: Los Angeles, set to air this fall on CBS.NCIS follows the lives and adventures of a group of Naval Crime Investigative Service agents who conduct criminal investigations for the US Navy and Marine Corps.What makes NCIS one of the best crime dramas on television are its amazing characters and cast. Every member of the NCIS team has a unique personality that adds humor, spunk, fun, and a degree of unpredictability. From the perverted, boyish -- and, might I add, die-hard Ohio State Buckeyes fan -- Anthony ""Tony"" DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly) to the perky, tattoo-covered, caffeine-addicted goth Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette) to the gut-instinct, dashing Leroy Gibbs (Mark Harmon) and others, NCIS is the perfect mix of fast-paced crime drama and spot-on character chemistry.Even if you aren't a big fan of crime dramas, are turned off by the blood and dead bodies, or just want to stay away from military-related shows, NCIS still has something to offer. The interplay between the characters is hilarious, fun, and just downright enjoyable. The cast really works together to make the show shine -- really, most television casts don't even come close to the character chemistry in NCIS.Season six is another triumph for the series, continuing the show's trademark creative, character-driven dialog. The cases are just as fact-paced, fascinating, and unpredictable as ever. Even more than previous seasons, though, season six plays on emotional cases and unexpected occurrences that take the characters to the edge. Each episode is packed with plenty of amazing twists and turns and leads to an unforgettable cliff-hanger.One of the (very) few downfalls of this season is the pair of ""Legends"" episodes that take Gibbs and Agent Tim McGee (Sean Murray) to Los Angeles. The purpose of these episodes is to introduce the cast and concept of NCIS's spin-off show, NCIS: Los Angeles, much like when NCIS spun off from JAG. While I understand the reason for these episodes, and appreciate that they are still interesting and well-paced, I found that I missed the NCIS characters that I have come to love. There just wasn't enough of Ziva, Abby or Tony in these episodes.The bonus features for season six are great. They include cast and crew commentary on a handful of episodes, an acoustic version of Pauley Perrette's ""Fear"" from the NCIS soundtrack, a great collection of cast discussions about the events of season six, an enlightening feature on the company that creates the artificial bodies used on the show, an in-depth look at the first story arc of the season, and a feature on the unforgettable episode ""South by Southwest.""This season continues the legacy of NCIS and proves once again why it's one of the best crime dramas and highest-rated shows on television. Be careful when you buy this one, because you'll want to sit back and watch every episode back-to-back before starting over again. If this is your first introduction to NCIS, you'll want to rush out and get the other seasons.Turst me -- once you try out NCIS, you'll be hooked until the end."
"We love NCIS and for some reason, we did not watch it when it started on TV.  Later when we discovered it we wanted to start watching it from the beginning."
Just started Season 6 - I enjoyed the first 4 episodes...I have lots of catching up to do and am glad Amazon provided the DVDs at such a great price.  NCIS fan.
There are many reasons that this is a very popular TV series.  The characters are likeable and excellently acted.  The stories are interesting well written.  The whole effort is a masterly mix that makes an excellent show.
"This season introduces one of the best characters NCIS Director Vance.The director is now a political operative with real field experience attuned to the realities of Washington.Gibbs begins the season with a new team.  Vance disbanded the team we know and love as punishment for Jenny Shepard's death.Pulling the old team back together and the real reason they were disbanded is the crux of the first few episodes.An on-going storyline is the conflict between Gibbs and Vance as they learn to live and work together.Many of the stories are intensely personal.We meet Gibb's father, Ziva's lover and see McGee work under extreme pressure in a woman's prison.We are back to 24 episodes in one of the best seasons of a top-notch show."
The story lines have progressed beyond the death of the week and we see a lot of character expansion in this year.  Production values are still good.
I ordered all seasons and have had no problems with any of them. If you like the show then order them. Came fast and no problems with the DVDs.
I grew up in a military family and i love this show!! It definitly the only crime show i watch on TV!
"This is a great series about the NAVY  and you get more background on the characters, like you do in  the other seasons. You should get each season to keep up with the  it better."
"Some shows, by the time they get to their third or fourth season, are getting tired and less fun and enjoyable. Not this one. JAG was the same way, good all the way to the end. The sixth season of NCIS still has fun and interesting stories, the actors are on spot and the chemistry between them is still great."
I love this series and the storylines i would recommend it to anyone over the age of 18 years for sure
"I love every season on NCIS I am such a fan I own every season that is out there to have, the show is great the cast is great it is an awesome show !!!"
This is by far the best show ever made. I own them all and will continue to buy each new season. The cast is perfect and the writer writes very interesting and fun shows. I love NCIS in every way!
"At the end of Season 5, in the aftermath of Jenny Sheppard's murder, Rocky Carroll's Leon Vance--with Carroll drawing liberally from Daniel Benzali's Robert Quinn on ""The Agency"" (Remember, Carroll was part of the ensemble of that series in the early part of this decade) had reassigned Jethro Gibbs' three field agents--sending Tony DiNozzo to be an agent afloat, Tim McGee to the Cybercrimes Unit, and Ziva David back to Mossad--and had given Gibbs a new team.Well...PSYCHE.The main theme of this season--which famously kicks off with Ziva, in that killer blue backless dress, singing ""Temptation"" in a speakeasy just before a bomb goes off--is a theme of trust; with the inital eight episodes being woven around the investigation of a mole within the MTAC, and leading into the deeper storyline of David's allegiances being questioned...as well as her relationship with a male Mossad agent.  I'm sorry, that's what piques Tony's interest...The actors at this point are wearing their characters as they would a good, comfortable pair of shoes.  Mark Harmon's Gibbs is in a relationship more adversarial with Vance than he was with Sheppard (Not really a surprise, given Jethro's history with Sheppard), but is still the driving force of the team.  Michael Weatherly is still having fun with the intrusive, horny DiNozzo; but it is also at the point that Tony is REALLY beginning to have Ziva issues.  I've often talked about the dynamic between Weatherly and Cote De Pablo as being reminiscent of David Addison and Maddie Hayes from ""Moonlighting"", but this relationship also is vaguely reminiscent of the Harmon Rabb/Sarah MacKenzie relationship from NCIS's father series, JAG.  Sean Murray's Tim McGee has grown by leaps and bounds in terms of confidence--especially when dealing with DiNozzo, though he still has a healthy fear of Ziva (Especially when Z finds that McGee still has a picture of her in the bikini from Sheppard's ill-fated California trip).  We have to concede that NO ONE ELSE could have given Abby Sciutto the life and energy that Pauley Perrette has, just as no one else other than David McCallum could have given life to Donald Mallard.  It's good that Brian Dietzen has finally been given ""Also Starring"" status in the opening-block credits.I've tried to make the point that Rocky Carroll's Leon Vance has changed the dynamic of the office.  In many ways, Jethro could always find some way to push the previous director's buttons--and wouldn't hesitate to do as much...but Vance seems much more of a mystery to Gibbs; and keeps his cards to his chest about situations.One of the highlights of the first eight episodes--""The Traitor in The MTAC"" storyline--is ""Heartland"", another one of the ""Who Is Jethro Gibbs?"" stories that we get once or twice a season now.  This episode is an investigation of the beating of a Marine from Gibbs' hometown, taking Jethro home and introducing the viewers to his pleasant and charming father, Jackson, and has the father and son resolving some long-held differences.  That Papa John Walton himself--Ralph Waite--gave a gusto to the elder Gibbs the viewers took to, it will be nice to see Jack return every so often.I've said many times about this series that it's the recurring characters around Gibbs and the team that make the series go, and this season is no exception.  We start with Liza Lapira and Jonathan LaPaglia in the ""Traitor"" arc; Lapira's tragic turn (And the look between Michelle Lee and Jimmy Palmer in the opener...), the introduction of Mark Harmon's son Sean playing Jethro in flashbacks--especially ""Heartland"" where Jethro learns about ""the rules"" and the surprise of who teaches him about them...Jude Ciccolella turns as Secretary of The Navy...Joe Spano's annual visits as Gibbs' rival/friend Tobias Fornell...the always entertaining Muse Watson as Gibbs' bend-the-rules mentor from when Jethro was a ""probie"", Mike Franks...and David Dayan Fisher's Trent Kort, who still seems to operate on agenda...and not necessarily the Company's agenda.The second storyline--whether Mossad has compromised Ziva, and her connection to the agent/assasin Michael Rivkin (Merik Tadros, who brings some echoes of Rudolf Martin's Ari Haswari from the first two seasons)is the more dominant story of the season, and does more to shake the team to the point that Ziva chooses to stay in Israel at the end of the season.This plays as a season of growth--the relationship/entity the fan base now calls ""Tiva"", Gibbs showing more of his history/character, Ziva showing that she CAN be shaken...the relationship between Vance and Gibbs and the surprises that Gibbs DIDN'T know...Absolutely recommended."
"IIt's a good season though I enjoyed 4 and 5 more so probably because of the former Director I thought she was great. And as some had hoped I'm sure for those whom are dedicated fans, probably felt that Gibbs and Shepard would eventually gotten together had she continued in the show. Not sure why they had to kill her off the show. But when season 6 got going with the new Director didn't like him at first. But as each season went on began to like him better. Now that they are doing season 10 and hopefully 11 next fall. All the cast fit well together it seems. Though have heard rumors that someone is leaving the show. I don't know for sure who yet. But if you look at reality of the show. Gibbs and Ducky would be approaching retirement age in the real life if they keep it that way. Unless Gibbs were to get promoted to Director or Assistant Director. Ducky even though I really like the guy with all the talk he does speaking of historical things as he works. I just hope if they do retire Gibbs or promote him Tony would be next in line to run the team. Then at that point Hopefully the rest of the team stays together they work so well together it's like everything clicks into place. The way they are. I guess I'll find out later when Fall season starts what happens next."
I love Survivor Gabon a lot it was really fun that the Fang and Kota are the Gabon Tribes nice
"Great season, lots of drama. It is some good reality TV. If you are a Survivor fan, watch it. I bought it."
No spoilers.I enjoyed this season very much. I found it entertaining throughout the entire thing and there were some standout characters that I'll remember for quite some time.
"I've become obsessed with watching this show.  Thanks to Amazon Prime Instant Stream and Hulu..  I can actually go back and watch them all.  This season is slow starting, but ends with a bang in my opinion.  Definitely recommend if you like to see the underdog prevail."
"Great season, very entertaining and well worth 10 bucks! I can't wait to get more of the past seasons I missed!"
"Finally, the survivors are thrown into a world that doesn't include a beach.  There are also many more interesting animals for the cameras to capture, which was a nice change from the usual snakes and fish of all the island survivors.  Now all we need are some more extreme environments for future seasons to really make it a challenge."
I could watch Survivor every day and not get tired of it.  It is better than watching hourly drama's that you already know the ending to.
Survivor. Jeff Probst is the best. Gabon was very good. Surprise winner. You'll love it. Africa at its best. Buy this.
"As with all the previous years, this is a great series. The show has not lost its appeal and the acting is still above par."
This is a great show with alot of entertainment and drama.  I have all the seasons. It is fun to watch from start to finish.
"Loved this show.  Many laughs came from watching this show, so sad when it ended, love William Shatner and the rest of the cast"
"This is the premature end of a really great series. It was probably the best on TV since The West Wing. Like the WW it had a great cast, strong writers and great directing. The only real problem with Boston Legal globally was besides the 3 main characters, the continuous change in the secondary characters between all seasons. This led to the loss of mainly some great female characters that were indispensable. This was in line with Ally McBeal where characters disappeared between seasons without much explanation. This has been the main problem with the series since it has not permitted continuity. Otherwise the series has been perfect. The acting from Shatner, spade and Bergen is simply wonderful. The series does end in a slightly weird manner but weird episodes was a recurrent phenomenon in thie series as well as in Ally McBeal. All I can say is may they all live happey together but we will miss them."
"For five years viewers of television have had the opportunity to watch a show that was interesting, intelligent, motivated at times by the cause of the week and definitely funny as hell. It's too bad that these sorts of shows never seem to catch on with the viewing public. Then again, given network televisions desire for an immediate hit and ridiculous choices to alter their schedules on a whim, it's easy to see why a deserving show might slip through the cracks or be lost amid the weekly shuffle. Such is the case with BOSTON LEGAL.After five seasons on the air, BOSTON LEGAL has closed the doors to the offices of Crane, Poole and Schmidt. Which is too bad for television audiences since another great series bites the dust to only be replaced with the cost effective reality show of the week or perhaps a star vehicle for the pet of some producer. Then again it makes for great news for DVD fans because as well as the show did, it was given the chance to be released on DVD. And this last season just released gives us the chance to savor the episodes from season five like fine wine.For those who have never seen the show, start with season one and catch up or perhaps I could give you a short summation of how the show has evolved. As it opened we were there to see the arrival of up and coming attorney Alan Shore (James Spader) who was coming off of THE PRACTICE, another great law series that ended before it's time. Alan has just taken on a job with the firm and walks into what will become the usual turmoil as one of the senior partners has a breakdown. Get ready because this is the norm.Spader's Alan Shore is a campaigner. He believes in a number of things and is the voice of the writers as they use him to defend the little guy and take on the big guns. Everything from big tobacco to pharmaceutical companies is tackled by Shore by the end of the fifth year. But Shore is not your normal attorney. Instead he is prone to rampant rambling while he pursues the justice he seeks in each battle. He's also a letch of the highest order, viewing nearly every woman he sees as a conquest while at the same time emulating the highest respect for them all.Shore's biggest defender is the firm's high ranking senior partner, Denny Crane (William Shatner). Denny is perhaps the oddest character on the show. A womanizer as well, Denny is so self absorbed with his own fame that he often just says his name aloud with the expectation that in so doing he will intimidate any and all around him, which it usually does. Denny is also affected with what he calls ""mad cow"" disease, the early stages of Alzheimer's. As the show progresses, Denny and Alan become the greatest of friends.Into the fold comes Shirley Schmidt (Candice Bergen), the voice of reason. Shirley is another senior partner and at one time the love interest of Denny until she broke it off. Shirley stands for the calm voice in the firm, the one who puts their foot down to stop the ridiculous from happening but who rarely sees her expectations met.These are the three mainstays who began from season one and who remained until the end. Their interaction is tremendous, especially the friendship seen between Crane and Shore. Each episode ended with the two of them sitting on Denny's balcony in the office, enjoying a cigar and glass of scotch while they ruminated about things that happened during that episode. As the series progressed, you were witness to the closeness, the bond that developed between the two. Theirs was a unity rarely seen in even the best of marriages. As a matter of fact by the end of season five the pair was petitioning to use the same sex marriage to be joined in wedlock, not out of physical attraction but as a way to circumvent the laws concerning spousal support and decision making as well as current tax laws. These two men genuinely loved one another as much as two friends can.By season five we also had several other main characters involved. John Larroquette was there as Carl Sack, a rather stuffy lawyer and love interest for Bergen's Shirley. His character basically replaced that of Rene Abourjonois who was the bad guy in the beginning (and who returns by the end). But Carl becomes as comfortable a character as the rest by mid-season five, making Larroquette's character another that you would enjoy spending time with.Notable is Christian Clemenson as attorney Jerry Espenson. Suffering from a form of autism, Jerry began as a side character that walked the halls with his girlfriend, a mannequin he addressed as such. He developed into a character with obvious flaws that fought his own personal battles as well as those of his clients. The character came along with ticks and taps and pops, noises and movements he made including clutching his hands to his thighs, but in spite of those problems he was one that we all loved and wanted so much more for.Tara Summers rounded out the main cast members at the end portraying Katie Lloyd, an attorney given the task of assisting Espenson. She also became the object of his affection though he steered clear of letting her know. The usual plot device of sexual tension between two characters was turned on its ear here as the duo often seemed on the verge of actually becoming interested in one another but instead moved in the opposite direction. At least for Lloyd's perspective.All of the lawyers involved in this series were far from the normal lawyers we've become accustomed to over the years as seen on television. They were a quirky bunch who would take on cases ranging from client's whose parents died of cancer cause by smoking to that of an elderly lady attacking the networks for programming shows aimed only at the youth of America while omitting that made for older people, a segment they proved made up the vast majority of viewers. Yes, both of these topics came up in season five and made for interesting viewing.Season five also brought about a number of changes at the firm. Shirley and Carl decided to marry, much to the consternation of Denny who has longed to reunite once more with Shirley. The closeness between Denny and Alan, as noted earlier, became deeper as Denny moved from the early stages of Alzheimer's to a deeper onset. And the romance that had lied deep beneath the surface between Jerry and Katie began to show signs of becoming a reality.All lose ends were tied up nicely with a big bow by series creator David E. Kelly. And new possible threads were put into play when he made the firm about to close and facing bankruptcy. A buy out by the Chinese made for an interesting storyline as did Alan and Denny going before the Supreme Court one more time, the epitome of a lawyer's career, in the hopes of getting Denny the right to use non-FDA approved medication to stave off his disease.Of the characters in this series each offered something special that made you care about them all and want to continue to watch them. To single one out might be considered slighting the rest. But for me, William Shatner deserved the highest accolades for his performance as Denny Crane. Saddled with the mantle of being Captain Kirk for generations of TV and movie viewers and as police office T.J.Hooker for the children of the 80s, Shatner shined as Denny Crane. Never once can you see him here and think of either previous character, a major coupe for an actor to do so. Denny may not always make the right choices, but by the series end, you have to be heartless not to love him.While this may sound like numerous details of the show it falls far short. These were merely some of the high points in twelve episodes that brought the series to its rousing finale. And through it all the cast, crew and writers kept a tremendous sense of humor about it all, often joking through the characters about the end. More than once a character would ask ""Do you think this is a case we should take?"" only to get the response ""Why not, it's our last season"", tongue firmly planted in cheek each time.Who knows how long it will take for a series to reach the heights that this one did. I am sure one will come along. But that right combination of writing, setting, cast and crew is a rarity in today's TV land. Until such time comes along when this happens, make sure you keep BOSTON LEGAL alive. The entire series on DVD is worth owning. And this one, season five, caps off a run that should be talked about for years."
"Here we have a show that is funny, dramatic, and amazingly popular. Now, as if this were not enough, every episode from the first to the last, has been just totally brilliant. Moreover, this is one of the few respected shows that tackles real issues in a way that truly shows the intrinsic value of each issue. These are issues often buried by the main stream media, such as teen STD's (HIV), gay marriage, the truth about ""GITMO"" and how our rights are being eroded daily by a government that in my opinion has played the 9/11 card once to often.Furthermore, the show addresses serious debilitating issues like depression, As-burgers Syndrome, extreme shyness, agoraphobia and a plethora of others. Giving real hope to the many who suffer these maladies.Now, the cast, all wonderful actors and actresses. The guests are all well known guests. And, in my humble opinion the best thing that William Shatner has done since Star Trek.So, in short,  it's a great show. Has a great following. So, what does the network do? They cancel the show. A total shame, that any one would cancel a show with this much potential."
"After all the crazy court cases all the togetherness and yes after all the cheep shots at themselves(Words, guns and all). The firm of Crane, Poole & Schmidt had to close its doors. After five OUTRAGEOUS season 'Boston Legal' gives its loyal fans the perfect closing.Just as Carl Sack was beinging to like it up in Boston they finally discover they are broke and have to be bought out by a gigantic Chinesse conglomorite. At the very same time Denny finally has to face the hard truth that he now officially has Altzheimers. And of course, the great Alan Shore not only has to face the possibility of losing his job, but also losing his best friend the only question is how it will happen. The fifth season of this triumphant show really hits home and the heart. The bonds between the characters are as tight as they can be, hugs and all. Of course we can't have a final season with out prestigous guest stars such as Alan Ruck, William Daniels and Vallerie Burtenelli. The cases continue to range from the most serious to the outlandish along with great judges to make their own comments. The loose ends are tied up with a final trip to the U.S. Supreme Court where Alan Shore gives probably his most heartfelt rant and in the end....well I can't give that away now can I?Please, enjoy these final 12 gems of this truly smart and origional show. If you haven't yet get a chance to see the previous 4 seasons because who knows when another incredible show like this will ever come again."
"Inspector Morse isn't a likable character. He's snobby, intellectual and frequently less than kind to Lewis, his &#34;sidekick&#34; so to speak. Nonetheless this is a very watchable series, full of twists and turns, not like the pat formula detective/crime shows we're used to. Sometimes Morse is wrong or off track, only stereotype here is Morse's iffy relationship with his higher ups. As always, in shows about professionals who don't follow standard procedure or obey orders, Morse comes under fire....."
"See the review for season 6. Can't get enough of Morse. Such a loss when he passed away.  Will miss the excellentproduction, writing, and cerebral excellence."
Me like. You like too if you watch. We like together. Tell others. They like. Much goodness come from this...
"First one I've watched of Inspector Morse.  I guess he is the older version of Endeavor Morse - hard to tell.  I enjoyed this very much.  I have Amazon Prime so wasn't used to having to rent or buy, so I accidentally rented like Season 5 episode 1 rather than Season 1.  But guess that's okay.I will definitely be watching the rest of the seasons.  Good shows.  Also I like the cute younger version of Inspector Lewis.  Very handsome as he is in the later Inspector Lewis series.  GREAT SHOWS ALL."
"This season of five episodes starts off with a complex plot: a detective who is retired is writing a book about his old cases, all of them successfully resolved, but one.  He is killed, and the chapter goes missing.  As Morse and Lewis dig deeper and deeper, several possible suspects emerge as to who might like to keep the information quiet, and who has the most to lose if the secrets are uncovered regarding the circumstances surrounding the crime and why it was never resolved.These shows may seem slow-moving compared to current mysteries, but the magic is in the script and acting.  Morse always has wise observations and his face is a joy to watch as John Thaw underplays the subtle emotions."
Inspector Morse never disappoints.  His story leads to the inevitable conclusion without tremendously distractin complications or superhuman feats of strength.  Lewis always plays his part as his sidekick and together they make an umbeatable team.
"As the season goes on, the characters of Morse and Lewis are more deeply developed. Views of England and customs enjoyable."
"I just can't get enough of this series. He is so intelligent as is Sergeant Lewis his assisting officer. They have so much humanity and the underlying kindness and dignity they bring to the job is wonderful to watch. I also love the frequent classical music and the scenery is also wonderful. Taking place in Oxford makes it interesting to watch. The snobbery of some of the locals adds to the tension at times, but that car he drives....now I would love to sink into those leather seats just once for a spin through the coutnryside! Yes, Morse is the best. Morse is single and gives Lewis frequent problems as Lewis is married with two children. He has to really juggle the life to try to get home to the family. Often his personal dedication gets in the way as he too becomes obssesed with solving the crime. He is learning so much from Morse. He has even grown fond of the music which he once hated. Every season is worth watching."
"I never saw the Morse series when it was on TV, only heard it referenced in the INSPECTOR LEWIS series.  I finally decided that I needed to see the orginal.  It wears well in spite of the number of years since it was made, just like Morse's car !  I am encouraged to find DVD's of other series featuring Mr. Thaw as I hope they will continue to quality.  Also, the location of Oxford is marvelous.  I got the companion DVD MORSE's OXFORD for a closurte look - I will never be able to visit Oxford in person, but felt like I had a nice private guided tour after watching this."
It's as good as I remembered it from the original broadcast.  It is thought provoking.  Current for the era. PG rated.  Very entertaining.
"His stentorian declamation gets her all hot and bothered, and as for his musical taste, be still her beating heart!"
"I have stated oin several other Inspector Morse series and Endeavor series that it is always done exceptionally well.  I will say the creators had a wonderful way of allowing the main character die off and have another in place to carry on the tradition.  I see the same set up happening in Inspector Lewis and his side kick.  Except, its a little scary that both of them are talking about quitting."
"The Morse series finds its way into the very DNA of multivariate mystery  fans everywhere.To coin anew an oft quoted phrase from Britain, &#34;Never in the annals of Television Viewing have so many owed so much to so few!&#34;As the red Jaguar drifts off into the sunset over Oxford a legend passes into TV eternity.  How I wish this series could have continuedindefinitely but Time and the Man would not allow it. John Thaw's untimely passing made it so.  As much as I liked  Kevin Whatley's Inspector Lewis, Morse is still the ineffable Master and always will be. When comes such another?fch"
"The final true season of Morse comes to a brilliant end with three episodes. There would be five specials afterward from 1995-2000.In Deadly Slumber a young girl is left brain dead after a botched operation--and her father, brilliantly played by the Scottish actor Brian Cox, is heard openly threatening a husband and wife team of doctors who ran the private clinic where the incident took place. Morse, feeling profound empathy for their tragedy, gets caught up in the case which has brilliant twists and turns in addition to deeply ethical reverberations. The woman doctor is played by Janet Sussman, another wonderful performance.  One of the best Morses.In Day of the Devil, Morse and Lewis try to catch a Satanist serial rapist after his escape from an asylum--but there is so much more going on here than meets the eye as they discover too late. Very good.Twilight of the Gods, here an obnoxious Morse, who is constantly berating Lewis for his so called philistinism, gets a dose of medicine as his operatic idol is knocked off her pedestal and a business mogul is exposed for what he truly is. Wonderful, though I'm not sure why a Lithuanian would speak with a French accent, but it's a minor quibble.Like the other reviewer I really hope that Amazon acquires the specials-and soon!"
I agree with Jeeves! I hope Amazon gets permission to offer the rest of the series (12 in total) now that 'Endeavor' has become the prequel to Morse. Both are absolutely the best!
"Great DVD for any true American Dad fan! This DVD includes all of the episodes in American Dad season 4. The episodes are uncensored, which makes the viewing experience that much better! Great DVD, lots of jokes and laughs and a perfect gift! Zero complaints, watching the episodes never gets old!"
"This show pretty much seemed like a knock-off of Family Guy, and at first, it wasn't even as funny. But as the seasons went along, they decided to make the characters even more twisted than anything you see on Family Guy and this show really found it's stride. It's always taking a strange turn, just when you think you've got a handle on it and they do a tremendous job of keeping it funny. Give it time. This show is worth the wait."
No complaints.  Got a great price and good quality.  Have watched it several times.  Love the show.  If your looking for laughs you should watch the show.  I have watched these disks about 10 times and have not stopped working yet like dvds i bought at a big box store.
"American Dad was getting better with every season (or DVD volume) and now it has reached 5 star level.  The reason is that it is consistently clever and well-written.  There are many 5-star episodes here: ""Tearjerker,"" ""Office Spaceman,"" ""Stanny Slickers II: The Legend of Ollie's Gold,"" ""Spring Break-Up,"" ""The One That Got Away,"" and others that are solid 4-star.  I watch AD as often as I watch Family Guy and South Park.  Watching the episodes from this past season, it has now surpassed FG in writing and storylines.  Stan and Roger rule!  Now, here are the episodes:Disc 1:""Tearjerker""--James Bond takeoff where the main characters play different roles except Stan who plays himself, of course.  Roger is ""Tearjerker"" who has a plan to make everyone in the world cry themselves to death.  Can Stan and his new fiance stop him?  A lot of clever one-liners in this one.  My favorite: Francine's character asks Stan for a light and he pulls out a flashlight, ""Looks like you've got yourself a cigarette there.""  The opening credits are cool.""Oedipal Panties""--(Get it? Oedipus?) Stan's mom keeps getting dumped on the third date and she runs to Stan for comfort.  Stan and his mom's disturbingly close relationship and the fates of Stan's mom's boyfriends cause Francine and Roger to investigate.  Roger's fat woman costume is hilarious.""Widowmaker""--Francine wants Stan to share things with her like her friend's CIA husband who's gone missing.  When Stan complies, Francine finds out that some things are best kept to one's self.""Red October Sky""--Stan's Soviet nemesis before Communism fell (how old is Stan, anyway?) returns a converted Capitalist--until he gets hold of Steve.  Weak ending.  This is my least favorite of this volume.""Office Spaceman""--AD redeems itself with this episode. Roger poses as a photographer who has the uncanny ability of taking photos of a certain alien (himself).  He is hired by the C.I.A. to head the Alien Task Force.  Meanwhile, Francine throws out Steve's African American science partner but for different prejudicial reasons than the obvious.  Hilarious episode.  I like when Stan says, ""You have to take this seriously, both of our asses [Bullock walks in]...are equally nice, we both have nice butts.""Disc 2:""Stanny Slickers II: The Legend of Ollie's Gold""--After a near death experience, Stan is afraid he has left no legacy on the world, so he tears up his property looking for Oliver North's buried gold.  In the meantime, his daughter collects piercings and his son goes steady with a vacuum cleaner.""Spring Break-Up""--While Francine is away, Roger hosts an MTV Spring Break party at the Smith's and Stan hangs out with a frat girl who appreciates his jokes and quirks better than his wife.""1600 Candles""--Steve's going through puberty and, after the hell they went through with Hayley, Stan and Francine use their C.I.A. connections to postpone or prevent it.  Meanwhile, it's Roger's 1600th birthday and no one cares--well, one scaly friend does.""The One That Got Away""--One of Roger's personas has taken on a life of his own and, when he uses Roger's credit card, he experiences Roger's wrath.  Very creative story.  I like the Jimmy Stewart character, Sidney, and his girl Judi with her old school gangster girlfriend accent: ""figgas, I finally find the perfect fella and he's a fig newton of someone's imagination.""  I was told she is a takeoff of a character on ""The Little Shop of Horrors.""""One Little Word""--Stan becomes Bullock's #1 guy and he can't say no to his orders no matter how much they interfere with his family.  That Cocoa character is funny.Disc 3:""Choosey Wives Choose Stan""--(Remember that Jiff commercial?) When Stan finds out Francine was engaged to another man before they met, he fakes his own death to see if Francine will run off with her ex.  Also, Steve keeps being attacked by a stray cat.""Escape From Pearl Bailey""--Stan's girlfriend Debbie (is she going to be a regular character?  She just comes and goes) runs for student body president against Lisa Silver.  When she is slandered on the Internet, Steve takes revenge on Lisa and her cronies.  I like when Amy is driving down the hill and it appears Steve cut her brake line, ""Oops, that's the clutch.""""Pulling Double Booty""--Jeff breaks up with Hayley and she goes on a rampage.  To prevent future outbursts, Stan tries to find a man for her who is like himself.  It appears she finds the perfect man in Stan's eyes when she falls for his C.I.A. body double, Bill, until Bill tries to score with Francine.  Now Stan has to pose as Bill to keep Hayley sane.  Meanwhile, Steve has more bad luck with animals.""The Most Adequate Christmas Ever""--Know-it-all Stan dies chopping down what he views as the perfect Christmas tree and has to go to court while in Limbo for a second chance.  A silly episode but not terrible.Bonus Features: Deleted scenes that are best kept deleted.  ""Tearjerker: And Then They Will Cry""--The making of the James Bond episode, how the characters were created, etc. 15 minutes.""Roger: Master of Disguise""--Character designers, storyboard revisionists, the supervising director, etc. talk about Roger (my favorite AD character) which includes a discussion on his sxuality.  I like to think that Roger is to AD what Cartman is to South Park.  Cartman is without any moral conscience and therefore opens the door to a myriad of storyline possibilities.  Just as Cartman is capable of the most heinous of acts that anything he does works well with his character, Roger is so crazy that he is capable of getting into all sorts of predicaments and schemes and it works--not to mention all those disguises.  11 minutes.""Comic Con [2008]""--Live table reading of ""Pulling Double Booty."""
"Glad I got to watch it on Amazon Prime.  Wouldn't want to have to wait a week to see the next episode, much less wait for the next season to begin."
Great show and I wish they would have kept going on with season 5 plus... less immorality would be nice.
but I have integrated many of the characters into my internal compass. They help me to live into strength and courage. They remind me how to pray for those who put themselves in harm's way to keep us safe and secure. THANK YOU for an excellent series that ended much too soon!
"This show has got lots of everything. Excellent character development, each person has a very different and distinct persona, the men and the women. There is a lot going on in the field when The Unit goes into action, and there is a LOT of action and intrigue. Then there is always something going on back home which the women handle superbly with intelligence and wile. There's strength and awareness of each other and for each other. New relationships develop outside of the core group, some not what they seem. I've enjoyed every season of this show, many episodes more than once.."
The seasons have continued to get better and better. You never can guess what's coming and the action doesn't stop. My only complaint is that Season 4 was the last season and the last episode left me in Unit withdrawal for a couple days!  Wish they would come back for a reunion episode to close out some things.
"Just when I think they can't get any better, they go and get better still. I love these videos and will be very sad when I don't have any new ones to watch.  Keep them coming!!!"
"Very Good program. Well suited cast. Good writing. Keeps you watching. Never a dull moment, I wish It was still happening."
I love and loved this show.  It was so cheap of FOX and/CBS to cancel this show.  The Unit was the only military serial show I have ever gotten into mostly because the missions were such a huge part of the show and the family life a side dish  I don't think more seasons will ever be made and that is unfortunate.
"Best show of this type I have ever enjoyed.  To bad the geniuses at Fox tv cancelled it.  Though such an off the grid Unit, if it existed could be a very dangerous tool in the wrong hands , I love the show.I would like to think there is a part of the Delta Force or the navy Seals out there somewhere that operates this way.  However since the Tragedy of Benghazi  occurred the way it did , with politicians and political motives taking priority over protecting American lives , I doubt seriously if there is such a Team that serves up some justice,  Unless it benefits  some politician."
I wish that this series was still ongoing.  I guess it would have been hard to keep story lines going over several more seasons as this one was played out.  Some issues still remain though should an enterprising writer and producer team up to go on.  The characters are fabulous.  Well done and highly recommended.
This season has lots of twists & turns & you will not want to miss a second of it. It is nail biting good. I can't wait til Season 5 can be available.
The excitement was great.  Love each episode.  Wish there was a season 5.Hate it when one of the good guys gets killed.
"If you enjoy military action movies, this is where you want to be. I purchased 4 seasons so I could watch them when and where I want. Check out one series and you will come back for more."
The writing made the complete series enjoyable to watch.It seemed that each episode was really hapenning now or could in the near future.
I watched the first season and found it to be enjoyable. The second season turned me off so I did not continue. I tried the first episodeof season four and found it as exciting as season one. The writers of season four did an excellent job. It is well worth your time to watch. Sit back and enjoy.
"Great series, I loved all the characters. I'm not usually into macho movies, but could not stop watching it. Hope they make more like this."
A few cast changes but still are great show. What more can I say... Wish there were more seasons? *
"Can't wait for Season 4 to come out. Since it has been cancelled, has to watch this good show on DVD!! Maybe someone will pick up this good show!!"
"I loved this. Great action, great stars and wonderful outcomes. I especially appreciate the absence of profanity, obscene language and nudity. Can't wait till season 5!"
best military series on TV too bad they discontinued it!!! Great acting and great story line!
"I  love this show. I wish it had lasted longer than 4 seasons. Dennis Haysbert is terrrific and that voice of his is wonderful!!!! No wonder he is the spokesperson for All State Insurance.  The stories are very interesting and are concluded each episode with general ties go the next episode. Also included is the stories of their wives, which makes it even more interesting."
This has become one of our family's great TV favorites.Superbly done.  Can not understand why they would havecanceled this program.
The Unit season 4 has really up'ed the ante for a secret military action packed series.  I have not always cared for the wives part in the series but was amazed with a well put together series that showed their intelligence and &#34;stand by your man&#34; character.  It got a 5 star rating because it produced a solid written story that was interesting and amusing. It caused me to become addicted to what happens next.  A great series you won't want to miss.
"What were they thinking by canceling this show??  We were addicted to it and the characters in it, especially those inside the Unit.  Fantastic acting, my two favorites were Max Martini and Michael Irby. There are so many mindless shows on TV and they go and cancel a solid one like this?  It makes no sense.  If CBS can do this, don't watch new series on their network anymore because who is to say they won't yank the rug out on those too just when you are getting into it.  The actors who made this show as awesome as it was and the audience deserved more.5 stars for this awesome show, below 0 stars for CBS."
Just as exciting and addictive as all the other seasons. I love this show and wish it was still on television
"I loved the Unit, every season was great! I really loved the dialog and all the charactors. The lead guys are all awesome. I lived the whole show with them."
Wow! Patriotism - God - self sacrifice. The producers certainly are out of step with most TV and Hollyweird. Refreshing and entertaining.  Brings home how poorly we treat out military and their families.
"Great show overall. Some episodes are better than others but the Unit is a good mix of drama, action & adventure where the good guys usually come out on top."
It's ashamed that this series had to end. A bit of a unique twist surrounded the entire season so you were really kept guessing with not onl the soldiers but the wives... and not just who they are sleeping with.  Great ending to a great series.
"I collected and revisit the first three season of this fine series. In those first seasons the plots occasionally slid in soap operatic's, straining focus and credulity. Good as the shows were, they seemed to evade perfection for catering to a wider audience.This final season seems driven by wanting to go out with a roar, not a whimper.No compromises while production values soared, plotting and writing seemed morelike I'd expect from a brilliant talent like David Mamet. By the way, a fine feature film showing his writing/producing excellence would beSpartan.THE UNIT Season Four's episodes are grittier, more realistic and certainly more consistently entertaining. I hope some non-Network executives pick up and run with this fine series.If you like such military action, you might also consider OVER*THEREOver There (13 Episodes), from Steven Bochco of NYPD BLUE fame. The series didn't last a year; no doubt because its authenticity was, if not politically incorrect in depicting the ironies of the Mid-East wars, the depictions of gut-wrenching battle conditions and ambiguities of the rightness/ wrongness of the politics involved.Both aborted series seemed aimed for the Soldier of Fortune macho market; SOF people I've spoken with re these two fine prematurely-pulled series swear by them. But they swear at or about anything."
each episode is unique in itself and you want to see more. the families have a big responsibility of protecting their men in service and keeping quiet about the unit. the men in the field are quick and respond with efficiency. as I said it's a must see. good writers and excellent actors. I didn't want the last episode to end. I wanted more and to see molly and her husband reunite.
"all the way to the last episode, I truly enjoyed I would like to join other friends who want the show back before too long!"
The last episode is very telling for the lead character and his wife - unanticipated !!!Will they ever get back together?
This was an action packed series and the last season was as good as the first. I liked the technique of two stories running in parallel. The personal interactions of people and friends and wives with their various problems was very realistic. he series skips the long hours of boring training and life between hot action.
"A very well written show.  I was more than a little sorry to see it end. I'm sure there were more good stories to tell.  The actors were 'real' although some of the story lines were a bit fantastic, but we can read the newspapers for the 'real' stuff."
"You will love this series if you love action, drama, suspense, loyalty, to each other. It has a some deceit but not between the men in the unit itself. We can't wait to watch the next episode."
I still can't believe this show was cancelled this season. With 12 different cop shows staying on forever the one about special forces with good characters gets cancelled? I still enjoy watching this show time after time.
I found this series to be so unbelievable and boring that I didn't finish the DVD.  Some people will enjoy it a lot.
"I don't want to give too many spoilers but this was a really interesting little series, two totally distinct personalities in the same body and they discover and then communicate with each other by leaving video messages........One of the personalities is a meek, mild Mr.Nice Guy and the other is a ""rockem sockem"" secret agent who would make James Bond blush.........the fun really starts when the ""secret agent"" personality spends the night with the ""Nice Guy"" personality's wife............it's too bad that they didn't continue the series."
"Christian Slater has had a knack through his career of landing in too many so-so movies. It is nice to see at this stage of his career he turns in one of his best performances. The supporting cast is good with Mike O'Malley being especially interesting. The budget seems to be decent.Like the somewhat similar British series Jekyll the most interesting aspect of the series is the conflict between two apparently separate people inhabiting the same body. Edward, the Bond-like spy, is ruthless, and Henry, the family man, has never handled a gun. They do not seem to care much for each other but as they only have one body they find they must work together to stay alive. Everything was fine until Henry, previously unaware of Edward, discovers Edward's existance in the first episode. That they now switch back and forth at any moment is the tale.The last episode appeared to be working its way to a conclusion, but in the final two minutes they throw a curve. The show is good, worth watching on its own, but it would be nice to see a second season."
"Yes, the concept is tricky; but it was ably smoothed out after the first episode. Everything was improved (they were five stars start to too-soon finish.) So MY OWN WORST ENEMY joins FIREFLY and a long list of other too-good-for-the-Networks.MY OWN WORST ENEMY is, er, was a great series. Their quality showed in every episode - their international locations and consistently fine components (noted in the title, above)would have found an audience eager for such quality. And Slater was a charismatic, forceful lead; at the same time, believable as a domesticated wage slave and a covett operative. I hope Network management reads the comments of disappointed viewers; for MY OWN WORST ENEMY and the many prematurely axed shows which have been inappropriately turned into history.Methinks that Network canceling executives have a very dim view of their viewers. Foolish, too. Considering start-up investments of producers and Networks, this badtaste by TV execs is wasting so much money; no wonder America is in a recession.( EXPLETIVE DELETED  )  ( Sigh )"
"Once again, a good piece of television programming succumbs while the hog-wall'er, bitch-slap, scripted reality world continues to spin out of control with overly fed tow truck drama queens, pawn shops seeing more action than a mid-town police station at 11:30 at night, over wrought cooking/contestant/dancing/prancing/etc. nit-wittery  and Scooby-Doo ghost hunters. I don't watch much television because, after an hour of cringing at any overt banality that currently enthralls and keeps the masses in a stupor of stupidity, my whole body cramps up.This show had more than a one note tune going on. Christian Slater filled out the Henry/Edward character very admirably and the supporting cast was, pretty much, top-notch, as well. Once introduced to the show, I was hooked and loved the tension built upon the uncertainty of who would manifest at any inconvenient moment.Smart, tense, well scripted with enough of a salt shake of humor to insure enough pathos to find Henrys'/ Edwards' dilemma compelling enough to continue watching each episode.Ah, well, .... more time to read a good book.Continue enjoying your pop-pablum crap, folks ......  ""I do believe there's a 'squatch in these woods, ...."" . Feel free to step in that 'squatch."
This was easily the best DVD to come out all year! It's an awesome concept that's the classic comic book brought to life like no Hollywood attempt could ever conceive. While the narration is performed by just one actor it's still wonderfully done & its setting the stage for next wave of entertainment. I hope DC puts out more releases like this becuase motion comics are gonna be huge!
"The movie was dark & depressing.Who wants to be depressed?I want to be entertained.The modified comic version was superior.It was well colored ... bright ... splashy ... in your face.I picked up more details about the movie.The comic version had the same plot, so don't think it's something else.There was a blatant ad for Black Freighter in the movie ... LOLTalk about ad placement.The only creepy part was the narrator doing female parts.Come on guys, spend $5 to get a hooker to read the parts.This is where Rorschach needs to come take care of the narrator.;)bundle of 2 = 2 DVD set"
I do not understand why this show was cancelled.  It had me both in stitches and on the edge of my seat to see what antics the characters were going to get themselves into.  I would love it if they brought this show back with all the original cast.
This is about the life of a once rich single mom and how she tries to raise her daughter in this new life she was forced in
Its a Soap Opera for sure.  But it is more like &#34;Sex in the City&#34; than junk.  And it deals with real issues in a fascinating and highly entertaining way.
"This is just a fun show to watch, enough substance to keep you interested, enough comedy to keep it funny, and enough craziness to keep you wondering what is going to happen next!"
"I enjoyed the light humor and human stories of this series. It is funny, and imaginative. Very entertaining. It makes me laugh."
"I loved this series!  Debra Messing was exceptional and I loved the entire story.  It was funny, witty, and heart rendering. I am not from L.A. so I can't really saw whether or not folks from there are so shallow, but found that part of it amusing, and entertaining because some of the shallow stuff was just plain silly, great for a giggle. The story itself delves into the subject of  how your life can change on a dime and how difficult it is to retain your dignity while trying to change.  I identified with the concept of reinventing oneself, as I have had to do it many times.  I highly recommend it as a chick flick series."
"I must tread lightly here, in order to not let any spoilers out of the bag.The first thing for which I give the writers credit is how they finish a series premise which does not have a natural ending, such as the end of Jeb Bartlett's term as president, and the election of a new president on &#34;The West Wing.&#34; I will say that it ends with one great arc traceable to the early seasons and to Noah Wyle's career and family.By the time the season is over, virtually all the lead characters return in some way or other, and are seen in one or more episodes, even those who died or were killed in the course of the show, such as Mark Green and Robert Romano.One aspect of ER to which I never quite adapted was the large number of major cast roles who either died, were seriously injured, left under a cloud, or were fired for some reason or other. To be sure, when the whole show is based on what walks in the main entrance on the spur of the moment, being either a seriously ill patient or an irascible new boss, you need a lot of things going on among the principle characters to maintain an interesting show. And, in a long running show, sooner or later, cast members must move on.This season is no different, but it is balanced by a really rewarding finale.The major in-season arc involves  Catherine Banfield, the new head of the ER, played by Angela Basset and Courtney B. Vance as Russell Banfield, her husband. Both are strong, and hold up their end, but perhaps not as strong in the role as head of the ER as William H. Macy and Stanley Tucci, each in their own way.In all, the show certainly goes out with a bang. I'm surprised no one has created a spin-off; however, I suspect most cast members have probably had their fill of the ER."
"ER is the one and only Medical show that will stand out for all time. And N.B.C put there head up there butt one more time by giving it the boot. And trying to put some other Medical trash in it place( NBC).( New But More Crap). And they took off Law and Order. A flag ship show, just like ER. But that is ok. I will have all 15 seasons of ER very soon, like in a week. And I can start at season one and watch it all over again. 95% of the stuff on tv now is trash..Really no need for Cable now!"
"The final season of ER. The scripts remain as good as they were in year one. The cast has changed almost completely but the city of Chicago and its down and out are still co-stars. Ending a series that lasted 15 seasons is like the death of an old friend. I have no clue as to the authentisticty of the medical terminology used or the procedures performed by the actors but what is never in doubt is the humanity of the characters they portrait. These have always been real people with good days and bad days. They make mistakes, they have temper tantrums, they are kind, caring, health care professionals. They have problems at home, they have inter-personal issues, they attempt to rise above it all. In the final few episodes we make contact with many former doctors in an attempt at closure. We see the memorial wall in the basement. In the end the show ends appropriately with all hands on deck dealing with the fall-out from an industrial explosion. How else could it be in an ER."
"With this purchase, I have now purchased all 15 seasons of this wonderful series.  I'm not in the medical field, but this drama gave me a greater appreciation of it.  NBC did a wonderful job.  The actors and actresses in this 15 year series were some of the best.  Thank you also to Amazon for providing me with some of the DVD's.  I hope that those of you who read this review are as big a fan as I am of this show, and that your collection is complete as well."
"I have always looked at ER as two different series.  One that lasted through season 8 when Anthony Edwards decided to leave the show and the one that remained on the air until the end.  Personally I would have liked to have seen the show end after the 8th season.  I think had the shows that told the story of Dr Green's death been the series finale the show would have gone out on a high point and would have never been accused of hanging on too long.That said, season 15 blends the two series together.  For those of us that were fans from the beginning, it brought back many of the old cast including a flashback episode that could bring Anthony Edwards back for an entire show (as well as Paul McCrane and Laura Innes for cameos), as well as appearances by Eric LaSalle, Sherry Stringfield, Alex Kingston, George Clooney, Julianna Margulies, and Noah Wyle (for several episodes).  It also wrapped up the story lines for the current cast.Many people complain about the episode in which Clooney was brought back.  I think it was the best that could be done to give him his ""own"" episode where he could do more than just make a cameo appearance in the finale like Sherry Stringfield, Alex Kingston, and Laura Innes did.  While the story line was contrived and would not happen in real life it was really the only way, aside from having Carter go out to Seattle, to have a reason for someone from County to be interacting with those characters.  Given that he was really 1a and/or 1b along with Anthony Edwards on the show in the early years I think it was better to do what they did so he could be in more than just one or two scenes.I think the way the show ended with Morris (of all people) taking over as the lead character, and having Carter passing the baton (so to speak) to Dr. Green's daughter who had become a prospective medical student was the best way to end the series.  It was perfect to have Noah Wyle be the last person we see on screen since the show started with his character as the wide eyed medical student back in episode 1."
I love this series it is wonderful the actors are amazing and the storylines are great I would recommend this to anyone
It's great wholesome super funny value thats sure to tickle your funny bone time and time again definitely recommend watching it!
My ten-year-old loves this show and I am so glad he can watch it now that it's off the air on Amazon. Cute!
My kids from 9 to 19 all love to sit down and watch this show. They can watch episodes over and over!
This is a smart show for kids. It doesn't make you feel all gross with some kind of silly moral to the story.  It knows how to have fun and let you in on it too:)!
My daughters watched this show and loved it. They didn't have any problems downloading it and it didn't have to buffer during it. Recommend to older children.
"Silly, somewhat far-fetched? Yes, but so much fun for my 12 and 14 yr old... and really between video games and the internet, I'd take iCarly any day!"
"Unlike many shows for kids and pre-teens on television, I actually like iCarly and have no problem watching it with the kids. Season 2 is my favorite season to date. The characters have already been developed, and they build on existing relationships, including Gibby. Spencer is our favorite character on the show. It's not too crazy for younger kids, and it has enough entertainment value to it that adults can sometimes watch it without wanting to jump off a building."
We always watch Diego together and the time goes very quickly.  They teach her kindness and compassion and that animals sometime need our help too.
My daughter loves every episode.  We have watched them all a ton of times!Would recommend to a parent of a toddler.
"All the seasons deserve 5 stars even when on every episode there is an animal in trouble and Diego rescue it, it's interesting for little kids"
I can't count the many times my grandson--who just turned three--has watched this video. He watches it over and over.
This is a very cute show for kids to learn with! They will have fun while they learn about all kinds of animals
"I dont recall the exact episodes in season two and am not going to use this time to double check my memory, but we're watching season 6 now since all of the previous episodes were stimulating learning experiences for my child!"
My granddaughter is a fan of Go Diego when she comes to my house she asks to watch it.  She is 3 1/2 and will sit through the whole show. she likes the adventure shows! So anything Diego is a hit.
My son loves this show. He is learning Spanish as well by watching it. Amazing. He likes this show better then dora now.
"My three year old grand daughter absolutely loves these, and she learns about all kinds of exotic animals.  When asked, she says, &#34;Diego, please&#34;."
"This show is a must watch for children because it emulates the care and love that we should have for animals and this world as  a whole. Diego also helps with a few spanish words here and there, though I think the bigger picture of his adventures is how he rescues and protects the animals in the wild. This show will not only teach your children about the ways of certain animals in the wild (and there is always an actual picture of the animal the episode was about at the end of each show), but will also plant a seed of charisma towards all animals."
My 2 yr old grandson loves watching Diago. This is a great program that helps kids learn some verbal skills.
My 3 yr old loves this show! It is both entertaining and educational. The variety of animals that they teach about is great.
"Our little one always goes to&#34;Go, Diego, Go&#34; first. She knows the song and always answers the questions. I like the way she is learning about animals and having fun too."
Again and again Diego appeals to the young children with his adventures. His gentle ways are laced with humor kids get.
"It is my grandkids fvorite show. Gret music, theme adventure, always positive and helping the environment. It is a wonderful program for children."
My 2 year old granddaughter purchased this when she was supposed to be watching Amazon Prime selections but she loves these episodes so much I cant complain. It is educational and interactive.  Great for preschoolers!
I'm a nanny an when the kids want to watch tv I'm glad I have prime so the can watch this.
"My son is 3 and he likes this show.  His attention span is pretty short, so he usually doesn't make it through an entire episode in one sitting, but he sure loves the theme song!  :)"
My 5 year old is in love with Diego. It's a great show.  He loves learning about all the animals.
My kids love this show! We have a smart TV and are able to stream it. The stream was seamless... you wouldn't even know it!
"My daughter is very particular about her kids even watching TV, but this is one of the shows that is ok for them to watch and they really enjoy it."
"Really, all I can go by is that my grandson keeps asking me to watch Deigo. I don't sit and watch it with him but I can hear him calling out the answers to Diego's questions and when it over he wants to watch another. I have seen a few episodes and I like how they get the child involved and it is actually a teaching show. So they are not just sitting numbly spaced out watching cartoons. One time I purposely called out the wrong answer and he corrected me! Great. I was just checking to make sure he was understanding. He is 2 1/2 years."
Go Diego go! My son loves to watch Diego and pretend that he is also on a mission to rescue an animal.
My son loved watchin it with so many episodes its great. These is great for the kids and having it on xbox is awesome
"This Batman series has got to be one of the most under appreciated, at least for its time, a solid 65(64) episodes in total, 13 (might just be 12 I can't remember) of which were made as an encore season after the second season finished. This batman reminds me of the Bruce Timm DCAU batman with a twist of Adam West, and a dash of batman beyond's gear. As far as similarities to the comics, well their really aren't many this batman like almost all TV versions of him has to be toned down for kids. If you watch this and find this batman to be a little to cheerful, feel free to buy/rent  ""The Dark Knight"" parts 1+2. That's what batman is like in the comics."
"It's finally here. The collection that we have been waiting on for nearly four years has finally arrived, and its almost everything that I could have asked for. To be perfectly honest, I didn't think we would ever see Batman: The Brave and the Bold in the glorious hi-def picture that we so richly deserved. The only downside is that, again, this set sadly lacks the special features that were absent on the dvd collections as well.The picture and sound quality are wonderful, seeing as this show was gorgeous in the first place. This set is the COMPLETE first season, not the half season releases we saw with the DVD collections. There really isn't much to say beyond this. Batman the brave and the bold is a fun, bright, imaginative, absolute blast of a TV show, and now its finally on Blu-ray. It is a great show, and deserves to be in your collection. A treasure and an absolute must buy."
I love this movie! The online viewing is very crisp and clear. I bought it on sale. Very pleased with my purchase!
"I never get tired of watching this one. Such a good story and the acting....wow. Although a very old movie, this is one that got me watching other oldies.  Very, very good!!!!!"
This is one of the best movies of all times. A feel good movie that you can watch forever and ever and not get tired of. Great for the whole familh
"I have always tried to watch this movie every Christmas since I was a teenager.  I am so busy now, that I have trouble watching it on TV. I rented this movie and watched it on my PC when I had some free time. Very good quality."
is there really any one who hasnt seen this classic but if you havent you have to see it i just need to remind you this is an old movie
Everyone needs to own this movie in it's original version...black and white.  It is something I watch every Christmas.  The best Holiday movie ever made with my two favorite actors...and zuzu too!
I always tear up when I see this movie.  It just never gets old.  I'll add another 5-star rating to the pile.
"When I saw the first Flashpoint episode, I was totally sucked into the action. It is a compelling series that I thoroughly enjoyed."
I had never watched this show before and was quite surprised and please to see how good it was.  I really like the interaction between the actors and intensiveness of each show.  I plan to watch all the seasons.  Thanks for having this part Prime Video.
Action packed and true to life....I love this series.  The characters are true to life and so are the scenarios...great show!
"I love this series. I have watched the entire series 3 times now. Of course I am old and don't remember all the episodes...lolNot only is each episode exciting, but, there are personal connections that you get hooked on."
"I completely enjoyed every episode of this outstanding Canadian series.  In Canada this show is in its third season.  Unfortunately, only the first is available on DVD in the USA.  A very strong cast plays a crisis team in Toronto which is called into action every time an individual hits the flashpoint, i.e. he or she becomes a source of imminent danger to himself or others.  This covers a wide array of situations, settings and people.  One of the things I like best about this show is that it is gutsy enough to show when their efforts do not work. We get to see them fail. The actors are top notch as well.  With the exception of the newest young guy member to the team, they are more notable for their acting ability than their looks, which is refreshing.  These people look like they could be real life workers and not tv stars. I highly recommend you give this a try.Tip: On a related note, I found another show by looking up the further work of Hugh Dillon from this show.  Turns out he is simultaneously starring in another Canadian tv drama called DUNHAM COUNTY.  I watched two seasons of that show and it is even better than this one!  Only problem is that it is not available on DVD in USA yet, which is why I have no way of reviewing it here."
"Awesome series, I loved it when it was on regular TV, and got moved to a different network. I have watched the entire 1st season."
"Love police shows. This show was always full of drama, suspense and made you think like you were in their shoes. Wish it was still on the air."
Really enjoyed watching this show. Got us hooked from the first show and have enjoyed the whole season. Would recommend.
"I didn't realize until I was 15 minutes into the first episode that it was filmed in Canada. I haven't watched all of season 1, but I have watched enough to know it is a very tight drama.  Characters are fantastic and believable.  I do like that they finish each story while continuing to develop the main characters a little at a time.  I was also surprised to see it was on TV for 5 seasons.  Hmm, well missing it then is making it a great way to catch up now.  Well worth watching."
"Flashpoint is a terrific show, a Canadian-produced updated version of the mediocre 1970's cop show ""Swat.""  The difference between the shows is that Flashpoint is not just another shoot-em-up, it is a show in which you care about the characters: the victims who must be rescued by this elite police unit and the police officers themselves.Each show begins the same way.  We start at a point, the flashpoint, wherein the unit must take immediate action and then jump backward several hours to see what led up to this situation.  The show is well-produced, well-written and well-cast.  The lead actor is a Canadian actor and musician, Hugh Dillon, who plays Ed Lane, the family-man who seems to be the sniper of the team.  The female lead is Amy Jo Johnson, the original Pink Ranger from the Power Rangers and the head of the team is terrifically played by Enrico Colantoni, the actor who previously played Veronica Mars' father.  The technology shown in this show is terrific.  I don't know whether most of it is real or not but if it is real, I don't know how criminals stand a chance.There is not a bad episode in the bunch.  The set includes a couple of short films about the creation and production of the show.I cannot wait for CBS to bring this terrific show back again, I heard today it might be first returning in the summer.  Whenever it returns I'm sure the new episodes will be just as good as the episodes in this set.If you have not seen any episodes of Flashpoint, grab this set.  You will not be sorry."
"this is one show that teaches you that team work is very important, and how to work together no matter what."
"Like watching this show, could be dramatic.  If your into cop shows you will like this one.  Hope you enjoy as much as I did."
I would recommend this series to anyone wanting a new series to watch to fill in free time and also introduces new characters from Canada.
"My husband and I love off-beat shows like &#34;Life&#34;, &#34;The Finder&#34; and others of that ilk. But I have said for a long time that I miss &#34;Hill Streets Blues&#34;. This is HSB up-dated and in HD. I think there should be a law that every police person in the entire world be as kind, patient, understanding and willing to give folks the benefit of the doubt as the character Greg Parker does. He also orders bad guys deaths but only as a last resort. My father was a highway patrolman and a sheriff so I know that good law-enforcement is possible. This show has a huge heart and lots of grit."
I'm enjoying watching a few episodes every few days. I missed a lot of this series when it was on. I think it's a great show showing that police officers are people too and have feelings and emotions like any other human being.
"Good scripts and likable characters, real situations with excellent acting. What more could you want from a network television show!"
I just started watching Flashpoint three weeks ago when I was on 10 days bed rest. Shame on me! This is one of the best shows I've seen in a long time. I don't know how it got by me for all those years. Right from the very first minute of the very first season it rocked. I'm almost at the end of the third season and it still rocks! The Characters all click; each actor is so perfectly suited to their role. I honestly can't say one negative things about Flashpoint except that the show is no longer being made! This could have easily been a 10 year run. Anyway - well worth your time if you're into this type of genre.  Yummy stuff!
have seen parts of this series on t.v. and it's better being able to watch on kindle fire. the show keeps your attention and you get to see what actually goes on with a special unit to fight crime.
"Great story, great acting and the different shows make you aware these happen in everyday life! Watching the episodes instills in me to always be aware of what is going on around me."
Typical in all the right ways. I really enjoy watching this show and the character building of the cast works well for flow and weekly development
"I'm floored.  Season 1 of Flashpoint is over, and I think it may be the best overall cop show I've seen.  No, it might not have the totalitary coverage of The Wire, the seedy-ness of The Shield, or the multiple angles of the Law and Order series(es).  But, it manages to be action-oriented, believable, never dumbed-down, emotional, and relavent.  I'm not a cop, but I would bet money that police that do watch the show find many of the issues presented to be dealt with in a way that no other show has.Acting and writing are where Flashpoint rise to a very high (Sierra 1?) spot.  The conversations are believable and flow without really much  that is unnecessary.  All the characters have a genuiness about them, and bring multiple facets to the team that enrich the show without falling into cliche' and stereotype. I didnt think I'd gravitate towards the negotiation and psychological aspects of each incident, but I've come to find those some of the most interesting aspects about it.  They do a really good job immersing you and bringing credibility to what they say and how they say it.There are a few petty things I hesistate to even mention, because I think they present themselves to blatantly only because the rest of the show is so damn perfect.  A couple of the negotiations get a little too heartelt (most are perfect though, especially the second to last episode, perhaps the most heartfelt of all) and the ""last-three-minutes-song-of-the-week-montage"" was very, very 2008 (everyone did it then, House, Grey's Anatomy, etc, etc, etc) but hopefully they phase this out in subsequent seasons.I'm continually amazed at the caliber of shows on TV these days; everytime I am sure television will fall into the trap that movies have (rehashing stuff that isnt even worth rehashing), along comes a show like Flashpoint that knocks me down and draws me in in a way few movies do anymore.  I watched the first season on-demand, but its going to be a purchase, because its one that has taken its place in my heart and mind as a ""best-of"" type of show, and I'd be proud to give it a prominent place on the movie shelf.I simply can't recommend this show enough."
"You got to love Leverage!This show is a modern day Mission Impossible (Mission Impossible: The Sixth TV Seasonis the current release of the classic show). The team plays these caper straight but there are so many laughes and twists of the tale.Timothy Hutton channels his inner Jim Phelips as Nat Ford, The mastermind of the operation. Gina Bellamn as the grifter Sophie Devereaux who can steal your heart as well as your wallet. Beth Riesgraf is Parker , Who channels her inner Alexander Mundy (It Takes a Thief). Christian Kane plays Elliott Spencer , the hitter , who is brain and well as muscle but cannot work a computer. To roound out the cast is Aldis Hodge as Hardison, the hacker who can find a file in the world wide web.Those who love caper movies this show is like a mini in 50 minutes.Always remember as you watch this show that the best Good guy is a bad guyBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
"I think that whenever you love a television show, you should get the DVD as homage to a show that you loved but also because of the DVD extras. First, the weakness of this DVD set is that there doesn&#8217;t appear to be any cast member commentary which is a shame because there are occasions when watching the show that I wonder why a cast member made a particular choice or how much fun did a cast member (or couple of cast members) have in a scene. So I hate not having them there to explain their view point. With that said, I love hearing the producers, directors, and writers provide input on scenes and/or the process to get to a scene.The contributors are a chatty group so make sure that you&#8217;ve watched the episode so many times that you know what&#8217;s going on without hearing. And they appear to have made a conscious decision to not &#8220;watch&#8221; the show rather to comment. So they aren&#8217;t watching the show with you they are talking about what went on behind the scenes. They talk about some of the infamous Hardison scenes and Aldis&#8217;s improvational skills which they really love and trust. They talk about Pardison and conscious decisions that were made to be physically stand next to one another to show their growing relationship. That talk about Kane humor and the humorous actions and expressions that he brings to Eliot that I had never really thought about. They discuss sibling relationships (Eliot, Parker, Hardison) the father/son dynamic between Nate and Hardison, and the &#8220;equals&#8221; relationship between Eliot and Sophie/Nate. These are things that you saw as a fan but it&#8217;s good to hear it discussed.I&#8217;m only on season two but it is the conspiracy episode where the reporter has ruined a guy&#8217;s career so the team sets out to discredit the reporter. In the episode, Parker becomes curious about conspiracies and begins to ask Eliot about different conspiracies. Not sure who it was but someone mentioned that he sent a note to a big wig and asked, &#8220;How is Eliot responding to Parker.&#8221; The reply came back, &#8220;Like a big brother effing with his baby sister.&#8221; It&#8217;s something that we saw but it was nice to hear that response.As indicated, I&#8217;m only on season 2 but I&#8217;m so pleased with my decision to purchase this. I purchased seasons 1 - 3 together because the 5 season bundle wasn&#8217;t offered. But I&#8217;m going to have to get season&#8217;s 4 and 5 soon because I am watching a season a weekend. It&#8217;s a shame that TNT cancelled this show because it really was a fun show to watch."
"Steal from the rich and give back to those who deserve it, giving those who have no chance some leverage.""LEVERAGE"" is the hit TV drama series on TNT executive produced by Dean Devlin (""Godzilla"", ""Independence Day"" and ""Universal Soldier""), Chris Downey (""The King of Queens"") and John Rogers (""Cosby"") and also to see involvement by Jonathan Frakes (""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", ""Roswell"") as a director and Amy Berg (""The 4400') as a writer/producer.""LEVERAGE"" stars Academy Award winner Timothy Hutton (""The Good Shepherd"", ""Ordinary People"" and ""The Last Mimzy""), Christian Kane (""Angel"", ""Close to Home""), Aldis Hodge (""Red Sands"", ""Friday Night Lights""), Gina Bellman (""Coupling"", ""Jekyll"" and ""Permanent Vacation""), Beth Riesgraf (""Struck"") and Mark Sheppard (""Battlestar Galactica"" and ""Dollhouse"").The series also features quite a bit of talent which include Mark A. Sheppard (""Battlestar Galactica) as James Sterling, Nate's former business partner and now rival. Kari Matchett (""24', ""Heartland"" and ""Invasion"") as Nate's ex-wife Maggie,  ""Star Trek"" talents Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Armin Shimerman.  And appearances by Lauren Holly, D.B. Sweeney, Sara Rue, Jeremy Roenick and many more.The series would become a major hit for TNT as it became the #1 program on Tuesday nights with solid ratings for the drama series.""LEVERAGE"" features the following episodes on four discs:Disc 1:* EPISODE 1 - The Nigerian Job - The first episode that shows us how the group came together for the first time.* EPISODE 2 - The Homecoming Job - A military reserve who was filming private military contractors are ambushed by them.  The Reservist who was filming the contractors hires Leverage to get them to pay for his rehabilitation bills.* EPISODE 3 - The Wedding Job - An innocent man died for a mafia boss and the wife of the man wants the money promised to them and hires Leverage for their help.Disc 2:* EPISODE 4 - The Snow Job - A National Guardsman hires Leverage to find justice on the construction firm that foreclosed on his home.* EPISODE 5 - The Mile High Job - A young girl has died due to what may be because of toxic fertilizer.  But because the corporation behind the fertilizer is covering things up, Leverage is brought in to give the girl's family some leverage.* EPISODE 6 - The Miracle Job - Nate's friend and former priest has his church about to be razed by a real estate developer, can Leverage help this church in need?DISC 3:* EPISODE 7 - The Two-Horse Job - A Wall Street broker burns down his stable of under performing racehorses in order to get money, meanwhile the trainer suspects foul play and hires Leverage.* EPISODE 8 - The Bank Shot Job - While investigating a corrupt judge, Nate and Sophie get caught up and become hostages in a bank robbery.* EPISODE 9 - The Stork Job - The Leverage group go after a Serbian adoption agency that are scamming desperate American couples looking to adopt war orphans.* EPISODE 10 - The Juror #6 Job - Parker attends jury duty and notices something strange at the trial.DISC 4:* EPISODE 11: The 12-Step Job - The team investigate an investment broker who has swindled a charity.* EPISODE 12: The First David Job - Nate targets the CEO of his former Insurance company and try to steal his prized Michelangelo Maquette.* EPISODE 13: The Second David Job - After the events of the last job, the team has been fractured.  Will Nate be able to bring everyone together?VIDEO & AUDIO:Overall, ""LEVERAGE"" looks very good for a television drama.  Featured in Widescreen, a lot of scenes are done in the indoors and outdoors and you get many colorful scenes.  Like most drama series on DVD, it's when you get into low light situations and you do see artifacting.  But overall, for a drama series on DVD, ""LEVERAGE"" is stylishly cool in terms of visual appeal.As for audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital English 5.1 Surround and definitely utilizes the front channels for its explosions and rear surrounds take advantage of action sequences.  I discovered use of LFE as well and overall, for a drama series on DVD, ""LEVERAGE"" sounds great.  Dialog is easy to understand and more than enough action sequences on each episode.Personally, I really hope that Paramount considers a Blu-ray release of ""LEVERAGE"".  There are some really awesome visuals in this series and I can imagine how detailed and excellent this series would benefit from a High Definition transfer.  In fact, I hope Paramount considers it because this series is slick and I can imagine how awesome it would be on HD.  Overall, for a DVD release, audio and picture quality is slightly better than many series on DVD and the fact that there is three episodes instead of the typical four per DVD is a plus on the video end.SPECIAL FEATURES:""LEVERAGE"" features many special features as each disc has audio commentary for every episode which is magnificent.  The fourth disc is where the majority of the special features are located.  Included on the fourth disc are:* Leverage: Behind the Scenes - (12:40) Dean Devlin shows us behind-the-scenes of the making of ""LEVERAGE"".  Interviews with the talents and crew about their characters and the series.* Anatomy of a Stunt Fight - (3:23) How a stunt scene is rehearsed which includes a fight scene with Christian Kane's character Eliot and Christian discussing his fight scene and preparing for it.* The Cameras of Leverage - (2:14) A featurette primarily on the many cameras used for the filming ""LEVERAGE"".  I don't think I have ever seen a featurette focused on the cameras but film fans, especially those interested in the technical parts of filming will definitely enjoy this feature.* Leverage gets renewed - (2:52) Every talent and crew member gathers for a meeting with Dean Devlin and those who are not present are featured via webcam and placed between each seat of the actors.  Very fun featurette as everyone awaits the big news from TNT, TBS and Turner Classic Movies Executive Vice President Michael Wright.* Beth Riesgraf's Crazy Actress Spoof - (5:02) Beth Riesgraf vs. the Writers of Leverage.  An interesting spoof starring Beth Riesgraf (who plays Parker) who is a diva actress not so happy that her character has to deliver a zombie baby and taking out her anger at employees.  Very humorous and enjoyable!* Deleted Scenes - The series features two deleted scenes from ""The 12-Step Job"" (3:30) and ""The Second David Job"" (:31).JUDGMENT CALL:From the first episode, I was sold.  I absolutely enjoyed ""LEVERAGE"" and forget about ""Ocean's 11', this drama series features very cool characters, well-written, great locations for filming, witty, smart, stylish and overall, just cool!I was very impressed with the first season and each talent really brings their A game to the series.  Timothy Hutton plays a convincing role as the mastermind of the group; Gina Bellman brings that sexiness that she had in BBC's ""Coupling"" to the series but added depth as a true-to-art con artist; It's great to see Christian Kane again kicking butt since his years on ""Angel"" and also to see the two talents Beth Riesgraf and Aldis Hodge definitely shine in this series.  The characters are well, cast, well-planned, well integrated into the series and I really enjoyed the amount of character development we see in each episode.  Despite being thieves, they are all likeable in their own way.It's one thing to have the typical series special features but ""LEVERAGE"" really goes all out with commentary for each episode and also, the special features that are on this DVD are probably a first (a featurette about the series getting renewed and a featurette on the cameras used on the series) and were quite enjoyable.  Again, I really wish Paramount considers a Blu-ray release of this series.  With its slick production and overall action sequences, I would love to watch it on High Definition.I was pretty surprised to see the amount of technology used in the series but how slick the production is.  All characters are used effectively and each episode was just fun, smart and just enjoyable.  I was very impressed.Overall, this DVD release and the complete series is magnificent and is highly recommended!"
I love this show!  The writing and acting are fabulous.  I love being able to see Timothy Hutton every week.  Christian Kane is another great actor although I wish his character would cut his hair.  The other actors were new to me but they all had great chemistry.  Can't wait for Season Two to start!
"This is one of the best TV series to come out this decade!  The chemistry between the actors is great!  They become your friends...and there is nothing like having a hitter, hacker, grifter, thief and Nate-the-Great to come to your rescue!"
"I can not wait for the second season!! If you have not seen it and liked oceans 11,burn notice, etc then get it you will like it."
"I don't know why people are not raving about ""Leverage"" in the same breath they use on ""Weeds"" or ""The Wire,"" ""Mad Men,"" or other great cable TV series.  ""Leverage"" has a terrific (if incredible) premise, a wonderful cast, and among the best writing on TV.  It combines the fun of the classic Robert Wagner series ""It Takes a Thief"" with the witty dialog of ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer"" to create a perfectly entertaining and engaging confection.  This is television of the first rank, and this DVD set makes for extremely addictive viewing."
"Hog heaven, brother, is what I'm wallowing in. Loving con artist stories like I do, LEVERAGE: THE FIRST SEASON is like unwrapping a crazy awesome present. If you dig stuff likeThe Sting (Universal Legacy Series),Ocean's Eleven (Widescreen Edition), or evenPaper Moon, then LEVERAGE falls right in your wheelhouse. It's slick and smart and funny, and the key characters, initially cut from that predictable mold, quickly grow on you. TNT rolled out thirteen episodes of television goodness, except that by the first episode I'd already gotten hooked. Okay, ""The Miracle Job"" isn't any great shakes, but the rest of the episodes are very good. In fact, the standouts are ""The Nigerian Job,"" ""The Mile High Job,"" ""The Stork Job,"" ""The Juror #6 Job,"" and the two parter season closers ""The First David Job"" & ""The Second David Job.""I don't follow Timothy Hutton too much, but if a guy was ever meant to play a functioning alcoholic mastermind, it's Hutton. Nathan Ford (Hutton) is an ex-insurance investigator who parted ways with his insurance company when it refused to pay for his 8-year-old son's medical treatment. And Nathan's son died. So there's a grudge against corporate entities already set in place when Nathan is approached to lead a ""specialized"" team in a righteous heist. And that's how the not-quite-legal Leverage Consulting & Associates firm was born (providing ""leverage"" for the downtrodden).Thing is, Nathan Ford, all divorced and still grieving for his dead son and bleary eyed from the cups, is still a straight shooter, even though he's now orchestrating heists and stiffing soulless mega-corporations and underhanded governmental agencies who've effed with the helpless common Joes. And, while Nathan hasn't exactly reformed his tiny gang of thieves, hackers, muscle, and flim-flammers (all of whom had, before this, preferred to work solo), he's got them having so much fun doing bad for good causes that it's almost the same thing. I don't know if this is coming out of left field or not, but there's also this A-TEAM vibe permeating the thing, with Timothy Hutton's character just falling short of lighting a stogie and declaring that ""I love it when a plan comes together.""The show makes these characters interesting, and respective episodes do fill in some of the gaps in their backgrounds (although there's still a lot about their pasts that we're kept in the dark about). My favorite lawbreaker is Parker, the world's best thief and played with endless quirk, daredevil flair, and antisocial tendencies by Beth Riesgraf. Not to mention, she also provides a huge chunk of the funny. In ""The Mile High Job"" Parker's less than hostessy demeanor sets back stewardess/passenger relations for years. And in ""The Juror #6 Job"" I'll only mention that Parker attends jury duty (oh, and that she quiickly sniffs out a rat). Gina Bellman as grifter Sophie Devereaux also rocks it. I like that, when she's not hoodwinking her marks, Sophie sidelines as an actress, except that she's cringingly horrible at acting. But then put her in a scam, and she's flawless with her lines. She's simply hilarious in ""The Stork Job,"" in which the Leverage crew takes over a Belgrade movie set (the movie is ""Howl Force,"" about NATO troops being attacked by werewolves). Bellman and Riesgraf aren't your classic lookers, but there's no denying that Gina Bellman oozes sexy sophistication (and touts a range of convincing accents), and Beth Riesgraf smacks so much of crazy that I find her all kinds of attractive. (Huh. I may be a little disturbed myself.)The stings usually involve lots of hi-tech stuff, and so it's gratifying to have an episode in which Parker is unexpectedly asked to steal an item and she, on the fly, bypasses an impressive security system using nothing but what's available at hand (bit of make-up, aluminum foil, etc.).In thirteen episodes set to a jazzy cool musical score, the five-person team inflicts disguises, diversions, smooth con talk, double crosses, variations on classic scams and all around nasty trickeration on crooks big and small but all deserving. Part of the fun is when things don't go according to plan, and they end up having to improvise. The show indulges some in Fool-the-Audience and so part of the fun is also when the episode gets around to revealing what was really going on behind the scenes. And, to add even more flavoring, the show even introduces an element of romance here and there.If there's a running sub-plot in this season, it's Nathan's worsening alcoholism. This finally forces the crew to do an ""intervention,"" except that their notion of intervention isn't what you or I may come up with. This leads into the two-parter season finale, as the Leverage consulting firm tries to take down the insurance company which so messed up Nathan's life. And we also finally get to check out Nathan's hottie ex-wife. Also featured in the two-parter is recurring slimeball James Sterling, the chief investigator who'd taken over Nathan's position in that very same insurance company. In past episodes Sterling had gotten the better of Nathan. Methinks it's time for a getback.Four discs in this set, with not too shabby special features: pretty informative producer/director/writer audio commentary on each episode (although one wishes that the cast had also been allowed to provide commentary); deleted scenes on selected episodes; ""Leverage: Behind the Scenes"" (12:40 minutes); ""Anatomy of a Stunt Fight"" - Christian Kane (""Eliot"") breaks down a fight sequence from the episode ""The First David Job""; ""The Cameras of LEVERAGE"" - um, basically a 2-minute showcase for the different types of cameras used in filming the show (kinda pointless, unless you're a tech freak); ""LEVERAGE Gets Renewed"" - a cool brief segment in which Dean Devlin gathers his cast & crew (necessitating some video conferencing) for the 2nd season renewal announcement; and Beth Riesgraf's very weird Crazy Actress Spoof.The closing moments of the season finale attempts to throw some doubt as to whether these guys will stay together or go their separate ways. But no one was fooled. I mean, what beats getting payback for the little guy and being rewarded with an alternative revenue stream? The Leverage Consulting & Associates firm may be peopled with shifty characters, but they're shifty characters with pure hearts. More or less. Man, what a fun show!"
"A Theif, Hitter, Hacker, Grifter, and Mastermind all working together in a series which shows the good side of criminals. Stealing for the good of people that have been wronged. This series is a great choice for humor and danger, you might also learn a few things about running a successful con along the way."
"When I got my parents addicted this show after watching the first episode, they asked how they didn't know this show had been around since '08. Good question. Now that they know of it, they love it. And so does my brother. Oh, yeah... SO DID I! If anyone were to ask me what the show's about, three words suffice- cons conning cons.The main backstory of this show may upset parents who have lost an only child since the leader of this crackteam lost his only child to a hospital operation that wouldn't have worked. The leader knew a procedure that would work, yet his boss didn't go for it, despite the man's loyal work. So, to cope with his losses (child, wife, job, home, etc.), he becomes an alcoholic, and is offered his first job considering what he was when he had a job- an insurance investigator/stealing stolen artifacts. The job should be easy enough, with a gathered crack team of people that normally work alone (a brutal brawler, social actress, cat burglar, and computer hacker), they work together to steal something to bring it back to the owner, and get paid. Done deal. Oh, wait, things are never that simple. Teams gets back together again, and gets revenge. Idea- work together to bring down people who constantly gyp others who are trying to live decent lives and manipulate big-time cons with good social reputations to 'fess up their mess-up, and give people a reason to keep hoping for a better future. And what cons they go after.Manipulating an already-manipulated court session; giving a disabled vet the $ he needs stolen from him for rehab to work again; finding a kidnapped orphan to bring him back (and what a shocking twist that one had halfway through); helping a church keep a reputation and reveal the Judas in the social area; and revert an already botched bank robbery. Oh, don't worry, there's others, and all of them have wit, sarcasm, little moments that make them all the better, and, at times, very evocatively emotional scenes. Towards the end are some very heavy twists dealing with a few characters that dropped my jaw more than once.But it's the last con that did more than become icing on the cake. It was... how did the Klingons say it? Revenge is best served cold? Well, in Nathan Ford's case, the two part finale was a masterpiece all its own and rivaled the technique of so many heist movies that seem to try too hard. This had everything I love in a good drama. The enemies think they know how to outwit the thieves, only for a trip to get tripped and get tripped theirselves. So, I can see why they would leave the best far last. And I couldn't help but cheer with the cast in the special feature that reveals the show being renewed, or laugh with Beth in her own little spoof about her in-show character, or even laugh at the asininity of the deleted scenes. Now to get the 2nd season and continute the laughs and heartfelt emotion."
"With so many reality shows on TV, medical dramas and procedurals, I was happy to run across this wonderful show.  The cast is superb and acting is sublime.  The writers made sure the characters have their own past histories and flaws to work through and all of them appeared to grow in the first season (except Nate who seems to be getting worse.) There is no gratuitous sex or violence in this show and the writers keep things moving with witty dialogue and action.  Frankly, I have yet to guess how they are going to resolve each caper each week. My favorite episode is the pilot - The Nigerian Job.  If you have not seen the series, download the pilot. I promise you will be hooked.The Nigerian Job"
Great show loved it since day one. It's like mission impossible and the Italian job had a wild child and this is it but in a good way. The cast gels well together and I love how the cast feeds off each other the missions are good.
"The creators of this show really struck gold with a winning formula. It's a fine, strong ensemble cast. Hutton is very effective in the lead as the somewhat flawed, highly eccentric ""mastermind."" Aldis Hodge as Alec is always edgy and frequently hilarious. Beth Riesgraf as Parker brings equal amounts of sheer gorgeousness and sheer CRAZY to the role, but she is never ""over the top."" Put everyone together and you get a sense of balance where each cast member nicely complements and contrasts with the others, a true rarity in shows of this mind.The basic concept is also stronger than many of the ""expanded basic cable"" shows. Case in point, the Rob Morrow / Judd Hirsch vehicle ""Numbers,"" in which every single episode offers up an unsolvable, baffling crime which can only be solved when Morrow's idiot savant brother steps in and wraps everything up in a tidy little bow by concocting a mathematical formula. Movie of the week, amusing. Weekly TV show, tedious and predictable.The labels are accurate...""Robin Hood Meets Mission Impossible""...and yet, episode after episode the creators manage to come up with an entertaining premise and the cast pulls off with charm to spare.Read Amazon's description, read the reviews....if any of it sounds the least bit appealing to you, take a chance and order this set. You won;t be disappointed."
"Slick, fast paced, and so much fun you don't care how improbable it is. Casting is spot on with great chemistry between the actors. It's made TV worth watching again."
"Cons coning the bad guys is fun to watch.  This smart well written non stop action show with a great cast has it all, and with humor.  Beth Riesgraf, as Parker ('The Thief') is oh so funny with her very serious demeanor and dead pan delivery, especially in season one episode 6, The Mile High Job.  There is something in this series for everyone.  You can't go wrong here."
"I am a dinosaur when it comes to TV.  There are so few TV shows today that I like.  The format for today's shows bores me.I still use an antenna and had never seen this show. When it was syndicated a friend told me I had to watch it.  I was hooked immediately!  What a great show!  The writing is excellent, the cast is brilliant.  Whoever cast that show deserves an award!  Since I don't have cable I have not seen Season 5 yet and can't wait for it to come out on DVD."
I love these shows.  They are very entertaining.  I have all the seasons and enjoy them over and over again.
I just got this series and only watched the first episode and thought it was absolutely fabulous.  Every single character is well rounded and portrays their particular part with such great output.  I am very eager to watch the rest of the series.  I was more than impressed with the entire show.  The old saying is that you have to see it to believe it.  This is the case here.  You most definitely will believe it.
"...and I don't mean that in any bad way.  This is a quality I love about Leverage.I caught an episode on TV a while back (the one about horse racing) and was neither over nor underwhelmed.  I thought it was ok, but I had other shows to watch, and this wasn't going to fill the top spot by any means.  I thought I saw what they were trying to do, and appreciated it, but I questioned the execution somewhat.Yet it kept popping up on my radar, so I Netflixed S1, and wow, what an error in judgement.  The pilot is phenomenal, and since then, I can't really hate on any episode.  They are so well written, and so well acted, that each is like a mini-movie, which really exemplifies my theory about where entertainment is growing and expanding, on TV, not in the theater.As each episode fleshes out the cast more and more, as a viewer I had really strong buy-in in only a few episodes.  There's nothing on here that you couldnt let the whole family watch, yet there is a maturity about the show that is very subtle.  You dont have to see Christian Kane kill someone to know he CAN.  The whole cast has a mystery about them, and often nuances about the characters are revealed to surprise and appreciation.  As much as you know about the members of Leverage, Inc., you get the impression there is a whole world of things still left to learn.Its clear there is a large amount of homage being paid to the Ocean's movies, but Leverage also makes its own luck and S1 is really one of my favorite shows I've seen.  Its not always 100% believeable, but its always 100% entertaining."
There is no tv show that can rival Leverage. this is the greatest written crime drama that i have ever had the pleasure of watching...
The whole family likes watching the trials and tribulations and FUN that Mike Rowe goes through to bring us a laugh.
"I really love this series and those not familiar with it the title pretty much sums it up. The host of the show Mike Rowe (Mike is also the voice you hear on Deadliest Catch) is sent across America to spend a day working with people who have strange, dirty and little known to most people jobs. Mikes quick wit and chemistry with both crew and guests makes the whole show. It's a great watch!"
Its amazing that a first season of a show is so awesome. Just all around good wholesome fun show for the whole family.
This is the kind of reality TV we should have- real people doing the real things that make our world what it is. This show is great.
"Everyone complains about their job, but somehow the produces came up with a series that makes you hope someday they would put your dirty job on the show. Even if they never put your's on the air, it is well worth watching it, a good lesson to remind everyone of what real hard labor is. We forget what it is like to do these dirty but necessary jobs, my only regret is that they never had rich and famous people who never worked a day in their life or got their hands dirty to guest hosting the show. LoL"
"We love watching this show, Mike Rowe is funny, but you do learn a lot.  I watched him cleaning and repairing a refueling tanker with the Air Force, and last night I was watching the Air Force refueling a jet from the jet perspective, completed the circle.  Also never thought much about the things going down the sewers.  Just don't watch these shows while having dinner.  Some of those jobs are really Dirty Jobs."
This season 1 and all other seasons in this series is very educative to watch. You will find the host Mr. Mike Rowe&#8217;s comments very entertaining. Mike has gone to some extraordinary lengths to participate in these series and show us an array of episodes how hard some honest people work in this country to make our lives easier. If these honest people did not do their dirty jobs as portrayed in the series then civilized life on earth would not have been possible. Sincere thanks to all hardworking individuals who made these series a hit.
"Never watched this show on tv, but now I'm addicted. Mike is a very entertaining host and instructs us about the many difficult occupations that make our world work ... all of them dirty, very dirty ... lol."
"With the sharp wit of Mike Rowe, you can be assured that you will never be bored. Regardless of if he is cleaning a septic tank or collecting dead turkeys, there is always something different every episode."
Mike Row is funny and self deprecating.  What he puts himself through for an acting gig is completely disgusting and funny at the same time.
"Dirty Jobs indeed! The host of the show Mike Rowe (he's also the voice of Deadliest Catch) is sent across America to spend the day with people who have jobs that are dirty, different and relatively unknown to most of us. Mike has great chemistry with his crew and his quick wit with guests has you laughing through some stomach turning assignments."
A fun way to learn about difficult jobs. Mostly OK for kids and they warn you at the beginning of the episode when it is not.
"Mike Rowe is kind of corny, but it gives a fascinating look at jobs you just don't think about or want to.  We learn something from them in an entertaining way.  Some of the people just don't get paid enough!  I will miss it now that it is not on Prime.  We were only part way through the series."
This season 2 and all other seasons in this series is very educative to watch. You will find the host Mr. Mike Rowe&#8217;s comments very entertaining. Mike has gone to some extraordinary lengths to participate in these series and show us an array of episodes how hard some honest people work in this country to make our lives easier. If these honest people did not do their dirty jobs as portrayed in the series then civilized life on earth would not have been possible. Sincere thanks to all hardworking individuals who made these series a hit.
My wife and I have been watching this show together every night since we realized it was on Amazon Prime. It pretty much has made my subscription pay for itself. Mike is hilarious and the show is educational.
Ka-boom just about says it all. This is a series that has remained popular for something like 15 or 16 seasons. I don't know about anyone else but I come back for the ka-booms. I also enjoy the other things too because they do with attention to detail and wit.
"I enjoy all the episodes, all seasons. For this season, both the Pirate specials and Exploding Water Heater are worth repeated viewing."
"I love this series. It seems like they come up with ideas I would never have thought of researching. Most of all, I like how the enjoy what they are doing and are continually fascinated with their results. Also loved the pregnant Kari (though her taste in maternity wear was awful). It was great to show that pregnancy is just another way of life."
Husband and sons have watched many seasons and really enjoy them all.  We've all learned alot from the mythbusters.  Highly recommend.
"GREAT SHOW!!!  I USED TO WATCH THIS SHOW WHEN I HAD CABLE,BUT GOT TOO $$$$$$$$. SO WHEN I SAW IT OFFERED BY AMAZON PRIME(FREE) I JUMPED AT IT!!!!!!AWESOME SHOW"
These episodes were a treat. If you love exploring the deep and even more so the preditors that live there than this is for you. Educational
"I was at Lighthouse Beach in Chatham on Cape Cod watching this on my Kindle.  Chatham is known for all of the Great Whites that show up every summer because of the high seal population. I heard a college age guy behind me talking on the phone saying that he's scared to go in the water because of the shark sightings and will only go in ankle deep.  I watch an episode, then dive in & swim!  It adds to the fun of the ocean!"
"instead of thinking that Japanese message they intercepted was a trap to lure more naval personnel into the area, they should have tried to make contact with the USS Indianapolis and then if contact failed they should have immediately launched a search and rescue mission.secondly the ship was overdue, and still no contact was made by the navy with the USS Indianapolis, nor any search and rescue enacted.this was a case of many innocent sailors dying because the Navy did not care enough to follow through.too many navy personnel died while other navy personnel ignored their cries for help.what was never discussed was who from the navy who ignored the above,  and were they ever prosecuted and found guilty?too many unanswered questions which deserve answers now, and i hope we finally learn all the answers to the above concerns.too many navy personnel died while other navy personnel ignored their cries for help.lastly the naval officer they said was guilty of negligence, while all survivors said he did everything to keep them all alive and went above and beyond, but nevertheless the navy made him feel so guilty he ended up killing himself.......now that i call grave naval injustice, and a loss of the life of an exemplary naval officer, who went through hell on earth in the sea but still managed to keep many crewman alive to be rescued."
"I've loved Shark Week since it's inception, and through the years I've come to truly appreciate sharks of all types.  That being said, I don't put myself in THEIR environment anymore.  It's theirs, they 'own' it, they dominate it and I'm all good with that.  Still, I love learning about them, seeing them and watching the experts try to being understanding to we laymen.  That, I think, is what Shark Week is all about, although they do always bring the attacks to the fore, but that's because we, the viewers, are rubberneckers at heart and want to see blood in the water.I hope all will watch, learn and express their appreciation for the apex-predator of our seas."
The situation that this show presents are not typical and holds you attention.  The format of the stories are believable and the actors do a very good job.  I am looking for to watching the reat of the seasons.
This is an exciting and fun show. Not all the episodes aired in the United States  so it was fun to see the ones that only aired in Canada. I have both seasons of the show and cannot wait for the 3rd season to be released.
action packed and true to life and a great tribute to police officers anywhere.  Sorry it ended after so few seasons.
"This Canadian series holds onto its excellence in the release of season two. The name flashpoint refers to some event which brings a person to snapping and taking the law into his own hands.  That person is also about to do something awful, such as kill other people.  This squad has to do one of two things, either calm the person down until he surrenders to them OR kill the person before he can harm others. They are all excellent marksmen plus skilled in calming down people who have hit the flashpoint.  The series is set in Toronto."
"Awesome series, I loved it when it was on regular TV, and got moved to a different network. I have watched the entire 2nd season"
This one of the best programs I have ever seen.  It is family friendly with no swearing and no sex scenes.  It's extremely interesting seeing inside the SRU and seeing how they solve the cases.  I only wish it was more than 5 seasons.  Thank you Amazon Prime for offering this program. Would love to see more Canadian produced programs -- they seem to have it together better than the US.
Awesome show.  Season two continues to deliver everything that makes this show so great. I Highly recommend this show to Flashpoint lovers.
I have thoroughly enjoyed watching the Season 2 videos.  Too few episodes is my only complaint.  It is well written and well acted.
"I enjoyed season two.  Shocking end, but very well done.  I used to think only here in the USA that we had gangs, illegal guns, terrorists and good old fashion poverty, but this series is set in Toronto and shows human nature at its most vulnerable and that these human condition exist everywhere to one degree or another.The characters are very likable.  You see just enough of their private lives to be interesting and engage your interest without overwhelming the show.  Enrico Colantoni, is a spectacular actor and never disappoints no matter the role.  I have seen him in Veronica Mars, Just Shoot Me, and most recently in Person of Interest.  He is able to adapt to a role and make it believable.  Hugh Dillon is wonderful and David Paetkau is just plain HOT!  Where's the fan?  :)This is a police procedural with all the trimmings and well worth watching."
"We have become big fans of several BBC mysteries: Inspector Lewis at the top of the list. To this we have added the Canadian production, Flashpoint. The two shows are widely different but both thoroughly enjoyable. While Inspector Lewis is about solving impossibly complicated mysteries, Flashoint is about a Toronto police tactical unit, similar to swat teams here in the US. Every episode is extremely intense: filled with quick action and the high stress/emotion that goes along with it. You can't help but get caught up in it as you watch. That said, the show is not dark like many of the BBC mysteries, just really intense. The members of the cast each get to &#34;shine&#34; in different episodes so you get to know them well. One other really good thing: unlike the BBC mysteries where each season may be made up of only a few episodes, this series has as many as ten in a single season. All the more to enjoy!"
"As stated in my previous review of Season 1, Flashpoint is a Canadian-produced series about a SWAT-like paramilitary, police unit in Toronto.  Like the first season, it features terrific scripts and acting, likeable characters, great weaponry and action scenes.  I enjoy this show greatly.  (It started its 3rd season, 2 weeks ago, Friday nights on CBS)  There are a couple extras on the set concerning the weaponry of Flashpoint and one of its stars: Hugh Dillon.If you want to check out an exciting and highly enjoyable and suspensful action series, you should check out Flashpoint.  If you have not seen season one or two, you should definately pick us these sets."
awesome.  sexy men and smart tough good looking woman.  story line fast and intelligent .  different locales all of the time i like.  music good.  keep em coming.
"I enjoyed watching Mark Taylor on Flashpoint. I was sad when his character Lewis was killed in the 3rd Season, Episode 1: One Wrong Move."
I'm mesmerized by this series---just can't get enough of it.The characters are what make it----they are so believable!Great job!!
"This is the best show on television, tied with NCIS. I love the characters and their humaness. There is plenty of action but these characters also have a soft side and I appreciate seeing that. I truly love this show."
each episode in the series makes you want to see more. the cast and the entire show are well-worth watching.
Each episode is a story that is very true in today's world of growing violence and many times dealing with mentally ill criminals or mentally ill persons who have been hurt due to the results of violent crime. I love the show. There is great humanity among this featured special police unit.
"AWESOME SHOW FULL OF DRAMA, HEARTFELT CLOSENESS BETWEEN THE TEAM SO AT TIMES IS A TEAR JERKER BUT THEN I AM A LADY, HAVE WATCHED ALL THE SEASONS, RECOMMENED YOU DO ALSO, IN ORDER. SAD TO SEE IT GO OFF THE AIR."
Really like this show. It as the same kind of draw you in feel as other shows like the original CSI. You kinda get to know the characters and grow with them.
"... my friend, this is. An almighty business man, accustomed to being sought after for his money or used by competitors, falls in love with a female artist hired to make a fresco for the foyer of his building. Being cautious he sets his spies on her, planting microphones and cameras in her rooms and workrooms, only to be embarrassed when he finds himself in an amorous situation with her, and does not want to be recorded. All the roles are well-played especially by Bonmaire. I think I loved it."
I'm always on the lookout for interesting romantic comedies and this movie turned out to fit the bill. Great acting and passionate love scenes made this one better than expected.
My husband and I continued to enjoy this series.  The husband (coach) and wife (school principal/counselor) played strong role models for the many teenagers as they all struggled through various real-life situations.  The only disappointing aspect of the series was the on-going sexual encounters that began during the middle school years of various students.
"I love this show so much that I'm sad season 3 is over. It's amazing how every episode is funny, heartfelt and sad!! Every emotion every show.Hope season 4 can live up to the exceptionally high standards I've placed on it"
"This is a no spoilers review.  Anyone who is planning on watching this in the winter NBC schedule will not want warnings about what is going to happen.  Those of us who have caught it on DirecTV were delighted and stunned.  I'm going to try to be fairly nonspecific and most of the plot details that I discuss will occur in the first episode, so not much will be revealed.  The review does assume that you've seen Seasons One and Two.  If you have not seen those, this review will contain some spoilers.Season Two of FNL was great, especially the second half of the season, but all in all it was hurt for two reasons.  First, there was the rather melodramatic killing of Tyra's stalker by Landry Clarke.  Pretty close to universally fans objected to this, though most also enjoyed the time that Tyra and Landry were forced to spend together as a result.  Second, the series was hurt by the writer's strike, with the series ending uneasily with Smash being unable to play football for several games.  Other fans complained of Lyla's sojourn as a born again Christian and how whiney Julie was in the first half of the season.  Along the way, however, there has been a host of marvelous storylines.  I gave Season Two five stars without any hesitation, though I also was the first to admit that it wasn't the work of perfection that Season One was.Frankly, based on pure business considerations, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS should have been cancelled at the end of Season Two.  The ratings were just miserable.  And despite every TV critic in America just going crazy over the show (I honestly prefer it to THE WIRE and THE SHIELD), it curiously has not garnered any awards attention.  How is it possible that Connie Britton has not won a couple of Emmys for Best Actress (no one can seriously tell me that Sally Field has been a better television actress than Britton over the past two years)?  Why no awards for Kyle Chandler?  Why has Adrianne Palicki's astonishing work as Tyra Collette gone unrecognized by the awards?  Omissions like this are an indictment of the awards themselves.  And why has FNL not received two straight nominations for Best Drama?  It is simply absurd that it has not.Miraculously, NBC did something uncharacteristic for a major network:  it found a way to save a show that deserved saving.  They worked a deal with DirecTV to show the 13 episodes of Season 3 in the fall of 2008 with NBC showing the show in the winter of 2009.  Kudos to NBC!  I have been horrified by some recent decisions by the majors.  How ABC could even have considered canceling a masterpiece like PUSHING DASIES, let alone doing it, is simply inconceivable.  And how NBC, despite the very good thing it did in saving FNL, imagines that it is doing quality TV a service by gutting five hours of scripted TV next year so that we can get stuck with the repellant Jay Leno is unimaginable.  Still, I wish more networks would take the effort that NBC did to save their best shows.Right now there is no word on whether there will be a Season Four of FNL.  My assumption is that after some of the ratings for the winter come in, NBC and DirecTV will sit down and figure out whether they want to do this again.  If they do, the format is difficult to predict.  There are a few major changes on the show, but within specifying what those are, there will clearly need to be a decision as to whether to stick with the kids who have graduated from Dillon High or keep Coach Taylor in high school football with a new group of players.  Personally, I've been hoping that the main kids go to the same college, where Taylor will be named the new head football coach.  But if there is no Season Four, they have left Season Three in a place to where it can serve as a series finale.  The final two episodes are brilliant summations of everything wonderful that we've cared about for three years.Season Three is, in my opinion, the best yet.  Nearly ever major character has some wonderful story arcs.  Because of budgetary considerations and also perhaps the pressure of giving all the characters enough time with only 13 episodes, two major characters has to be written out of the show, though each one gets a several-episode arc to say goodbye.  Those two are Smash Williams and Jason Street.  Given that both have graduated from Dillon, this was a logical change.  Also apparently for reasons of time and budget Santiago, who in Season Two was living with Buddy Garrity, simply disappears with no comment.  But the other familiar are back.  Season Two ended with Tim Riggins ardently pursuing Lyla Garrity, Tyra and Landry dating as an official couple, and Julie pining for Matt.  All those relationships get shaken up (though I won't say in what ways).  But nothing is so completely shaken up as Coach Taylor's involvement with the new school principal.  And nothing is so funny as the new principal coming to terms with two simple words, ""Jumbo Tron.""I especially enjoyed Tyra's arc in Season Three.  If you rewatch Season One of FNL, it is clear that early on they didn't quite know what to do with Tyra.  Adrianne Palicki, who plays Tyra, is an amazing beauty with incredible onscreen charisma, but for the first three-quarters of Season One she is just in the show simply because she is.  She is not integrated into any of the show's major storylines.  But once Tami Taylor takes an interest in her (fascinatingly, just shortly after she had forbade her daughter to be friends with her), we get one of the best stories of an individual coming to desire a better life and doing something to achieve it that I've ever seen on TV.  And I'll slightly break my promise not to reveal any spoilers by stating that one of the entire highlights in all of FNL comes in the next to last episode where Tyra reads aloud her college application essay.  It is as moving a moment as you'll encounter on television and it also marks just how far Tyra's character has come since Season One.  And along with Tyra you get her endlessly fascinating relationship with Landry Clarke.  If you don't like their relationship one week, check back the next.  The tension between his never ceasing adoration of her and her flittering back and forth between valuing him for all his outstanding qualities and her reign as the queen of mixed signals produces many of the show's best moments.  And any conversation that the two actors have is special.This is a season filled with surprises, a plethora of marvelous small moments, a few heartbreaks, and a few shocks.  I've gotten about eight or nine people to watch this show and every one of them has become a passionate lover of it.  If you already love the show, you'll love this great, great and hopefully not final season as much as the first two."
I loved this show so much I couldn't wait to finish it.  I devoured each season and when I got to the end.  I watched Season 1 all over again because by that time I was in love with each and every character.
"Each episode had its own challenges, just like real life.  The encouragement and mentors hip of 'Coach and Mrs. Taylor spoke to many young people who need it in real life.  Cast was amazing. Hated to see it end."
"I am not a football fan by any means, but this show is entertaining on all levels. Drama, comedy and tragedy. Even the music is excellent. I just downloaded the 2 compilation CDs. There is something for everyone in this show. Enjoy."
I simply cannot say enough good things about this program.  Exciting.  Riveting.  Great characters and an interesting plot with each episode.  One of my all time favorites.
"It is amazing to see the writers and producers of this show maintain such high quality with great stories and endless conflicts.  The group has many more personal problems to deal with now, not so much football, like Tyra and her academic struggles, the Riggins brothers and their attempts at making money along with Jason Street, who now has a baby to care for, Matt and his neverending issues with his grandma, Julie and her frequent clashes with her parents, and more."
"Continues to be impressively well-written and acted, appealing characters, stories which fully engage viewers in each episode. A wonderful series."
"An interesting drama about an imperfect love triangle. Joaquin Phoenix plays Leonard, a man perhaps in his early thirties, living in an apartment in Brooklyn with his parents, a Jewish couple who have a small dry cleaning operation where Leonard works. Leonard has a story behind him: an engagement with a girl was broken some years ago when they found that they were genetically incompatible, and he has tried to kill himself in the past, more than once. His parents, worried by him, try to set him up with Sandra, the nice daughter of a fellow (and apparently wealthier) Jewish businessman. Though not terribly enthusiastic about Sandra, he starts going out with her, who is very attracted to him (why a seemingly down to earth person like Sandra would be attracted to an obviously troubled person like Leonard is unclear, though I suppose things like this happen, though not very usually, in real life). But just when Leonard and Sandra start meeting and knowing each other, he meets Michelle (Gwyneth Paltrow, who is great), an impetuous, beautiful, but messed-up neighbor. Leonard falls for Michelle quickly, but soon realizes that she sees him basically as an asexual friend, and feels no sexual attraction whatsoever for him. In fact, Michelle has a relationship with a married man, and wants Leonard to go out with them in order to see if he would be willing to leave his family to her. A normal guy would realize there is no hope with her and tell her goodbye at this point, but Leonard is too smitten with Michelle to do so. And so, while his relationship with Sandra starts growing, so does his obsession with Michelle (who, while not really loving him, is constantly calling him for help). At the end, Leonard would have to make a choice between living with the nice Sandra, who loves him but is somewhat boring, and the unstable Michelle, who is gorgeous and fun to be with, but also very unstable, and if that wasn't enough, really doesn't love him, and would probably leave him soon if she would even agree to be with him. Not an awful dilemma for a well grounded person. One could argue with the resolution, assuming that Michelle is telling Leonard the truth (WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD): men almost never leave their wives for their lovers, and especially unstable and emotionally immature women like Michelle. Still, these points aside, this is a solid, well-acted movie, which is never boring, and rings truthful most of the time."
"Having been in nearly the same situation more than once, I identified with the Phoenix character, though not with his bipolar problem. He falls for two women at once, but for different reasons. One seems like his backup plan in case the one he really wants, Paltrow, falls through, which she does at every opportunity because she is almost as unstable as him. In the end, the Plan B comes into play. Along the way, Phoenix delivers some realistic emotions, as do the two female leads. This is a very contemporary film, fraught with real adult desires and frustrations when we search for love and don't always find it perfectly."
"update February 2010: Phoenix was just photographed clean shaven and no longer doing his rap act.  I hope this means he is about to return to film!original review:Joaquin Phoenix bizarrely made the rounds after this film, looking like a grizzly bear and stating that he was leaving movies so that he could be a rapper.  Cut to him performing as a rapper--he was atrocious!  Some say that this is a joke he is playing for a film his brother-in-law Casey Affleck is making.  I sure hope so.  Because the truth of the matter is that Phoenix is one hell of an actor.  After all, Paltrow is no slouch.  She has an Oscar on her mantle.  But he steals the thunder from everyone in this film.  He dominates it from the first scene and never lets go.He plays the Jewish son of a mom and pop business operation which has another mom and pop as a partner.  His parents and the partner start pushing this young woman for him as a highly desirable wife.  In all good conscience, in the movie at least, she comes across as better looking, with a better personality and in short, with a lot going for her.  He actually seems lucky to have come up with someone  this good.  He plays his guy as no charismatic ball of fire. He plays him as an ok guy but no one you'd be dying to date much less marry. (Phoenix has played the opposite with equal effectiveness, exuding charisma and sexuality, again showing how good his acting chops really are).Now here come the wrench.  Gwenyth Paltrow appears and she is clearly above his touch.  She is involved with an older, married professor. She is also a complete flake.  You just know, if you aren't someone who is smitten with her, that she is nothing but trouble.  She vacillates constantly over what she wants and flits around from interest to interest.  I doubt you'd want her as a friend. So, of course, Phoenix falls for her like the proverbial ton of bricks.To say anymore would ruin the plot.  I thought it was a terrific film with an unusual plot line.  It was focused, tight, well scripted and brilliantly acted.I hope no one buys a single rap record he makes!"
"This film has a lot going for it. Three absolutely gorgeous women, Gwyneth Paltrow, Vinessa Shaw, and Isabella Rossellini. A quirky lead male, Joaquin Phoenix (yes the same one that had the idiotic much parodied interview with David Letterman). A complex love story, but one that seems more honest and true than the silly happy stories usually told. Interesting camera work and lighting - filmed in muted tones. And excellent direction and writing by James Gray.The film opens with Leonard (Joaquin Phoenix) jumping off a low bridge. As he floats downward, he sees an image in his mind and decides to live. There is something not exactly 100% with Leonard. He lives at home, there are cryptic questions about where he was four months ago, and he moves and talks in a halting not altogether there mode. The love triangle is a bit different. Sandra (Vinessa Shaw) likes Leonard. She's single, saw Leonard at his father's dry cleaner, and decided to set up a pretext to meet him. Leonard isn't 100% interested, but there's something going on. One afternoon, coming home, Leonard runs into Michelle (Paltrow) in the hallway running away from her yelling father. From the first meeting, its clear Leonard is interested. As the story progresses, we discover that Michelle is in love with and having an affair with a married man. She in turn feels like Leonard is her brother. This is the central conflict of the film, who will end up with who? Will anyone end up happy or get what they want?Its this conflict and resolution that James Gray has developed oh so well. In the end, it is a sad movie. And each character gets what they want, even if it might not be in their best interest. The path there is an interesting one.Oh the performances. Paltrow, Shaw, Phoenix, and Rossellini carry this film. There is a chemistry between these actors. It is clear that the director found exactly what each needed to deliver their best performances. Isabella Rossellini is such a surprise, a simple housewife, but so beautiful and all knowing. Its telling to see the star, writer, and director of,Green Porno: A Book and Short Films by Isabella Rossellini.Early in the film we see Michelle first in bright sunlight in the hallway and Leonard bent over in shadow in front of his doorway. Michelle early on is always seen in a powerful dynamic composition with bright background and Leonard in a darker cluttered shot. As the story progresses and Michelle begins to show her flaws, she moves more toward the middle of the screen, the background becomes more cluttered, and she ends up in shadow or dim lighting. Leonard, on the other hand moves toward more dynamic brighter shots. Sandra and Leonard are almost always treated to similar lighting and composition. James Gray used film language to reinforce his story. It is so rare to see in a film anymore.110 Minutes long, pacing is right on the money. Rated R, mostly for strong language. There are two intimate scenes with no nudity. Michelle does expose one breast through a window while Leonard watches across the courtyard from his window. A mature younger viewer could probably watch this film.The DVD has some nice bonus features. A series of deleted scenes where the director writes about why he left the scene out. The reasons are valid, and the sequences really did not belong in the film. There are two very well done interview featurettes. One with James Gray talking about casting and the love that he put into this film. The other is HDNet's review of the film.A very well made film. I enjoyed this very much."
"James Gray is one of the more interesting directors to appear on the film scene during the past few years.  His gritty style is reminiscent of Sidney Lumet's, which is a an easy comparison since Gray's first three movies were crime dramas, set in blue collar areas of New York and surrounding areas.  Like Lumet, Gray makes his downtrodden locations a ""character"" in his movies.Gray uses this same dusky style for TWO LOVERS, which is not a crime movie, but a romantic drama.Gray regular Joaquin Phoenix stars as a troubled young Jewish man, drifting through life, living with his parents.  Within a couple days, he meets two women.  One of them is the nice daughter (Vinessa Shaw) of the man who wants to merge his chain of dry cleaning establishments with Joaquin's father's one man store.  After a brief romantic encounter, Joaquin and Vinessa become ""boyfriend/girlfriend"".The other woman is a neighbor (Gwyneth Paltrow), and she is really screwed up,  In fact, she is being ""kept"" by a wealthy married man who doesn't seem to want to leave his wife, despite his promises.Guess which one Joaquin loses his heart to.TWO LOVERS is the best picture that I've seen thus far this year.  It has an intelligent, well-crafted script by Gray and Richard Menello, good direction and fine performances.Isabella Rossellini and Elias Koteas co-star. Michael B. Druxman"
"This movie transcends relationship cliches and has the bravery to stay focused on it's 3 characters without any trite or whimsical artificial plot twists.  This guy is in a rut and assumes the erratic romance which is more difficult to attain must be valuable. Conversely, the calm stable romance he doesn't quite trust.  All 3 characters are headed for some challenges regardless of their choices."
"Like Holmes, House is my favorite mystery solver. The show was a hit with me. I will miss watching it."
"Up to season 5 House was known as focusing a lot on the comical witticisms of House as he insulted his colleagues and his boss. This particular season takes a more serious turn, and although there does exist the comedy that it's famous for, there is a more serious aura around the entire season and its characters as all is not well in the land of Dr. Gregory House. For a medical drama, House is pretty special as it retains a very formulaic style of storytelling and wholly stays away from soap opera dramatics; instead replacing them with casual love stories, complex medical cases and an even more complex main star.Just when we think we know House, the show takes another massive turn and shows us a completely different side to him that we never thought existed. Season 5 seeks on exposing a new emotional side to House. At the end of season 4 we saw the end to Wilsons girlfriend, Amber and what we are lead to believe to be the friendship of House and Wilson. Season 5 opens with our worst fears, Wilson quits and tells House that they can no longer be friends and in order for Wilson to be truly happy, he must have House out of his life.In comes a private investigator hired by House to spy on Wilson in his new life and also his team. The split doesn't last for long and House & Wilson end up back to their old tricks of childish friendship antics. Chase & Cameron gain a more prominent role in this season as their relationship is explored in more detail as Cameron struggles with the possibility of a permanent relationship as she still can't let go of the memories of her husband who died a few years prior to their relationship. This presents a higher purpose for them still remaining in the opening title sequence and hopefully, this increased prominence will mean they become a stronger part of the team in season 6.Thirteen is also forced to struggle with the fact that she has Huntington's disease, and to a certain point takes it very badly. Foreman also gains a bit more purpose in this season and develops a relationship with Thirteen, but I felt like this relationship was only brought into the picture to avoid having to fire him as even now his presence just seems pointless. Taub and Kutner are their usual selves with nothing really important happening to them other than House torturing Taub over his affair. There are quite a few delightful surprises that take place during the season, some are more important than others, but they're all designed to keep us watching to the next episode.As with every TV show, the finale is always the most special episode that will keep you wanting more up to when the next season starts. House is no exception to that rule and although most TV shows may create a cliff-hanger to keep you wanting more, they would also wrap a few stories up so they don't have to be revisited. House very rarely does that. Instead it gives us riveting cliff-hangers that makes us question the true brilliance of what we have seen, yet if you're not a fan of the primary cliff-hanger, there's also a few other stories that you will want to know what happened next. This is a truly brilliant season that exposes a more emotional and loveable side to House that have only briefly been explored in previous seasons. There is one massive shocker that most reading this review will have probably heard about by now, but it's just an overall great season and worthy of any House fans DVD collection."
"Far from going downhill, I think HOUSE made some difficult choices in its melange of characters and those choices were correct to make.  First and foremost, Cameron and Chase were weak characters played by weak actors.  They have been all but completely pushed off the show and they should be.  They have been replaced by much stronger actors, especially the incredibly strong actors Peter Jacobson and Kal Penn as supporting doctors. The already strong characters (played by strong actors) of Foreman, Cuddy and Wilson remain, with bolder roles than ever.  Of course, they are all dominated and eclipsed by Hugh Laurie as HOUSE himself.  For anyone who has been living in a cave without a tv for the last 5 years, HOUSE is a series tv show about one of the top internists in the world who correctly diagnoses just about every freak medical condition which exists.  He is played by British actor Hugh Laurie who is incredibly convincing as an American.  I watched Hugh Laurie on British tv in his earlier shows, especially with Stephen Fry, and HOUSE is as opposite a role from those as one could imagine. HOUSE functions like the modern day incarnation of Arthur Conan Doyle's twin inspirations, his medical mentor and professor, Dr. Joseph Bell, also a premier diagnostician, plus his literary creation, detective Sherlock Holmes. HOUSE has all the same off putting social characteristics as Holmes plus he is likewise musical and a drug addict (pain killers).  Wilson, the oncologist in the same hospital, is as close to a Watson as HOUSE can find.  He is the only one who long term puts up with HOUSE as a friend.  There are lots of surprises in this season which I cannot mention because they would be terrible spoilers.  I will say the ending this time is the very best one the show has ever done and is totally fitting for the way the character HOUSE has been developed.  I am waiting eagerly for season 6."
"Hugh Laurie is incredibly talented as an actor, musician and singer. The other cast members are equally talented and it's quite interesting to observe their interactions while surrounded by humor, angst, drama and intelligent writing. Bravo!"
Loved this show. I hate that it was cancelled. I like the shows theme and the smart people. All the members are smart. I love it. No stupid-b----e style.
I find this show entertaining but at the same time offers it some very interesting ideas regarding identifying people who are lying.  Very seldom does a TV show make me do research into a topic but this one does.
Watching it on Amazon Prime is even better because you don't have to wait for next week or next season to see the next episode.
Always twisting plots and am no on Season 3 and wish there were more in the can so that I could watch all of them....................
I wish this show hadn't gotten dropped because its an awesome and smart show. Apparently this is based on a real guy who wrote a book about being able to recognize whether people are lying by their facial expressions and body language and there is a website to check out as well. I like movies and shows based on something real. Excellently executed and the actor they got to play the main character is brilliant.
I LOVE THE SHOW!!!! The characters are well-developed and the premise of the show is a refreshingly new look at crime shows.
I have always loved Tim Roth and think he does a great job in this series.  This is such an extraordinary topic!  I don't know if there is scientific evidence to back up the theory around which the show revolves but suspect there is.  I will be looking into it a bit deeper.  I just don't understand why it only ran 3 seasons. I guess mainstream America didn't get it but I love it!!
"This show is great. Plain and simple. A private consulting firm that specializes in deception training and recognizing people's ""tells"" is a great twist in the crime drama genre. I am also a big fan of Tim Roth, I think he's a great actor and he does an incredible job in this show. There are great characters, creative plots, and just all around great watching.There is underlying drama going on in the various characters' lives, which they touch on in each episode but they don't get too in-depth with. It's almost like giving a starving dog a small treat, just enough to make you want to watch the entire next episode to see if they reveal any more. This is 5 stars without hesitation. If you like crime dramas but are looking for something a little different, give this a go."
"Interesting concept- worth researching the background on the concept.  There actually is a bit of research and practice on decoding expressions.  Plus of course every souse believes they can tell when someone is lying don't they?  Fun to watch and each story has a beginning and a solution which is nice, not a soap opera format."
From this show I am learning how to read micro expressions this is a very interesting study and like many others I am choosing to learn threw watching tv rather than reading.
New subject matter leaving some new series in the dust.  Interesting concept but sure someone can master it.  Worth your time.
"This show is so awesome because there hasn't been anything like it before!  It is, in a way, a crime show/solver, but different than ones you have seen.  Very interesting way of solving crimes by being able to tell if people are lying or not.  Love it!"
"This is quite a different show from the &#34;norm&#34;. It definitely keeps us interested. We originally rented it from the Library, but decided to go ahead and buy this & the following 2 seasons."
Very interestng show.  Each episode is another story and they are all really good.Don't know if body language really tells whether or not you are lying but it sure makes it interesting!
"This program escaped me when it was originally aired, however I am thoroughly enjoying watching it now.  The twists and turns of the stories are interest catching and I find myself looking at others to see &#34;if they are telling the truth&#34;.  Great program!!"
"I'll tell you, I sure wouldn't want the main character in this show to interview ME. He'd see every little quirk and foible and end up reading me like a book. That, of course, is why he makes such a great &#34;detective.&#34;  Almost nobody can get past him. Tim Roth is brilliant and so are the scripts. Too bad it lasted only 3 seasons. But that's like 50 episodes of terrific mystery-suspense. If you haven't checked it out, get on the ball and do so."
Lie to Me: Season One Dvds. Good Delivery Time. Great Drama series.My husband wanted to see this after seeing two of the shows and we loved it!Amazon had great low prices and DVD in Perfect condition!
"Five stars because it never disappoints. It is not a masterpiece classic nor a high dollar period piece, but it consistently provides good entertainment and story lines. We watch it during dinner time and it provides great entertainment for this purpose."
I love this series even thought Mr Lightman is an unusual man. It has a mild sense of humor. I enjoy how the truth is uncovered with their skills of face reading. I would definitely recommend this series.
"Great story line, really interesting, especially comparing real life expressions to actors' expressions.Tim Roth as always gives a great performance."
"This show is interesting because it is based something we all do, interpret the mood of friends and coworkers.  We do it before we say to a friend, &#34;Boy, you got out of the wrong side of the bed this morning!&#34;  Clinical psychologists do it as they are aware of the changes fear and elation cause in the body.  High level KGB agents, such as Putin, are trained to be especially skilled in the technique of emotional prying.  Many a fortune teller is a skilled emotional reader who amazes a client with what the client is telling in body and facial language.  The lead actor in this series is miscast but the concept and story line is well done."
Love this show~~  I'm sorry to note that there only seems to be 3 seasons.  Makes me curious as to why it wasn't continued.
"Lie To Me is unique in that the science in the episodes is proven and real. The stories may be fictitious, but each episode is riveting and will have you stunned and on the edge of your seat. Everyone, male and female I have introduced to Lie To Me was an addict by the end of the first episode. I hate that it was cut after 3 seasons. Excellent actors, and has everything you could want from entertainment.... drama, comedy, suspense, you name it! I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for something new to enjoy."
This show is great: wonderful cast and tight scripts and a really intriguing premise.  Each show stands on its own but also arcs the characters over the full season.  Well worth watching.
"Tim Roth stars as Dr. Cal Lightman, a no-nonsense expert in lie detection who heads The Lightman Group, a Washington D.C.-based team of likeminded professionals who help solve crimes and mysteries by analyzing the facial expressions and behavior of the various individuals involved.Lightman and his partner, Dr. Gillian Foster (Kelli Williams) are primarily assisted by their young protegees, researcher Eli Loker (Brendan Hines) and Ria Torres (Monica Raymund), a newcomer who was specially chosen for her innate ability to spot lies without any prior training.Of course, a negative aspect of being so finely tuned to the nuances of human behavior means seeing things in family and friends, even when you might not always want to -- as Lightman has learned the hard way with his ex-wife Zoe (Jennifer Beals). He and Foster have an often-repeated agreement not to ""cross the line"" when dealing with one another. Yet when you genuinely care about someone, and interact regularly, it's often difficult to keep your eyes closed and mouth shut.Particularly memorable episodes include ""Depraved Heart,"" where Cal investigates the back-to-back suicides of two Indian sisters -- and reveals something startling about the reason he first got into lie detection -- and ""Blinded,"" where the group tries to find out who's copycatting a serial rapist's brutal assaults before the next woman is assault -- and one of their own is threatened.This drama provides a great blend of workplace mysteries and personal issues, as well as a number of red herrings (Lightman himself being the master). If you haven't given this show a try, please do -- you'll soon be hooked!"
I am hooked not only on this series but on the technology. I will never look at some ones' face the same way again. Looking down is a sign of lying while looking down and to the side is shame. I would love to learn more about the art/science of mini expressions. The acting in this series is superb and the casting perfect. A must watch.
"Wow, unexpectedly great show--I'd give it 10 stars if I could. Dr. Lightman (Tim Roth) doesn't just read facial cues to tell when folks are lying--he's pretty darn good at telling lies himself. This show is fresh, original, and addictive. I never would have thought the show would work with Tim Roth in the lead but he's terrific as are the other 2 main characters--you want to know what's going to happen to these people. And unlike another reviewer I liked how season 1 ended. These folks who study the science of lying have a gift, and that gift is both a blessing & a curse as you will see thru the first 13 episodes. Can't wait for season 2."
"We were a little behind obviously, but very glad we found it on Amazon Prime.  Very interesting topics and you find yourself guessing if a person is lying now."
"I love watching this TV Show! Tim Roth, who is the owner of the Lightman Company, has a great British accent and he plays a very intelligent scientist who uses his talents and skills in science and psychology to help law enforcement catch both blue collar and white collar criminals. All in all, it's a great show."
I think the acting is brilliant....and the characters they play are interesting. This is more of a phsycological detective show which never shows graphic viiolence...it leaves a lot for the imagination and keeps you wondering. I think the Sherlock series was better but this one comes close...
I love this show!!! My husband is ex cop and has taught me a lot about &#34;reading&#34; people and I love how the character in the show calls people out on their deception.
"AN INTERESTING NEW IDEA IN SOLVING CRIMES OF ALL SORTS. IF YOU LIKE HOUSE, YOU SHOLD LIKE THIS. ATTITUDE EVERYWHERE."
"We Love the  show!  The characters are likeable, easily able to connect with, good interation with each other.  The storylines are always good, we really enjoy this show."
"that the story is based on a real person, makes this show very interesting. I am not sure how anyone can develop such a talent, but it sure makes this show quite entertaining to watch."
Fantastic show. I love it and can't wait to watch the other seasons. Studying minute facial expressions to acknowledge lying is amazing.
Loved it from the first episode and could not wait for the DVD to be released so I could watch the episodes over and over.  It is just that good.  I am hanging out for more as the first Season only had thirteen episodes.  I believe it has now been definitely picked up and therefore can look forward to many more.  Do yourself a favour and watch it you will not be disappointed.
"I was not attracted to watch this at first, then I read the description. AND I found out Tim Roth was the star! I really have liked his acting talent! All are good however (the actors) I love the plots, they surprise me and they are all unique. Keep the series coming!!!!"
I didn't watch the original TV program on Fox so I enjoyed watching the episodes on my Kindle. This is a well written and well acted drama. Facial and voice cues are used to determine if someone is lying. Cases involve a variety of situations so it is not repetitive. The mix of work and family in the show is enjoyable to watch. I would recommend Lie to Me to anyone who likes crime dramas. I realize that Fox cancelled Lie to Me due to low ratings. I don't remember seeing ads for the show so I wonder if they promoted it well enough.
"I can't emphasize enough the benefit of DVD when it comes to television shows. This is not to discount the shows themselves when they air since with no one viewing they soon get canceled. But with the advent of TV programs on DVD we have the chance to see the first season of a show with enough time to fall in love with it, drawing us to season two and beyond. When studios realize this then perhaps more deserving TV shows will remain on the air longer than a single season.That being said I've discovered another great show that I missed when it originally aired. LIE TO ME was on the Fox Network this past year and while I think Tim Roth is a great actor, for one reason or not I always missed the show, usually to something else being on at the same time (another great fault of network TV). Now that I've seen season one, I'll make a point of being there for the next season.LIE TO ME is based on fact but not one person or story in particular. The series revolves around Cal Lightman (Tim Roth) who head up The Lightman Group. What Cal has done is researched the human features and movements to discover that it is inherent in every living being to show their emotions in facial and body movements to display whether they are lying or not. From culture to culture, these ticks and twitches are the same. And using that information, Cal and his team can spot if someone is lying or not by just watching them.Having worked in the past for the Department of Defense, Cal has gone private and his firm is doing tremendous business. When someone needs to know if a person is lying, call in the Lightman Group. And we're not talking simple cases of spousal infidelity here; we're talking major players like murder suspects and terrorists.Aiding Cal each week is the main team the show focuses on led by partner Dr. Gillian Foster (Kelli Williams). A psychologist by profession, Gillian has studied the information Lightman has provided, mingling with her own studies, and is at good at detecting a lie as Lightman is. To go up against one may result in questions, but when both take a look into a case the truth comes out.Studying with Lightman on his team is Eli Loker (Brendan Hines) who has decided to stop lying altogether. This results in some humorous and uncomfortable situations where his speaking the truth is either not welcome or results in admissions he might not normally make...such as his answer to if he is good in bed or not.New to the team is Ria Torres (Monica Raymund), a natural. Unlike Lightman who developed his abilities through years of studies, Ria can naturally detect when someone is lying or not. There are few with these abilities and Ria is one of them. Lightman's desire for Ria is to help her along, to teach her the science behind her abilities which in turn will only increase them.With the characters in place, the show focuses each week on a different scenario where their abilities and qualifications come into play to help someone out. At the same time, each has a personal problem that becomes part of the show as well be it children, cheating spouse, insecurities or more.There isn't an episode on this collection of season one that doesn't hold your interest from beginning to end. To say one is better than another is to cheat those who haven't seen the show yet from discovering how good all of them are. If one had to be chosen though, I would say it involved a serial killer in prison who has inspired, and perhaps connected with, a copycat killer. The game of cat and mouse he plays with Cal, manipulating the science that Cal has studying his entire life, made for a well made episode.The acting here is stupendous. Tim Roth is an underappreciated talent known perhaps more to the indie film crowd than the mainstream moviegoer. But that should all change with the character of Cal Lightman and what Roth brings to him. Arrogant yet troubled, seemingly uncaring yet deeply rooted in his affections for friends and family, confrontational yet spending most of his time observing, all are aspects of the character that Roth brings to the screen with apparent ease.The supporting cast does an equally fine job, not just bringing to focus Roth's character but adding to it by showing off their own as well. You feel concern for Gillian being taken advantage of by her husband. You want Ria to succeed. You hope Loker won't do something stupid and then not lie about it. You root for them all.Now is your chance to sit back and watch this series with back to back episodes at your leisure. When you're finished, you'll be angry that the new season hasn't begun yet. And you'll begin to start watching people differently, looking for those tell tale signs that they're lying. All because you've watched a great TV show on DVD."
"I love this season.  I have seen body language experts before, and this just adds to the experience, I think the actors are great.  The lead reminds me of Michael J. Fox."
"It shipped as scheduled, in the condition promised, at a good price.  I love the show.  What else do you need to know?"
"I love crime shows, and this one comes at it from a really unexpected angle. Tim Roth is great, and the ins and outs of the relationships you see developing keep me wanting to see how things turn out.  Well played!  I wish there were more seasons of this show to stream! If you're a crime show junkie like me I'd definitely recommend giving it a look:)"
"Sorry this series ended.  Very well done, and fascinating subjects covered pretty well.Liked how the actors all were quite different, but each one contributed something unique and help solve the mystery!"
"I watched this series when it was primetime but due to work, I missed many episodes. Hate to say I was never a big fan of Tim Roth but I love him in this! He is believable. He is perfect for this part! I find myself watching peoples faces and expressions more since watching it. I'm not sure if it really works but from what I've seen I think it proves to be true. I like the relationships between the characters and have started on season 2.If you like drama and have an open mind, I think you will enjoy Lie to Me as much as I do."
Not sure why this show wasn't renewed after 3 seasons. I love the action and suspense and look into deception.
This is such a great show I can hardly put my kindle down. The actors are the best. I am so glad season. 2 & 3 r on prime also
"This show is built around the idea of being able to detect when a person is lying by the presence or absence of facial and body cues.  The Lightman Group, comprised of Dr. Lightman and a talented group of associates are  engaged by various individuals and groups to determine if a lie is being told, and who is lying.  This job is not as cut and dry and it sounds.  The group uncovers much during their investigation.  Meanwhile, we are given glimpses into the lives of each of the main characters, each of whom is lying about or hiding something.  Really good show."
"I hate to say this, but I was not aware of how good this series is until a few weeks ago my sister-in-law told me to give it a try. I had seen the series available for purchase but never felt compelled to watch it. But with the recommendation my wife and I sat down to watch at least one episode. Holy sh...! The experience was so much better than expected that it was almost funny.The premise of the series is truly interesting. Dr. Cal Lightman is one of the world's preeminent authorities in deception detection. He studies the micro-expressions in people's faces and can determine if they are lying and what is the emotion that dominates when asked different questions. He has a company with a huge team of people that help him use these methods to help different organizations and private individuals to find the truth.The cases presented in this episode are varied and always engaging. We typically get two cases per episode, which allows the creators to blend in Lightman's sidekicks in each of these. The other thing I do which I love is illustrate the emotions characters in the series are experiencing by showing them in slow motion and then also showing still images of public figures with those same facial expressions. Many times I found myself laughing at this, and no public figure is spared.Besides the main plot lines in each episode, we also get to little by little see more about the private lives of the characters, which I always enjoy. In particular, there is a portion of the story dealing with Cal's business partner, Foster, and her marriage that gives an added level of complexity to the story. We also have ""the natural"", a young woman with a hard past that has the ability to read people before any formal training. Her relationship with Cal, her mentor, is always explosive and keeps us on our toes.The whole case does a great job with their acting. There is a significant portion of the action that has to do with facial expressions, and they are all proficient in this area. However, I do have to mention Tim Roth separately because he is truly amazing. The role of Cal fits him to a T and he is really convincing in his performance. Without him the series would not be the same.The bottom line is that this series cannot me missed. We have devoured this first season and are already a few episodes into the next one."
why isn't this on regular television or directv? the lightman company and its cast keep you watching and you want more.
Still fascinated at the notion of reading expressions of the minutest display.  The stories are engaging and touching when people are really faced for what they are doing.
I marvel at the clever scripts. I marvel at the assemblage visuals to support the inventive scripts. I marvel at the actors that pull this off. The film editor must be a genius to intertwine all the pieces in to a cohesive story line. BRAVO! Making all the pieces fit into the premise of this inspired &#34;who done the bad deed&#34; is astonishing to me. Body language and facial clues expose everyone to scrutiny. This is the most &#34;unique&#34; show I've seen in years. pat on the back to all .. and five stars from me.. to you...
Sorry it ended. Enjoyed it very much. The actors and writers were very entertaining. Wish there was another season to see.
"An exceptional series ""Lie To Me"" appeared (at least to me) mysteriously on Fox's schedule and quickly moved from an unknown quantity to one of the best shows on TV. The Blu-ray looks exceptionally good be aware that there is a signficiant amount of grain which is an intentional look for the show. The images are crisp, sharp and colorful audio sounds terrific as well. Lightman is the Sherlock Holmes of our generation.Separating lies from the truth is Dr. Cal Lightman's (Tim Roth)business. He's studied people from a variety of cultures and discovered that we have universal expressions that we use when we're telling the truth, lying or under stress. He uses these skills with his collegues at the Lightman Group to help uncover a terrorist operating on U.S. soil, who caused an explosion at a construction site which resulted in the crew being buried alive and to find out who a imprisoned serial rapist is using on the outside to continue his crime spree on the outside. In the process Lightman often alienates his own staff including Dr. Gillian Foster (Kelli Williams), his protege Ria Torres (Monica Raymund) and his own family. Knowing the truth and the tells about who is lying and why can change your life, damage your relationship with your wife, daughter and others but also save people. Once you've turned the ability on it's impossible to turn if off again making life difficult for Lightman and those around him.We get all the uncut first season episodes plus a behind-the-scenes featurette on the creation of the show featuring the show creator/producers/writers featurin plenty of clips from the first season to illustrate their point.Interestingly, the producers and cast are asked who the biggest liar is on the show....you'll be interested in the result. We also get deleted scenes from the show. The show looks quite nice in its home digital debut.Truly the only thing missing from this set are commentary tracks. These would have been nice to hear as we could have heard about the genesis of various scripts, changes that occurred between writing/shooting and the thought process of the directors/actors in the episode. Aside from that minor flaw, ""Lie to Me"" is an exceptional TV show."
"I will never look at people in the same way again,,,,great characters , and educational too !Very well done , and the stories keep it all interesting."
"I love this show! I had seen only 2 of them years ago and was fascinated by the premise, production and cast. To have all 3 seasons is a feast that is my day end treat. The main character, Cal Lightman, of The Lightman Group, is a psychologist who has developed a practice around 'reading' micro features and reactions of people during different stressor moments. He is the quirky feature. His team appease the general public and buffer with authorities. His Irish accent is just enough. I watch him and wonder how much is his perfect ACTING style and how much is what he naturally brings. Unusual, creative & enjoyable."
"This film was shot in 1994, released in 1997, and aired on MST3K in 1999. I would have to say that this is one of the best episodes of the last season, if not in the top 20 of the entire series."
"This episode is awfully fantastic, but the movie is just... bad!  It is one of the worst movies that we have ever seen, but that makes it so perfect for this show.  The only cure for this movie is some good Chinese delivery!"
"LASERBLAST is a nearly plot-free sci-fi film about a man who finds an alien laser weapon, becomes possessed by it, and goes berserk. It's the perfect fodder for immolation by Mike and his silly sidekicks. LASERBLAST -like MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE, BRIDE OF THE MONSTER, THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS, etc.-  is a schlock classic in its own right. As such, the unintentional humor tends to make the MST3K guys' job a lot easier! The jokes sort of write themselves!..."
This film has a whole lot of nothing going on. Thank goodness that the MST3K crew could take care of all this nothingness with their riffing! A must watch MST3K and not a bad place to start either.
"Because MST3k is sort of a show within a show within a movie, I think you need to look at the individual parts in order to rate the episode.The movie: Poor Billy.  Neglected by his mom - harassed by the local deep South Cops (even though he lives in CA) - forced to drive a 70's van that doesn't even have cool air brushed paintings - hated by all - picked on by all (even that guy who played the nerd in every late 70's movies).  But Billy will get his revenge with his.... Laserblast!!!  Basically this movie is a story of a picked on kid who finds a weapon and then blows stuff up.  And that is just about as deep as this movie gets.  The only really great part is the stop motion turtle-like aliens that have been sent to retrieve the laserblast gun; they are actually rather cute and I did like their weird language.  But the rest of the movie is not very good.  OK, maybe it is one of the better MST3k reviewed movies - but only a person with no knowledge of movies would ever compare this stinker to a movie like ""Amadeus"".The Host Segments: All of them are funny.  By this point, Mike and the bots were free to do want they want during the skits (compared to referencing parts from the film) and they clearly have fun mocking other science fiction staples.  MST3k fans will want to watch all of the segments as this is the last episode for a beloved character.Riffs: There are a lot of riffs and almost all of them are very hilarious.  At one point not only was there non-stop riffing but Mike and the bots were cracking each other up with their lines.Overall: This was the last episode of MST3k on Comedy Central.  The staff knew there was a chance that this could be their last outing and it is clear that the writers were bringing their ""A"" game.  One of the better MST3k episodes for general viewers and required watching for MST3k fans."
"Some movies are so perfectly suited for the MST3K treatment, that it's as though god created them specifically for that purpose. HOBGOBLINS, EEEGAH!, POD PEOPLE. These are some of the wondrous gems of yore. Well, add WEREWOLF to this hyper-schlock short-list! The plot: A lycanthrope skeleton is excavated in Flagstaff, Arizona. Hair sprouts. Mayhem commences. All the qualifications are there- petrified characters, driftwood-quality ""acting"", ding-a-ling dialogue, and virtually no storyline! Mike and the bots play this ""film"" like a finely-tuned instrument made of pure Cheddar! Yep, this is another unwatchable mess, saved by the team. Behold! The brilliance of ten trillion suns! Amen..."
"One of my personal favorites. Not a bad place to start if you want to get into MST3K. It is a classic, the riffs are non-stop, and the direct-to-video nature of it just screams to be riffed."
"This is the funniest MST3000 ever!  The bad acting, lousy plot, and outrageous (in a bad way) special effects make this a real howler."
"Ah, werewolf movies. They're like the little girl with the curl -- when they're good, they're very very good, and when they're bad, they're.... fodder for MST3K.Such is the fate of ""Werewolf,"" Tony Zarindast's tale of lycanthropy and stupidity -- a sloppy, ineptly-assembled pile of FAIL from the first scene to the last, with acting worthy of a Razzie and a plot apparently dreamed up during a bad hangover. So of course, Mike and the bots tackle all the hilarious stupidity with good grace... when they aren't having identity crises.Mike's attempts to escape back down to Earth are foiled by Pearl and Brain Guy, so he ends up climbing right back to the Satellite just in time for ""Werewolf."" When they aren't watching the movie, Mike accidentally becomes infected with Crow's essence and begins turning into a WereCrow. I don't think the world is ready for two of them.As for the movie itself: it's about a bunch of archaeologists who find a ""wur-wilf"" skeleton out in the desert, which causes one of them to transform. Designated evil scientist Yuri (Jorge Rivero) decides to experiment by infecting random people with lycanthropy, and one of the accidental victims is is a greasy writer named Paul (Federico Cavalli) who is interested in the ever-wooden Nathalie (the wooden Adrianna Miles).""Wurwilf""... I'm sorry, ""Werewolf"" is not the worst movie that ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" has ever reviewed, but it's pretty bad. Everything here is worthy of mockery -- the bad special effects, the cardboard characters, silly cinematography (the girl who can't run through a mud puddle), the awful costumes (is that a bear? A bat?) and Yuri's ever-changing hair.But of course, the endless stream of mockery turned out by Mike, Joel and the robots is absolutely gutsplitting. They constantly snark bad continuity (""Did those oil barrels just leap out in front of him?""), stupid characters (mock the stupid Russian chick's accent -- ""You and Noel is in it for fame and fortune? But over my dead body!"") and constant running jokes (the fact that Natalie is clearly dumb as a stump).Even the framing stuff is hilarious, with Mike becoming a WereCrow (""... and you know, I'm perfectly comfortable with that, yeah""), and the three main characters dressing up like a 50s girl band and singing a peppy pop song about falling in love with a werewolf.The movie is awful, the snark is hilarious, and the wurwilf is about as frightening as one of the monsters from Twilight. One of my all-time favorite episodes of MST3K."
"Be""waurrrr"" the surprise ending and make sure that you are never cut by any weird bones.  Also, defending yourself by crossing your arms over your face may not work a werewolf, but it could (potentially) help you survive this movie!"
This is my #2 favorite MST3K episode. Be prepared for 80s references - these make it hard to be a perfect film for everyone. The acting is just terrible and the storyline full of plot holes - excellent MST3K fodder.
"""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" has a few of those awesome, special episodes that not only hit all the right notes, but actually go even further. One such episode is ""Soultaker,"" a clumsy supernatural thriller that seems like an 80s teenage version of ""Carnival of the Damned,"" only with teenagers and hair metal. And guess who make cameos!The Satellite of Love"" is malfunctioning badly, complete with Gypsy getting mean and transmissions of Martin van Buren (I never understood that one). Pearl is uninterested in saving Mike and the bots, so she simply sends them the movie ""Soultaker."" But a mysterious ship is flying alongside the Satellite, keeping them in a tractor beam. Who or what is saving Mike and the bots?As for the movie, it's about a bunch of teenagers driving home from a concert... festival... thing, and they get in a nasty car wreck after they see a man in black standing in the road. And as the man in black pursues them, two of the remaining teens discover that they are actually BRAIN-DEAD -- and their comatose bodies will be taken off life support at midnight.""Soultaker"" is not the worst movie that MST3K has done -- it's not even the worst amateur attempt at one by someone who has a ""great story"" to tell. It's theologically muddled, inconsistent and has a lot of plot holes (how do DEAD PEOPLE operate the elevator?), but it has some decent moments. It's awkward and clumsy, and that's what makes it bad.That is something you can't say about the Mike, Tom and Crow segments, which are perfect. These guys had snarking down to an art form, whether it's joking about the clumsy script (""But shes upper middle class and we're slightly lower middle!"") or the funny-looking actors (""It's a catcher's mitt with eyes!""). And of course, many jokes about Joe Estevez.And the hosting segments are also fun, with Mike struggling to command the Satellite, even as Gypsy insults him and Tom and Crow have a wet T-shirt contest. But those segments become AWESOME when a pair of familiar faces drop in for a visit... guess who!""Mystery Science Theater 3000: Soultaker"" is one of those must-see episodes of the classic snark series -- it's funny, strange, and has CAMEOS."
"The other reviewers are right.  This one gets better as the movie progresses and the ending is one of the best.  The bath scene with the mom is down right creepy, but even more so may be the parents' utter lack of concern in hospital.  Maybe the actors didn't really know what was going on???  I guess that applies to the entire movie, though, so kick back and enjoy the seemingly endless one-liners."
"B-rate Soviet sci-fi! It may not be the best episode MST3K has to offer, it does fit the series perfectly as a film to be riffed."
I have been a big fan of MST 3000 for years.  It is absolutely brainless and perfectly snarky.  A great time-waster!
"After a week off, Dollhouse returned with ""Haunted,"" another wonderful, high-octane episode that brings a completely new dimension to the concept behind the series. This brings up even more ethical questions about the Dollhouse that I've never thought of before, and makes the viewer think a little bit harder about characters in the show.After Adelle's wealthy friend, Margaret, dies, she imprints the woman's memories into Echo allowing her, in a sense, to have a kind of life after death. Adelle and Echo/Margaret attend the woman's funeral, since she wonders just how many people actually loved her when she was alive. After some unexpected happenings at the funeral, Margaret decides that she wants to find out who killed her.Past this point the viewers are thrown into a surprising original twist on the age-old ""whodunnit"" murder mystery (complete with typical line-up of suspects, all this motives). I thought this was a fresh and much welcome departure from the rest of the series and allowed Dollhouse to add a little mystery into the mix. The entire plot was perfectly put together and filled with intense surprises that kept me guessing up until the very end.The story's unique approach also forces viewers to think a little harder about what kind of world they will leave behind after they die. Are their relationships and lives just as they imagine them to be, or are there some sinister secrets lurking underneath it all?Back at the Dollhouse, it's time for Topher annual ""diagnostic test."" The purpose behind this isn't really explained, but it results in Topher imprinting Sierra with a personality that makes her the perfect nerd-friend for him, complete with knowledge of MMORPGs, laser tag, Xbox 360 and science-y stuff. While these scenes are absolutely hilarious and feature great dialogue, they are serve as a kind of window into Topher's character -and just how lonely he is.Topher's not the only lonely one. Agent Bellard is feeling lonelier by the minute as he wrestles with the truth of Mellie's identity. As Bellard pushes closer to the Dollhouse, he makes a believer in the FBI office after the two try to investigate Mellie's past.In the end the mystery of Margaret's death comes to a satisfying conclusion, despite the unbelievable idea that Margaret willingly gives up her stay in Echo's body and potential eternal life. However, I can easily overlook this detail after the rest of ""Haunted"" kept me guessing the entire time.Sadly, there are strong rumors going around that Dollhouse is going to be canceled after the first season -just like Fox cancels all of its good shows. I've also read online that Fox will not air the final episode of the season, but Joss and co. are planning to include it on the DVD."
Love to watch it.  Kinda surreal syfy feel to it.  The major actors are great!  Really like it.  Very action packed.
"Intriguing, original and cool!  Joss Whedon's ""dollhouse"" Season 1 is an enjoyable series that manages to captivates your attention form beginning to end.In 2009, Joss Whedon returned to television with his fourth television show (since ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer, ""Angel"" and ""Firefly"") known as ""dollhouse"".The series received quite a bit of promotion for FOX and also became a series that featured less commercials (television spots were sold at a premium) and generated hype among many fans online who preferred to watch the series on [...].Needless to say, it was a series that didn't have the greatest of ratings but as of right now, FOX has greenlighted a second season.Here is a spoiler-free synopsis of what to find on ""dollhouse"" season 1:DISC 1:* Episode 1 - Ghost - We are introduced to ""Echo"" who is imprinted as a hostage negotiator and must save a child who has been kidnapped.  We are introduced to Topher Brink (Fran Kranz) who is the intelligent hacker responsible for imprinting the dolls and other key players who work for dollhouse and the various dolls that Echo interacts with.* Episode 2 - The Target - Echo has been imprinted as a date for a wealthy businessman.  What she doesn't know is that the businessman is a killer.  Meanwhile, an active named Alpha has somehow gone crazy and murdered many staff and dolls inside the facility.  Also, Echo meets her new handler Body Langton (Harry J. Lennix).* Episode 3 - Stage Fright - Echo has been imprinted as a backup singer for a pop diva who has been having problems with an obsessed fan.* Episode 4 - Gray Hour - Echo has been imprinted as a high tech thief.* Episode 5 -True Believer - Echo has been imprinted as a member of a religious cult but her goal is to infiltrate the area.Disc 2:* Episode 6 - Man on the Street - Something has gone wrong with active Sierra (Dichen Lachman) which leads Boyd to do an investigation.  Meanwhile, Echo comes into contact with Agent Ballard.* Episode 7 - Echoes - A psychotropic drug is released in a college research lab and all actives must work together to find out who stole the drug.* Episode 8 - Needs - Actives Echo, Sierra, Victor and November are somehow freed from their pods and try to escape the Dollhouse.* Episode 9 - Spy in the House of Love - DeWitt is away on business travel and Topher finds a chip and alerts Head of Security, Lawrence Dominic that there is a spy within the Dollhouse.* Episode 10 - Haunted - A wealthy woman named Margaret has been uploading her personality to the dollhouse every month because she feels that she may be murdered one day.  When that day comes, Echo is imprinted with her memories and now must find the person who is responsible Margaret's death.Disc 3:* Episode 11 - Briar Rose - Agent Ballard and a hacker named Stephen Kepler sneak into the Dollhouse to free Echo.* Episode 12 - Omega - Stephen Kepler turns out to be Alpha and has kidnapped Echo. Now Agent Ballard has no choice but to team up DeWitt and Boyd in order to find Echo.Also, included on Disc 3 are two episodes.  The first is a pilot which was created and not aired on television.  The pilot features storyline elements that were featured as flashbacks in other episodes and thus was not aired on television.  As for episode 13, the following was created in order for Joss Whedon to meet the 13-episode on a DVD release quota and was not aired on television (but was aired at San Diego Comic-Con 2009).  Also, in case if the series was canceled, episode 13 offered insight to the future of the Dollhouse and an ending for fans.  If not, then the episode would tease of a future to come.* Pilot Episode - Echo - The introduction to Echo and her joining the Dollhouse.* Episode 13 - Epitaph One - In 2019, something terrible has happened and it seems the technology from the Dollhouse has been misused by the Rossum Corporation and used by another country on its citizens and eventually leading to an apocalyptic storyline where mankind and those who have been imprinted are at war.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Dollhouse"" receives its High Definition transfer and is featured in 1080p (Widescreen 1:78:1).  As with many television series on DVD or Blu-ray, one thing that becomes evident is digital artifacting due to compression.  Some series on Blu-ray have been quite exceptional but those series are typically highly popular series with a tremendous budget.  The good news is that ""Dollhouse"" does look very good compared to how it looked on television and even on HD via online.  Outdoor scenes are quite vibrant, detail can be seen onscreen quite easily from closeups of the talents faces, wounds and even the Dollhouse living area.  Blacks are solid and skin tones are natural.The bad news is that for a television series, there is a sign of softness (which probably comes from use of DNR - digital noise reduction).  There is also compression artifacts that show up on video with red backgrounds and for a Blu-ray release, while it does look very good, it doesn't look great.  But its hard to tell if this was because there are five episodes on one disc (other series on Blu-ray try to have four episodes and utilize the entire disc for picture and audio quality).  Granted, I may be a bit nitpicky when it comes to this but by the series does look very good, but somehow I felt it could have been much better and less soft and waxy at times.As for audio, the series is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  The series is dialogue and musical driven, thus the majority of the series is mostly utilized on front and center channels.  Surround channels are utilized in certain action scenes with gunshots or even the sound made at the end of the episode, really sound good on HD.  But for the most part, although there are action sequences when it comes to people fighting, this is not a series that utilizes many explosions or intense action sequences.Also, its important to let people know that for a series that does utilize quite a bit of music, especially in the first episode, the music from the series is kept and not changed for the Blu-ray or DVD release.  Dialogue and music are crystal clear and understandable.Subtitles are presented in English SDH, Spanish, French and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:""dollhouse"" features quite a few special features.  Included are:* Audio Commentaries - Certain episodes on each disc contain audio commentary.  Personally, I didn't like how the audio commentary section was prepared on the menus because you have to select an individual episode and by a click of the button, it will either start the episode or give you an option of audio commentary.  So, it would have been nice if there was a way to find out which episode had audio commentary via an insert or even on back of the cover.  With that being said, the following episodes have commentary:  ""Ghost"" features director Joss Whedon and Eliza Dushku, ""Man on the Street"" and ""Epitaph One"" featuring Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen.  First, let me say that the commentary for each of these are hilarious and enjoyable to listen to.  For ""Ghost"", Joss and Eliza tend to have fun and really do not get to technical on how scenes were created and are more like buddies.  On the other hand, Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen are quite interesting. The two real-life married couple discuss  certain scenes and informative behind-the-scenes information but also tell a lot of jokes.  And for a first in commentary, it's the first time I have ever heard a couple ask for sex for later in the night.  For the most part, the commentary is just fun to listen to and for a episode like ""Epitaph One"", you hear how that episode had to be made on a short budget and who knows where it would lead to in the second season.* Making Dollhouse - (20:47) Featured in High Definition.  Although the commentary is not technical, Joss Whedon definitely gets technical with this featurette.  You learn everything in regards tot he creation of ""dollhouse"".  From pre-production, casting, disagreements with the studio and the whole mess with the pilot episode. Very informative featurette!* Deleted Scenes - (29:46) A total of 23 deleted scenes that can be watched via ""play all"" or separately.  Featured in HD.* Coming Home - (7:10) Director Joss Whedon talks about working with his staff of writers.  People he has worked with from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Angel"" and ""Firefly"".  The writers talk about how they love working with Joss and Eliza Dushku enjoying the company of people she worked with before.  Featured in HD.* Finding Echo - (5:07) A featurette in High Definition featuring Joss Whedon and Eliza Dushku.  Both talk about what they enjoy about working with each other and both compliment each other.* Designing the Perfect Dollhouse - (5:59) Featured in HD, director Joss Whedon takes us on a tour of the Dollhouse.  Showing us the creation of the set and comparing the concept art to the finalized set.* A Private Engagement - (5:44) Featured in HD is a humorous featurette in which the crew and talent discuss what they feel about the concept of Dollhouse and would they take advantage of it if it was real and what would they do if they came across the technology.* Original Unaired Pilot Episode - Echo - The introduction to Echo and her joining the Dollhouse.  Featured in HD.* Episode 13 (Bonus Episode)  - Epitaph One - In 2019, something terrible has happened and it seems the technology of the Dollhouse has led to an apocalyptic storyline where mankind and those who have been imprinted are at war.  Featured in HD.JUDGMENT CALL:""dollhouse"" is an enjoyable series.  As a fan of Joss Whedon's work (television, film and comic books),  you literally know that you're in for a treat.  I've always thought that how his mind works, many of us who enjoy his work know that these storylines that can look incredible on television but also on film. His utilization of characters and character development is just quality.""dollhouse"" is a series that eventually gets better and better with each episode.  In a way, I think it works that there are 12-episodes as opposed to the Buffy and Angel years that had nearly two dozen.  This allows for less filler episodes and getting to the focal point of the storyline of ""dollhouse"" about Echo being a special kind of active, Agent Ballard trying to bring down the Dollhouse and of course, a rogue active named Alpha who wants to go further and destroy those who work at the Dollhouse and use the technology for other means.There are many characters in the series but with each episode, they are carefully integrated to each episode and amongst the development for each character, you get to know enough backstory to have interest in them.Also, Whedon's future apocalyptic storyline definitely was intriguing.  I will say that the bonus 13th episode ""Epitaph One"" definitely has exciting plans for the future and although the episode may have been created just in case the series is canceled, nevertheless it opens a potential of a future that is quite exciting and not sure if that storyline will be part of season two.Overall, I really enjoyed Joss Whedon's ""dollhouse"".  Each episode is well-written and enjoyable, especially as the series progresses.  I really hope the series makes it through its five year plan.As for the Blu-ray release, the Blu-ray features a good number of bells and whistles to make this season worth owning.  Granted, this is not the most beautiful looking television series on High Definition but the series looks great and you definitely get your money's worth with this release.Overall, Joss Whedon's ""dollhouse"" Season One is a wonderful series to own.  Definitely recommended!"
"i missed this on its original tv run. I took a chance on amazon and binge watched both seasons. a terrific show, terrific cast. especially season 1. the cast is terrific, really a sci fi (sort of) classic, highly recommended."
"The first few episodes serve as baby steps into what becomes a thrill-ride of mystery. You can't seem to walk straight ahead into anything involving this show; the characters are constantly evolving and not always for the better. I truly think this show was a little before its time.As the show wears on, we start to see the underbelly of some great and epic beast, impossible to control once it had been given more or less free reign. The final episode, the bonus 'Epitaph' is creepy on the level of the Terminator.The acting is all above par; I was leery of a show seemingly headed by Eliza Dushku. I had never seen her give much of a performance to my tastes. But she kicks the show into a high gear, playing everything from an innocent and lost soul, to a ardent believer of God, a mercenary, sociopath, an eco-terrorist, and decisive leader, each to a magnificent level that is very plausible - not realistic of course, but just outside our realm of reach. As it has been said: ""Man's reach exceeds his grasp"". They weren't whistling Dixie on that point...The bonus features are very enjoyable, from commentaries on through a rather expected list of special feature sundries. The sound design isn't going to be winning any awards either, but then again this vehicle was designed for television. Like many of Whedon's projects, it is the characters that keep us coming back for more.The show itself gives us a freakishly deep look into what it means to be a human being. I don't think I can simply explain the show. It is beyond ""fun"", as I sometimes describe film and whatnot. This is the kind of show that challenges the viewer to take that long look at one's self. And an individual may very well not like what they see. And as serious as the show is, there is the trademarked Whedon-esque rapport. Topher, to put a name on one. Topher, no matter who plays him. And to get that reference, watch the show. I refuse to provide anything resembling a spoiler. It just wouldn't be fair."
"Love this one......off the wall, off the chart......always keeps us on the edge of our seats.....The language does not offend us, and that's really important !"
"I gave this five stars because the show is riveting.  From the beginning it captured my attention and remained that way until the end of the show.  It has everything I could ask for in a production.  The story lines show imagination, intrigue, and terrific acting.  If I could have given it 10 stars it would deserve it.Knight68"
"I like the actors and the story line, even if it is a little farfetched. Sci Fi right? I am still waiting to see if the director is a doll."
"I had never heard of the dollhouse and I may be associating it with the valley of the dolls. There is no connection between them. The Dollhouse is a disturbing, deep look at morality and social mores and the possible ramifications of technology. Joss Whedon is just full of unusual ideas and great shows. It is unbelievable...but in a good way. I really enjoyed the entire series. It just keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat. A great show."
"If you're like me you didn't even consider watching dollhouse because of the name, ick. After rolling my eyes at the show I now find out it's by Joss Whedon and Eliza Dushku is the main star...well how can you go wrong? If you like the other Joss Whedon shows you'll like this one, lots of action, imaginative scripts, and good acting. It's also nice to see the familiar faces from other shows, especially because some of them are playing such different parts...I guess I shouldn't admit it, because it shows how tacky I am, but suddenly I realize they can act, as opposed to those actors that can only do well in one type of role.Some of Joss Whedon's shows took a season to really get going but the script and cast is tight from the pilot with dollhouse, oh and now that I understand the name I like it. Definitely give this show a shot."
"Another great series from Joss Whedan, that never got a fair run on network TV. It has twisty and thought provoking plot line that really make you think."
"The reality of the concept is scary.  Private funding is always what makes best supposed fiction.  The individuals that shared their concept of missing people etc... made a valid point, which made the show a dazzling concept."
"Over the past fifteen years, no one has made more interesting television than Joss Whedon.  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER helped revolutionize television, not only making the empowered female hero a staple of television, but popularizing the long story arc and introducing the concept of the body count.  ANGEL did little innovation in its own right, but still managed to roll out several seasons of excellent and consistently fascinating television.  And FIREFLY not only brought new ground by blending the Western and Sci-fi, but brought a grittiness to the genre that later BATTLESTAR GALACTICA took to new heights.  DOLLHOUSE, however, is both a far more challenging and adventurous series than any of these.  Is it as consistently successful as these?  Absolutely not.  Does it represent Joss Whedon's best work?  Here the answer gets dicey.  Speaking strictly on the basis of what has been shown so far the answer would be ""No,"" but a more honest and accurate answer would be, ""Potentially.""It is no secrete that DOLLHOUSE is considered a long shot to be renewed.  The fault largely has to be laid at the feet of the executives of FOX.  This show, unlike virtually every other show that FOX has ever done, is cutting edge and adventurous, taking risks unlike anything else you'll find on commercial TV.  Had the show been placed on any night of the week other than Friday it unquestionably would have attracted a healthy viewership.  After all, there is no question that a large number of people are actually watching it.  Between live viewers on the ""death night"" of Friday, the large number of people who DVR the show, the huge number of people who download it via Torrents, and those who buy it on iTunes or Amazon's Unbox, a whole lot of people watch this show.  But FOX shoved the show into the least promising time slot of the entire week, Friday nights.  And what was the result?  What anyone would imagine it would be:  no one watched it live.  DVR?  Yes.  Download?  Yes.  But live?  No.  The problem with Friday nights is that everyone in the 18-49 age group that advertisers desire is that they are all out doing stuff.  The shows that have good ratings that night, like GHOST WHISPERER, attracts primarily viewers over the age of 49.  FOX is responsible for the low ratings of DOLLHOUSE by not putting it on a better night.  But despite that it has a show that plenty of people are watching, only not live.DOLLHOUSE is built around an extremely difficult concept:  people voluntarily (though not uncoerced) agreeing to become more or less indentured servants (which also involves nothing short of prostitution).  Imprinted with the personalities who anyone needed for their jobs, the ""Actives"" who populate the Dollhouse can undertake virtually any job imaginable, for a fee.  The first several episodes were somewhat slow and dragged a bit, a series of standalone episodes strongly encouraged by FOX.  But once the show moved away from the ""assignment of the week"" it became the most bracing and exciting hour on television.  The second half of the season featured one absolutely breathtaking episode after another, culminating in the final two, where the mysterious ""Alpha"" finally put in an appearance (played by the wonderful Alan Tudyk) makes his appearance.  The show featured one startling twist and shock after another, some that could be anticipated (like many, I had guessed something crucial about Amy Acker's character)) and others that could not.  It became a show that was the least predictable on TV.The question now is whether FOX will allow us to find out what happens next.  Due to their terrible decision to put the show on Friday nights the ratings bombed (the original plan was to put the show on Mondays just before 24), which is unfortunately still the only came in town for the networks and advertisers, despite the otherwise large number of people who watch the series.  I do have one hope for the continuance of DOLLHOUSE as we know it.  Kevin Reilly, the head of FOX since the summer of 2007, has not been out-of-control in canceling shows.  Unlike the FOX of the past, the Kevin Reilly FOX has been far more sober in canceling shows (though he has inexplicably renewed what is arguably the most hated show on TV, `TIL DEATH, which has the lowest viewer rating of any active show on TV).  While head of NBC, Reilly made a habit of renewing critically acclaimed but low-rated series, like 30 ROCK, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, and THE OFFICE.  Two of those three later became hits.  My hope with DOLLHOUSE is that Reilly will remember that great shows have a potential of growing an audience, if you put them on the right night.DOLLHOUSE is one of many shows of recent years that focuses extensively or even primarily on the question of what makes a person.  BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, for instance, dealt at length about who could be said to be a person.  In the first three seasons of that show Sharon Agathon (who was, interestingly, involved with Karl Agathon, who was played by Tahmoh Penikett, who plays FBI agent Paul Ballard on DOLLHOUSE) is at the center of whether or not she is a person, despite being a cybernetic machine.  Living in a world where our self-identities are often the construct of the things that we identify with and purchase, products of the consumer society in which we live.  Questions of authenticity are at the heart of our society.  If you know many of the thinkers and writers with whom Joss Whedon is familiar there is no question that he is familiar with these kinds of issues.  Many are not comfortable with this.  Whedon made his mark as one of the great feminists on television (and interestingly DOLLHOUSE stars Eliza Dushku, whose mother, like Whedon's, is a well known feminist).  He has taken a lot of flak for the prostitution that the ""Dolls"" on the show engage in.  The women are very much victims and there are few images of empowered women, completely unlike BUFFY with Buffy and Willow, ANGEL with Fred and Cordelia, and FIREFLY with River and Zoe.  But the world is messy and complex and heavily nuanced.  This show interacts and dialogues with that complexity.  We are having a crisis of identity.  We allow too many influences in society dictate who we are.  How can we be authentic human beings when we do not have control over our own personhood?  These questions transcend issues of feminism and penetrate to the question of what it means to be a person.Although there may not be a Season Two of DOLLHOUSE, Joss Whedon has produced a wonderfully self-contained series even if it doesn't continue.  Unliked the vast majority of TV creators and writers, Whedon has always felt that each season of a series should end in a way so that if it is the last episode, fans aren't left unnecessarily suffering.  The final episode of ever season of every show he has done has not ended on a cliffhanger unless the show had already been renewed before production on the finale had begun.  Seasons One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, and Seven of BUFFY as well as Seasons One, Two, Four, and Five of ANGEL could all serve as series ends.  They already knew that ANGEL had been renewed when the finale of Season Three was filming.  FIREFLY was cancelled right in the middle of filming, so it never had the opportunity of any kind of ending.The DVDs will feature an episode that FOX currently has no plan on broadcasting.  It guest stars Felicia Day (one of the Potentials from Season Seven of BUFFY and the love female lead in DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG) and purportedly does some exceptionally over-the-top things.  Kristin of Eonline has reported that if FOX does not renew DOLLHOUSE, Joss Whedon is interested in developing a new show out of that final though unbroadcast episode of DOLLHOUSE.  Hopefully, this time he will try to do something on one of the cable networks.  Instead of FOX, I would like to see him on the Sci Fi channel (or as it is soon to be known, SyFy) or HBO or Showtime or even AMC.  Because we haven't seen this episode yet, we have no idea what direction a new Joss Whedon series based on this would look like.  But if it is even a fraction as interesting as DOLLHOUSE, I am game.  The truth is, this show should never have been on FOX to begin with.  That it did was a result of Eliza Dushku having a contract with FOX to develop a new show.  She immediately asked Joss Whedon to create that show.  I think she has done a great job as Echo in the series, but I hope that we'll continue to see her either on FOX in this show or on a cable channel in the same role on a new show.Will this be the end of DOLLHOUSE?  I hope not.  I had grown to have almost no interest in FOX and hadn't been watching any FOX shows in several seasons, but first with TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES and then with DOLLHOUSE and FRINGE, I thought it was finally becoming a network that was interested in exciting and complex programming.  And maybe it will be.  Time will tell.  But here is what confuses me.  There is no shortage of great series on TV.  But so many of those shows are lightly watched.  Some are on cable and as a result are sheltered by lowered expectations.  MAD MEN, BREAKING BAD, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, and TRUE BLOOD are all interesting or even great shows that get very few viewers, far less than even failing shows on CBS or NBC or ABC.  Then there are more heavily watched shows like PUSHING DAISIES, ELI STONE, TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES, CHUCK, and DOLLHOUSE that either get cancelled or are in danger of cancellation because they are on one of the broadcast networks.  There is no question that the television industry is broken.  Viewership is in decline for all the networks for all evenings.  There is little to indicate that this is going to reverse.  But the networks have not managed to come up with any kind of functional model to deal with lessened viewership.  FOX can't figure out what to do with shows like TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES and DOLLHOUSE that are heavily watched but have few live viewers.  If FOX cancels them, in their place will go two other shows with perhaps even fewer viewers and far less critical buzz.Whatever happens, we at least got one splendid season of the always-fascinating Joss Whedon.  Hopefully we'll get more seasons of DOLLHOUSE.  If not, more seasons of some new Joss Whedon series.May 15, 2009 -- Awesome news!!!!  Against hope FOX has renewed DOLLHOUSE  for a second season!  The Hollywood Reporter broke the story but it has since been confirmed by some writers on the show.  It has been renewed for only 13 episodes, which is similar to what has happened to CHUCK and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS.  But unless one wants to quibble with the number of episodes, this is great news.  The one fly in the ointment is that FOX is apparently keeping the show on Friday night.  It seems that they have decided to keep a show going that a core group of people care passionately about rather than a show that might get slightly more viewers, but who don't care that much one way or another."
"GREAT SHOW!  I enjoy watching it over and over again. The cast is wonderful and the storylines are original.  The Wealthy can hire a &#34;Doll&#34; to be whatever they desire, for the right amount of money.  Suspenseful, action packed and great humorous quips to make you laugh.  I love Joss Whedon's creations, and this is another Gem."
"Once in a great while do you find a Gem like this show... worth every penny it cost to own on Blue Ray... The story is compelling, with a painful tinge of Machiavelli (did I spell that right). So easy it was to find myself going along for the ride... and seeing the world of 2019 depicted in Epitaph One, it was very easy to believe that the Filthy Rich and Powerful would choose to steal young bodies in their continuing explorations of selfish and profane pursuits! Is this the real truth behind the series' cancellation? That this story hits the power elite too close to home? - Be careful Joss, soon they won't let you tell your stories anymore..."
"great twists, always good to see the players turn on themselves later in the game -..... ...... ... ... ."
"I am glad Coach did not win, what a tool. I enjoyed this season being it wasnt the typical beach setting."
It was great to go back and see Coach and Tyson where they started. This is a great season and very entertaining!
"One of my favorite survivors: likeable and interesting characters, big plays, and plenty of hilarious moments from the Dragon Slayer aka coach aka who knows his birth name."
"NO SPOILERS : this season was amazing. i accidently stumbled onto this season....i hadn't watched survivor since the third season...so i knew nothing about any of the cast. so once i caught the first episode i immediately was hooked...the entire season, J.T., Steven, The Dragon Slayer, Taj....all excellent. the games are exciting, the rewards were awesome, and seriously some of the best backstabbing ever. this season, however, also had alot of heart...i truly did love the final four....good and bad...they all deserved to be there...i watched the entire series in two days...GORGEOUS scenery, excellent editing, music on point, Probst is excellent.cannot recommend this season enough....im not ruining any surprises here....im not...but three words...FAKE IMMUNITY IDOL = BRILLIANT."
"I am glad I bought the DVD's so in a year or so I can watch it again.  When Survivor goes off the air, hopefully never, but if and when they do, I have backups for my Survivor withdrawal."
"is my favorite show of all time. Tocantins is very good. Lots of wheeling and dealing. Plus coach (who I despise) meets his demise. Very satisfying to watch him lose. He IS a loser. Talks big with all his BS. But nobody believes him. He's the consummate liar. Coach, stop saying how honest you are because you make me want to barf, you stinking liar."
If nothing else we get to learn how to pronounce the season from Jeff.  I like the ability to learn of the country and culture of the area the survivors have entered.
"JT is one the strongest players to play Survivor. Stephen is one of the smartest to ever play the game. These 2 paired up makes up one of the greatest duos in survivor history. Coach is an obnoxious player who thinks he knows everything and is a big joke. This is his first appearance out of his 3 times playing and is one of a kind. Eddie George's wife Taj is in this game and probably would be voted out early but she finds something that helps her stay in the game. Tocantins is probably the worst location Survivor could ever choose. The island setting is more fitting for survivor and Africa is a good switch up because of the wildlife. There really isn't anything good about the Brazilian highlands. Exile island is a big sand dune and 2 people from opposite tribes get an opportunity to form an alliance. I didn't like Tyson at first, but he grew on me and I realized he's great at challenges and he can have a really tight knit alliance. Give Tyson a chance and he will win you over. There is a surprise vote in the beginning and turns out that it really is a good or bad thing depending on the decisions the players make after they get voted for."
I love this move and Julie Roberts and Danzel Washington are some of my favorite actors.  I am glad I purchased this movie.
"Pelican Brief has been one of my favorite movies since I first saw it.  I've seen it many times, and still get cravings every once and awhile to see it again."
"I loved this movie when it first came out.  It has continued to be excellent.  Loved the acting, the story.  Just a great movie."
"i have nothing to add to the favorable reviews of the film. It was all that a suspense film should be. Some changes were made from the book, but, as the old saying goes, we are making a film, not rewriting a book that has already been written. The cast did a fine job and, whatever your sexual preferences, there are two stars who are admirable examples of good looking people--and they could act as well.I am writing, when all this has been said time and again in many of these reviews, simply to report on the condition of my disc,since a number of recent reviews mention defects. I can't generalize beyond myself. While having material on both sides of the disc is an invitation for  oily fingerprints, with their consequences, the disc I played provided a beautiful picture and good sound (although I always use the subtitles when available----through necessity). There were no freezes or other failures with which we are all familiar.Reading a dozen, or so, more of the recent reviews, gives rise to the hypothesis that some number of people played only the first side and did not turn it over for the remainder of the film. It is a natural error if one has not encountered these label-less abominations previously, I had to get out my strongest magnifying glass in order to read the print around the inner hole in the disc which gives this information."
I've watched this movie many times and have never gotten tired of seeing it. It's intellectually engrossing due to the plot twists and the interesting legal issues that come up in the film. It's also just fun to watch because of the action and suspense. It's also educational because it exposes us to the fact that what happens in the film probably happens in real life all the time without our knowledge. It makes us look at the problems of pollution and gov't policy in regards to pollution in a new light. Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington are great in this movie!
"When I was a kid talk shows, game shows, and variety shows were all the rage featuring stars and demi-stars that if they haven't gone to the big Vegas in the sky are now pounding the stages in Branson.  Ah yes I long for the days of real stars like Rip Taylor, Lester Tyler and Willie, Charo, and Jaye P. Morgan.  ""The Great Buck Howard"" casts a lovelorn glance at those bygone times and casts aspersions at our current culture that makes celebrities of the talentless Snookis and Kardashians of the world.  ""The Amazing Kreskin"", whose life this film is loosely based on, was a little before my time so I don't have much of a reference point.  That said I can appreciate the artistry of Buck Howard, played brilliantly by John Malkovich.  Yes he's a little self-absorbed, egotistical, and difficult.  This however is a byproduct of his craft.  Sure his act is a little corny, however, it is born out of love and honed to perfection in front of the adoring gazes from the townfolk of Bakersfield and Akron.  Yes, umpteen appearances on Carson are nice but your star shines brightest when the spotlight is dimmest.  I absolutely love this film.  Even the human doorknob Colin Hanks, probably cast at the behest of producer Daddy Tom, couldn't ruin it.  His love scenes, if you want to call them that, with the hot Emily Blunt don't even register a goosebump.  Thank you Daddy Tom for letting me suck face with that hot Brit babe.  Buck Howard is the Steve Zahn, who by happenstance appears in the flick, of mentalism."
One of the very best shows on TV.  It is just amazing the footage of the wrecks. I can not wait until the next series.
This is great to see what is right under you (if you are on a boat that is) and not even know it a great show and fun.  You learn and laugh a great mix
I have only watched the first 5 or 6 episodes of the show but I'm already hooked. The storylines are compelling and its a great way to look at history from a modern perspective.
"I wish it were longer than 11 episodes. I'd like to see them pull up a big treasure.  Treasure hunting was a hobby of mine when I was in my early 30s. Never found any of the lost GOLD in Arizona, or New Mexico though. Dry panned 1/4 ounce of gold, prospecting for a whole day in the hot sun. Worth about $9.00 back in the 70s."
I have always enjoyed this program.  I mostly like the ide of finding treasure in some tropical sea or location.
"ComedyFunEntertainmentSuspense of the Grifter kindThis is a fun ride of cons, twists and turns.If you figure out where it will end up you wrote it or are really really good at spotting a every minute detail while being psychic.If  you liked Oceans 11 this is better, you will not be disappointed."
This is a terrific movie for those who enjoy the surprise endings that were there the whole time.  Naturally complex but no false holes.  It unfolds perfectly.  French with English subtitles (with the occasional English speaking exchanges).  Every member of the cast deliver awesome performances.  Stylish production with lavish settings and locations.  Another gem for Jean Dujardin (OSS 177)...
"This is a stylish crime thriller starring Jean Reno as an uber criminal who does con tricks on deserving sorts that the French call `pigeons' and many a feather gets to fly in this full on scam-athon. The synopsis is that slick grifter Ca$h (Jean Dujardin) has his finger in many crime pies, and whilst his brother is pulling another scam he gets murdered. Ca$h wants to avenge his brother and so sets out to pull off a plan so cunning that it will take a mind more devilish than him to thwart.Enter Jean Reno as Dubrreuil, or is he? They are also being chased by top police woman Julia who is a careerist crime buster, or is she? And femme fattalle Garance who is a sweet little French flibbertigibbet- or is she? You have to keep guessing as they go from one con to the next it is often difficult to work out who is playing who. You also never get to decide who the good guys and we even have an English police boss - or is he? Well yes he actually is English but can he trust his own men, well you are going to have to watch it to find out.As mentioned this oozes style the music is a bit of a conundrum though as it verges almost on sixties parody akin to The Pink Panther at some points which I am sure was unintentional, but it gets the care free and louche life style of these high class crooks across very nicely.It is brilliantly filmed and acted with just the right amount of Gallic self confidence that we Brits either find threatening or endearing - either way we is just jealous. Everyone seems to be effortlessly chic and they all have fab cars from Range Rovers to Convertible Minis (they are a great car I've got one and yes there are some BMW's and Bentleys, and Renaults, but Minis do rock. Enough of the cars, this is Riviera fun and there are some leaps of faith required with the plot if you stop and think. But this is one of those films that is so fast paced that you deliberately over look any plot contrivance and just let it wash over you, this is so close to being five stars really but I am awarding four purely because I am not French - only joking I ruddy loved it and so it gets the lotIn French with stylish sub titles and with a run time of an hour and a half or just over this is a film with more twists than a Chubby Checker song (well the one about twisting any way)."
"This show is not for everyone. If you don't want to see moms going over the top and children acting like brats then don't watch it.But it's not all like that. In most episodes, the parents are kind and teach the kids sportsmanship. Just like with everything else, there's a good and bad side. And there's some things that might shock as well anger some. But this is a show, like any other.What saddens me, are the reviews that the comments that are so catty and mean. It's a show. Treat it as such. If you don't like it, don't watch it, simple as that."
"I don't know which is worse -- this show or the fact that I can't stop watching it. I know it is so, so wrong on so many levels, but I don't care, 'cause it's just that good!The brilliance here is in the editing. I love how they catch a mother stating that she never would let little Desdamona Divine do pageants, but she loves it so much and constantly begs to be there. Then we cut to the child screaming, begging, crying and writhing on the floor yelling, ""No, Momma -- I don't want to do this!!"" I'm sad for the child, but cheering at how the mother is outed as a prize jerk.Another mother will go on and on about how her child can't be defeated because this or that, as the camera zeros in on her crazily enthusiastic bug-eyes and grin. And then the camera just stays focused on her face for  that extra moment too long, revealing just enough doubt and embarrassment to expose the truth of the matter.In essence, Toddlers & Tiaras is more of an expose on kiddie pageants than an exploitation, and I can't stop watching."
Loved being able to watch these &#34;crazy&#34; pageant moms again. Very glad I bought it. I want to buy every episode.
"Kings was a really great show. The acting, especially Ian McShane which is a given, was excellent. The show has good characters, that are very well developed, and an engaging and relevant plot, with twists and turns that keep you interested and thinking."
Good effects and storyline. Suspenseful images and story. This is where Chris Egan got his name. I can't imagine this was cancelled after only half of a season.
"Excellent series, which I watched on TV.  I was sorry to see it end after 13 shows.  Great cast."
To see the signs in one's life all one need do is look.  Have you seen yours today?
"At first, the dialogue was a bit jarring for me -- but I quickly adjusted and grew to appreciate its merits.This is a show with fantastic characters, and three-dimensional antagonists.  Jack is my favorite character, despite being an antagonist, and he goes through some very real and identifiable struggles.  This is incredible fiction.The series ends on an ambiguous note -- it doesn't really work as a series finale -- but this 13-hour journey is something I've watched three times from start to finish because it is such a delight."
"This is a series I found on TV by accident. Became a fan. Told two friends, they became fans, and so on. When we eagerly waiting for the new season, we would rehash the past season, making possible plot's all our own, you know, really into it. Then when the announced date came and went, we researched, what went wrong. Found out it had been cancelled.  That was my first realization that TV had become like all other business, just that. Business. So disappointed with major networks. They had managed, with Kings, to create a possible alternate future of our world, that did not involve space ships or aliens or even magic. So, watch this series, and judge for yourself, if it wasn't an excellent addition to any network line-up."
"Before I review the season, I feel the need to let potential buyers know that this season 5 is merely a compilation of the dvd sets for season 5.1 and 5.2.  Not just the discs are the same, but the actual packaging for these sets, including the covers are included as well.  Essentially this is just a large cover over the two sets previously available.  So, if you have the other sets, there's nothing knew.  Similarly, if you have 5.1, better stick with getting 5.2 when its on sale (if its still available).  However, if you don't have either, this is the way to go, even though it's a slightly clunky packaging.As to the show, it feels like a return to form in many ways.  Not that season 4 was bad, it just felt like the show was starting to show some signs of aging.  Season 5 really ups the ante, and makes the show feels fresh again, something difficult for a show five seasons in its run.  I was shocked by Michael J. Fox's performance, definitely out of character of his usual role, and rather impressive.  He provided a great foil for Dennis's character, and was very fun to watch.  I also felt the writing was stronger, giving the characters more interesting stories, and were generally speaking a lot of fun.  Overall, I recommend season 5 as a whole and recommend it to fans of the show, especially those who thought season 4 was a little more disappointing."
"My son has begun watching this series again.  He liked it a few years ago, but stopped when he was about 8.  He's almost 10, and has been revisiting them again (I forgot how much I liked them, meself xD)"
Another enjoyed season of show with granddaughter.  The adventures and Learning that are in this show are educating and dancing after are fun for granddaughter to do
"Both my sons loved it watching. Well made, good story line very appealing for the kids of 5-6 years old. good time duration"
"I can be assured that when the weird colors start hopping on the screen, my sixteen month old starts simultaneously to giggle and wiggle.  She loves these guys."
I enjoy watching the Backyardigans with my grandson.  These shows are very entertaining and he loves to sing and dance with the characters!
I dont get it but my girl loves it and its clean entertainment for young kids. She loves the &#34;whats gonna work? teamwork&#34; song which actually inspires her to work with others to get tasks done and I love that.
Great on teamwork and geography.  It's actually tolerable for viewing with children. Better than the majority of pap that's out there.
"they are polite, smart, cute, and kind...in a world filled with horror movies and violence, these guys are a nice option for the little ones."
Easy to follow and learn about all kinds of animals. My 3 year old learned &#34;teamwork&#34; from watching the wonder pets.
Wonder pets is great for young children.  It is entertaining and teaches kindness and the importance of helping others.  Also teaches children some portant facts about animals highlighted in each episode.
My daughter loves this show. I watch young kids during the day and love that they can enjoy this show and learn good healthy lessons from the show at the same time.
"I totally enjoy watching Wonder Pets with my grandson, and he loves the show! The song is catchy, and I often find myself singing it long after the show has ended. Highly recommend. Great Adventure!"
"Great messages, not overpowering in its effects and music. It is engaging and usually keeps my 4 year old entertained.  We usually watch at the end of night as a bed time treat when reading a story is not an option.Thanks Nickelodeon and Amazon for a quality show and delivery of said show,"
"Great show for my 3 year old! Keeps her entertained and happy, without anything that could be either over-stimulating or not age-appropriate. Love it!"
"What can you say, when your child love's the show.  Knows all the songs and dances. Excellent entertainment music actors"
My grandson watches Wonder Pets on my iPad and just loves this show.  He sings along with the characters and just loves animals.
"My 5 and 2 year old (and their dad and I) love the Wonder Pets!  We love their music and the cute little stories, and their adorable voices!  Very cute and fun.  And they get to learn a little about the animals and places they go on their adventures!"
"Oliva is such a fun character.  I sometimes have thought that Oliva was written about my daughter from her imagination. The nice thing is that the show is very positive and doesn't seem to have any bad influences to it, which my wife and I are always on the look out for."
Grandsons love Olivia. I (Granny) also like it. It has good teaching lessons in each episode. Recommend it for young children.
"love the books, love the shows, love the pig. kids like this one too and sometimes we put this on when we all can't agree on a show to watch."
Olivia Season 1 was great for my grandchild. He enjoyed watching it. It held his attention. He likes the characters.
Olivia is a sweet story about a very ambitious girl and her family. I love the fact she is not lazy and is not afraid to daydream then commit to action. This is great for girls or boys.
"We love Olivia, her family and her friends.  She's quite adventurous, creative, clever and funny.  100% enjoyable even watching for the tenth time."
"Olivia is bright, cheerful, witty and smart! She has entertained my grandchildren in every episode presented. I especially like the one where she has lost her favorite tights as they are supposed to give her good luck. In the end everything comes together and she finds her tights. She deals with the issues and resolves them. Good clean, wholesome entertainment!"
My boys love this show. my 3 year old loves the scrapes she gets into and my 2 year old is fascinated by the little bother and the little brother.  This series can keep them quietly entertained for hours.
We love Olivia. She has such a way about her and it's fun to see how her imagination works. &#128522;
My son and daughter both love Olivia and hum the theme song all the time. Lots of fun for the whole family...
I love the imagination and creativity Olivia has.  My 3 year old daughter has a very creative imagination and finds a kindred spirit in this character
"Five stars because my granddaughter asked for my iPad, selected Amazon Instant Video App, and searched for Olivia! In four days she watched at least three times! So, the five stars are from my observation. I will now have to watch Olivia because she likes it so much."
"Olivia is one of the favorites of my granddaughter.  She enjoys the interactions between her and her brother, as well as laughs a lot with their cat's involvement.  It is a very good family cartoon for your toddler because it depicts family dynamics and ways to solve any problems that Olivia may encounter.  A good buy."
Such a fun show for the kids to watch. It keeps them entertained and teaches them a few things too!
"Olivia, in book and video form, is a favorite with the three little grandgirls. It is an intelligent cartoon with a message that is just subtle enough to be amusing. Even for an adult, Olivia is watchable. Two of these stories gave us just enough time to prepare dinner."
Perfect for ages 4 and up. My 5 year old daughter loves it! Very good-natured and funny without being dumbed down or too flashy. I also don't feel like they're trying to sell anything.
"Better Off Ted is outrageously funny. Great acting, witty banter, crazy ideas, and not-too-far-fetched corporate scenarios make this a very entertaining series to watch."
"This show was absolutely fantastic - sharp, sarcastic, and funny. It mocked the absurdities of the office culture, employers' complete disregard of the well-being of employees, and a vast gap between the management and the 'drones.' I am mystified why it was cancelled after only two seasons, but am also glad that I did not get to see its decline - which reminds me of 'Common Law' - another great but prematurely cancelled comedy show. I'm happy to own it ; I re-watched some episodes many times. Oh, and those Veridian Dynamics 'ads' are a strike of pure genius!"
i just can't believe they cancelled this show.  it was so groundbreaking and funny.  every episode was new and original.  the writers should win awards.
Great show sad to see it get cancelled. Networks nowadays don't take enough risk or time to get a show on track.
Funniest show on TV Portia de Rossi is outstanding and I LOVE Phil and Lem!
"A fabulous show that was cancelled far too early. For those who haven't watched it, the show is a satirical situation comedy that focuses on a fictional multi-national corporation called 'Veridian Dynamics'. The main character, Ted, is the head of research and development and oversees a quirky team of scientists and product testers. I love the humor and the relationships between the characters. Portia de Rossi is perfectly cast as the emotionless member of management. The 'commercials' for Veridian Dynamics are hysterical. I highly recommend this show!"
"this show is hysterical. i have only seen half of the first season, and i can't stop laughing, and i do mean hysterically. i can only say this, and i'm sorry if this offends, but if you are a BIG fan of, ARE YOU BEING SERVED, this is the show for you.  While it isn't that fabulous British sitcm, it is a fabulous American sitcom which has the same elements of, ARE YOU BEING SERVED. i am not going to write a thesis, here, but i can say that, BETTER OFF TED, shares the same sense of hilarity, the same kinds of lovable characters, and the kind of memorable scenes that makes one laugh to one's self, long after the show is off (there are scenes from ARE YOU BEING SERVED which still cause me to erupt in laughter).i can't recommend BETTER OFF TED to the fans of ARE YOU BEING SERVED, enough, save to say that this is the worthy successor, and that it is too bad that BETTER OFF TED lasted only two seasons.\by-the-way, PARKS AND RECREATION is good, very good, )i am a fan) but, where PARKS and RECREATION is laugh out loud, funny, BETTER OFF TED is hilarious. There is a difference."
Laughed hard every episode.  Has to be seen to be believed. This is the final proof that Portia is much funnier than her wife.
"I really enjoyed this show.  Very funny and quick.  Wish that it had lasted beyond two seasons, especially given the sorry state of American television."
"I normally don't watch television during the week, so this was one of those shows I meant to watch, but never did.  What a shame, because it's actually very funny.  I like all the characters, even Veronica.  Everyone does a wonderful job in this one, and it's a shame that it didn't last."
A show that makes it hard to breath!  Watch it more than once to catch the jokes you laughed through the first time.  Such a shame that this very funny show didn't last longer--but well worth watching what was made.
It's a shame that ABC dumped such a fabulous show it's hilarious it's intelligent writing. The acting is stellar so it's great!!!
I expected this one set to be a winner and it did not disappoint.  All the great characters and a positive story line each time
"Wonderful music, educational about animals and the kids (and parents) get to learn Spanish as they are entertained. Consistency, repetition and catchy tunes all help to make this a very interactive show. My toddler especially loves learning the names of new animals that Diego, Alecia and Baby Jaguar help to rescue."
My 3 yr old loves this show! I like that it is not only entertaining but educational as well. My son can tell me so much about animals it is amazing.
Entertaining and educational. My granddaughter loves Diego. We recommend. It seems to capture and keep her attention. Hope you and your kids love it as well.
"Educational, cute and the kids enjoy it. Also like the multi language approach to get my kids learning! Very cute show!"
"Kids, love it, kept them occupied and interested the entire show. They were singing and laughing. Full of movement and sound. Great."
"The Funniest Season after Season 12 So Far, I can't wait for it to come out,I have seen all of this Season's Episodes! and I have Last Season. Family Guy has nothing on this Show. My favorite Episode of the Whole season is WTF and butter's bottom ..... but they are all Good and funny."
"I've watched this show since it began when I was a fourth grader and it's weird to watch the boys have only grown one grade while I'm now four years out of high school. Season 13 of the show manages to continue the series longer than most animated shows still without killing what the show itself is meant to be, for the most part. This season if not all out great like I feel seasons 6,8 or 11 were is at least another solid season with stand out episodes. While the show did take a few more unscheduled trips to the silly end of things they still manage to be enjoyable for true fans and it hardly feels the show is selling out or risking becoming a satire of itself. Episodes this season are:The Ring - When the Jonas brothers make Kenny's new girlfriend hot he starts wearing a promise ring like them only to become boring and a shell of his former self. [I'm in favor of anything that mocks the Jonas Brothers. I hate them so much]The Coon - During times of great Woe and Despair, ""The Coon"" rises up from the gutter to defend the city. Cartmen is the city's sole savior until Mysterion arrives on the scene and he must team with Professor Chaos to unmask the new hero. [This was an entertaining stab at more recent super hero movies Dark Knight and Watchmen. If nothing else we get to see Professor Chaos again and the scenes with the stupid cops are great. I'm also surprised how few people were upset by the subtle allusion to Obama in this episode and it's controversial title]Margaritaville - While the town fights over who to blame for the poor economy, Randy steps forward with a plan to live without an economy at all. Soon the town returns to biblical times and only a Jew willing to pay for our sins can save us. Meanwhile in trying to return his father's unneeded margarita maker, Stan symbolically explores the actual problem with the economy. [A great episode with a classic South Park premise, Emmy Winner]Eat, Pray, Queef - An April Fool's Day joke gone wrong finds America's women and two Canadian women much like Terrence and Phillip standing up for their right to 'fart' like men do, despite how truly disgusting the men find it. [Definitely not one of the best episodes but definitely a fun joke at the root of it and it perfectly reflects part of the male mind. Would have been better with less Terrence and Phillip, though it was nice to see them again and the recurring references to Matt & Trey's April Fool's Day joke gone wrong in '98 are always ammusing self relevance]Fishsticks - When Jimmy comes up with a great new joke about fishsticks Cartmen tries to take credit and then so does comedian Carlos Mencia. Meanwhile Kanye West doesn't get the joke and winds up becoming the joke himself. [A great episode considering it's centered on such a simple joke and manages to attack so many people so well. Do you like fishsticks? Then you must be a gay fish.]Pinewood Derby - When Randy lies to help Stan win the Pinewood Derby it results in him teaching his son how to cover up a lie only for things to obviously escalate to ridiculous levels. [A fun episode that takes a good shot at recent politics and the absurd lengths people will go to try and cover up something that's already obvious to the rest of us.]Fatbeard - Cartmen decides to become a pirate and drags Butters and a rag tag crew along only to wind up being unknowingly kidnapped by real Somalian Pirates. While Cartmen lives the life of a fairy tale pirate, the US tries to get them out of the hostage situation.[Finally another episode hitting directly on what was happening in the news that week. Very funny visuals and it wonderfully comments on the events. If not a truly great episode, it's good.]Dead Celebrities - When Ike is being haunted by the presence of dead celebrities the boys call in the ghost hunters only to realize they only scare themselves by bumping into things in the dark. Soon the boys learn the numerous recent dead celebrities wont't move on because one refuses to accept his death and possesses Ike, leading to a hilarious scene that mocks the perversion of toddler beauty pagents. [This episode made me think there could be a new era of South Park episodes. Amazing in it's execution, mocking several things well and again based right on the headlines with deeper meanings to be found in the humor. Genius.]Butter's Bottom Bitch - Butters first kiss from a girl finds him realizing why boys would pay for kisses. When he tries to start a kissing ring it escalates, unbeknownst to him, to a prostitution ring. Soon a dedicated cop is trying to take down Butters who has transformed into a P.I.M.P. [A funny topic I'm surprised they haven't commented on more before. Player's Ball scenes were great and an enjoyable episode with lots of laughs]W.T.F. - After going to a wrestling event the boys all want to become wrestlers. When they learn what real wrestling is on the school team they opt out to form their own wrestling arena where their over the top acting is so good Vince MCMahon stops by to possibly recruit them. [Amazing in how it completely properly comments on what Wrestling has become and ties in the ""Took our job"" guys taking there bit to a new extreme and gives us the new hilarious character of the school wrestling teacher who everyone thinks is gay. A personal favorite.]Whale Whores - When Stan's birthday trip to the Aquarium is ruined by Japanese Dolphin killer's he sets out to stop them and make a difference in the world. He crosses paths with several Discovery Channel reality shows before realizing they don't actually do anything. In the end we see why the Japanese hate Dolphins and Whales so much. [Excellent beginning in how it mocks several things. It looses some steam but the final joke is amusing and the episode as a whole is fun. Especially the turnaround on the Japanese being thought cruel for slaughtering dolphins and whales but America will accept them slaughtering cows because that's normal]The F Word - When the boys use the f word (ends in an ag) to describe some attention seeking Harley rider's everyone gets upset. The Harley rider's explore the origin of the word while the boys fight to explain their meaning of the word versus the meaning the adults have. [Some didn't like this episode. I have argued the point it makes for years. The definition of words is always changing and I agree that the F word now means the definition given at the end of this episode, or at least loud annoying people who crave attention]Dances With Smurfs - When Cartmen takes over the announcements at school he becomes like many recent supposed journalists who just use free speech as an excuse to package their opinion as fact. Soon he is targeting class president Wendy and accusing her of elaborately made up lies.[A fun episode that takes good shots at Avatar, the recent so called journalists and the very recent headlines of a politician who actually claimed to have run off to the mountains]Pee - When the boys go to a water park Kyle is bothered by the discovery that everyone, including Stan, pees in the pools. Cartmen is disillusioned by the abundance of minorities. Then when the pool PH levels are nearly all P and no H disaster strikes leaving Kyle to face his fear of urine and Cartmen believing he is the last white man alive. [If not a great season finale it does mock the stupidity of 2012, has a good running bit for Kyle and has the hilarious story of Cartmen believing he has become the world's last majority surrounded by minorities and singing an awesome song about it while making a true statement about America]This season set (Available in 3 disc DVD or 2 disc Blu-Ray) contains the same mini commentaries included on each season set since the third season. Nowadays Matt and Trey have caught up with themselves and are commenting on episodes right after (and in some cases before) they've finished making them. I personally found this set's mini-com's to be very entertaining and funny. This is also the first season to contain deleted scenes, which unlike most shows, are actually entertaining stuff that just had to be cut for time. Another interesting special feaure for true South Park fans is an XBOX Live segment giving fans a look inside South Park studios.Also included is some sort of X-Box cross promotion for a game called, South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play! XLBA, that will give purchasers of this DVD or Blu-Ray a free character and two unlockable levels, whatever that means.All in all I continue to commend South Park for avoiding satirizing itself like other favorites the Simpsons, or even Family Guy. This show is always just about pointing out how stupid things are and as long as they never take that too serial then they will always have good episodes if not great ones. It's hard to expect them to come up with constant simplistically genius episode concepts like Guitar Queer-o, Make Love Not Warcraft, Good Times With Weapons or Imaginationland on a nonstop basis. So a mere good season is forgiven as long as it contains great episodes which this one does. Five Stars for being as Funny and certainly as Entertaining as Ever.*After having now rewatched the episodes, this season stands up much better in second viewing. I would now say it's much better than just good, though still not truly great."
This was a gift for our adult son who has been a South Park fan ever since it began.  It was on his list so he knew what it would be and was very happy to receive it.
"The 13th season lacked a lot of the good biting satire and social commentary of previous seasons. The pee humor was rather disgusting as I prefer intellectual humor. To that end, the last episode made the whole season a worthwhile purchase ($15.00 Walmart, which had seasons 1-13 to my surprise). In Dances with Smurfs, Cartman, plays a Glenn Beck character doing the morning announcements (the kid who was doing the announcements was killed in a case of mistaken identity.) Cartman hounds Wendy, the school president, and blames her for every wrong at the school."
"The kids love this show, eager to watch again and again.  I've watched alongside them, and it's easy to get caught up in this tale of mermaids living on land.  They manage to mingle daily life with a magical world without being inappropriate.  Girls always love mermaids, and let's face it, don't you get tired of the Disney stuff?  This show, is free of all the canned laughter, corny old jokes, product placement, agendas and hidden messages that Disney (and most American TV) puts in all the kids shows nowadays.  It's nice to see a show the kids can just enjoy, learning gentle lessons about right and wrong, friendship and so on."
Nice middle school or young teen series.
"H2O reminded me of Flipper and Gidget from the 1960s.  The plots ran to sibling rivalry, fights with each other and boyfriends, misunderstandings, embarrassments, and the joy of swimming and playing in the water. Must see for teens who like fantasy, The scenery is beautiful.  The costumes superb.  Some of the special effects are silly, but easily overlooked."
Well produced series for teen girls and their moms.  Not disrespectful to elders or other kids.  Just a lot of fun.
"My daughter is seven and loves the show she's watched it 15 to 20 times over.  Has good characters, good storylines and good lessons to learn."
"our daughter found out about it from a friend and watched every show before school this year...a fun idea, not as disneylike."
I would recommend this video for children and teens. I am adult and I enjoyed this tremendously. It was refreshing. No sex or profanity included.
I love mermaids! It was good to find a TV show featuring them.  The stories are good and the water scenes are beautiful.
I thought this would be another teen age brainless romp. Despite being far from a teenager I began enjoying it and was ready for the next episode when the one I was watching ended.
"The girls watched this repeatedly and absolutely love this show. I have sat through some episodes and it is enjoyable, keep in mind this show is better suited for girls. It's set in Australia and plenty of beach and ocean scenes, if you have girls they will love this show as mine have."
"My daughter loves stories about mermaids, and when I saw that this Australian-made TV show, H20, centered around three teenage girls who are able to transform into mermaids, I thought it was worth checking out. I am glad I did because my soon to be nine-year-old daughter absolutely adores this series! I made it a point to watch it with her to make sure the series had nothing objectionable in terms of content or language but I needn't have worried. This is a wholesome, family-friendly show that explores mainly problems of friendship and relationships at a level that is appropriate for its target audience of girls ages 7-13.In Season 1, three girls, Ricki Chadwick (Cariba Heine), Emma Gilbert (Claire Holt), and Cleo Sertori (Phoebe Tonkin who went on to star in the short-lived American witch-themed series,The Secret Circle ) play sixteen-year-old girls who get stranded on Mako Island, a strange and mysterious place. The night they are stranded on the island, a full moon passes over the girls while they are in a pool on the island, and when they eventually get rescued and return home, they find that they have the ability to turn into mermaids when they come into contact with water! The girls also find they have some supernatural powers: Rikki has the ability to control heat in water, Emma has the ability to freeze water, and Cleo is able to mold water. Over the course of the show, the girls develop their powers, aided by Cleo's childhood friend turned boyfriend, Lewis (Angus McLaren).Each episode runs about 24 minutes. The themes usually center on how the three girls struggle to keep their secret, and of how the secret places a strain on their relationships with others and their friendship. There is some kissing, but nothing over the top that would make this unsuitable for the target age-group. I make it a point to watch the episodes with my daughter, and we have a fun time discussing the plot and issues covered. It is an engaging and fun series for tween girls!"
"I love this show so much, I ordered the DVDs of all 3seasons on amazon."
"Season 2 was as enjoyable as season 1.  I liked that the issues changed and matured with the teens. H2O reminded me of Flipper and Gidget from the 1960s.  The plots ran to sibling rivalry, fights with each other and boyfriends, misunderstandings, embarrassments, and the joy of swimming and playing in the water. Must see for teens who like fantasy, The scenery is beautiful.  The costumes superb.  Some of the special effects are silly, but easily overlooked."
The kids love it. Good tv like I remember it as a kid. As a parent it's not tough to watch with them either.
I have really gotten fond of all these Australian TV series !! Can't stop watching this one ! If you like teens ... you will like this series :-)
My daughter can't get enough of H2O. She loves the show an it is family friendly. It seems to keep her attention and I don't have to monitor it for bad issues.
But they missed the boat now making into seasion DVD for USA > Its only on PAL. I want ot buy the DVD season not individual episodes
Season number 2 just as delightful to watch as the first.  Just the right amount of suspense to get to keep coming back.

In the second season, a girl named Charlotte comes between Cleo and Lewis, testing the pair's friendship and relationship to the limit. There are also some interesting twists in the second season involving Charlotte discovering something about her grandmother that could have repercussions on the trio of mermaids. There are plenty of suspenseful moments here. In terms of content, the language is clean and even though there are some kissing scenes, they are very mild in comparison to other teen-themed shows, which makes this show appropriate for the target age-group.

think of this as a alien and zombie movie in one.  loads of action and adventure.  with this 2 disk set there is not a whole lot of features to the movie one of them is at comic con with stars from the movie there.
"My only regret was that I did not see this at the theater.  The graphics, gothic modernity of the landscape, acting, and storyline are excellent.  Sure, they are on a mission, but hold on to your seat before you even start down that road.  Can't wait for the next installment of this series."
"I first saw this movie on SYFY and my smaller screen tv... it looks much more impressive on the 50inch High Def screen... lots more detail in Blu-Ray that I missed before. Thomas Jane either plays this perfectly or this part was written for him. And you can NEVER go wrong with either Ron Perlman or John Malkovich... and in this film you get them both! I was equally impressed with the supporting cast... and even though there are really only 8 or so different actors playing the mutants, you won't really care, cause there's so much action going on! This film vaunts really high ideals and personal sacrifices in the face of impossible odds, all in order to save the planet... can't get much more apple pie than that! I love this film!"
"I didn't like Parks and Rec at first. It wasn't until the second season that i felt like it all gelled and took off. However going back and watching the first season I appreciate it as an introduction to Pawnee, Ron Swanson, Leslie Knopfe, etc.  It is great to watch this season and see how they've developed and evolved from it.  Definitely a good purchase if you, like me, love this show.Also they have great extras and extended producers cuts of episodes. Definitely worth the buy"
"Just a great, off the wall, very well written comedy.  You get interested and invested in the characters and the show just continues to get better as you get to know everyone better and better."
"My partner is a Political Science Professor and watching Parks & Recreation with her has been wonderful to help understand some of the little innuendo that comes with understanding a comedy dealing with local government.  There are some issues that are so politically incorrect that you'll just have to laugh.  I've loved this series and have them DVR'ed and watch them over and over.  I look forward to the actual release of the DVD (which I have pre-ordered) so that I can watch the episodes without commercial interruption.The characters are extremely funny and stereotypical to what you might imagine a government worker to be like.  Lines like:""What I can accomplish in government can actually be measured"" (after one of the characters is commended for lowering a speed bump two inches).The humor can be dry at times (love it) and it brings out a wonderful side of Amy Poehler[...]A mockumentary series at it's best!"
"If you are looking to watch a show to be entertained, this is the show for you. We are always guaranteed a good laugh when watching this show."
"Parks and Recreation is one of the funniest and positive T.V. shows that you can currently find. The acting is fantastic and each episode/sketch is light-hearted. As an office fan this was a certain change of pace, but one that I found myself to enjoy immensely. I recommend sticking with this show to season 2, although I can almost guarantee you will be hooked mid-way through the first season. If you are not an Amazon Prime Member and you are looking to rent this show (perhaps through a T.V. pass), I would recommend checking out Amazon Prime, as seasons 1-4 are available with the service in HD. Watch this show!!!"
"Good Dick has a very off-putting title but at the heart of this dark comedy, lies a beautiful and complexed story. Jason Ritter is absolute perfection in this film! He holds this film together. I loved all the different layers of his character and the troubled woman he falls in love with. The two characters are given no name which I didn't even noticed until the credits rolled at the end! The 'man' tries to help the 'woman' out of her isolated existence, come to terms with her horrible past, and learn to love again. Good Dick is a strange but intriguing love story, definitely worth buying! Enjoy."
"If you're tired of the Hollywood fake romantic comedies where two people meet and instantly fall in ""love"" then try the real thing. Two very decent people meet and build real intimacy, real caring and yes, real love in a very real way---and we get to see it all. It's moving, it's funny, it's real and the many laughs will leave your eyes filled with tears. Remember the buddy scenes in the store in High Fidelity? They're here too, only much better here. What will blow you away will be the honesty and freshness here. If you love romance, real romance, try this. Not for the kiddies or to watch with grandma."
"I was interested in every aspect, from the dynamics of the guys' relationships with each other in the video store to the relationship between the main characters.  **SPOILERS AS TO GENERAL THEMES FOLLOW**  Reminded me a little bit ofLast Tango in Paris(with a more realistic ending), andThe Piano, though more straight-forward, less convoluted, less artsy.  People characterize this as a ""little movie"", and I guess it is, but nevertheless, brilliant- the script, the direction, the acting.  ""Good Dick"" indeed.I have a soft spot for stories about how square pegs and round holes come together, in mutual need, and ultimate...generosity (reminds me of another favorite movie in that respect,Hoffman) .  Far-fetched?  Not at all.  A bit of queerness (""queer"" as it's currently used, to connote sex role fluidity/ gender-bending), but it's a layer to be peeled away, to reveal...?  I would love to talk about what I saw as a major shift in the woman's perspective (and a turning point in the film) as she realizes something quite profound about the man, but I can't without ruining the moment, so I won't.Ritter is John Ritter's son, and his mother, Nancy Morgan, has a cameo in the film as a waitress.  Jason Ritter was simply WONDERFUL, Marianna Palka too (as both actress and director- her direction was spare, understated, unsentimental, just like her acting).  Tom Arnold did a great job too.  The feelings snuck up on me, didn't see them coming, I LOVE when that happens.  Great ending.  Loved it period!"
"The crazy, absurd police officers of the Reno sheriff's department return for more wild antics in season six of Reno 911!, Comedy Central's popular mockumentary-style parody of law enforcement documentary shows, most specifically COPS. In this show, comic actors play the police officers and engage in a series of improvised (and absolutely absurd) sketches using a broad outline and minimally scripted material. The cops aren't real. The situations aren't real... but the laughs are definitely real.At the beginning of season six, viewers are introduced to two new characters: Deputy Frank Rizzo (Joe Lo Truglio) and Sergeant Jack Declan (Ian Roberts), who were brought in to pick up the empty spots left by Deputy Sergeant Class II Clementine ""Clemmie"" Johnson (Wendi McLendon-Covey) and Deputy Cherisha Kimball (Mary Birdsong) after they were (supposedly) killed in the massive explosion at the end of season five. While it's easy to miss the fallen deputies, Frank and Jack are acceptable replacements who help inject new life into an aging series.Rizzo and Declan are quickly inducted into the wacky, everyday occurrences in the lives of the Reno sheriff's department. From roller-skating prostitutes and serial killers to awkward dinner parties with exes and a ""stoner Jesus,"" Reno's finest continue their eccentric adventures while refusing to shy away from ""unacceptable"" topics.As in previous seasons, the all of the characters are brought to vivid, zany life by a funny funny cast with some of the best improvisation talent on television. Lieutenant Jim Dangle (Thomas Lennon) is particularly notable as the in-the-closet head of the Reno sheriff's department. This season also features guest appearances by Rachel Harris, Scott Thompson, George Lopez, and others.This DVD set includes all 15 episodes of season six in their complete, politically incorrect and uncensored versions. The set also includes a collection of alternate and deleted scenes, hilarious extended outtakes, in-depth audio commentary from the cast members, and two profiles that introduce newcomers Deputy Frank Rizzo (Truglio) and Sergeant Jack Declan (Roberts).While much of the humor here is highly juvenile and politically incorrect, it will send viewers rolling with their sides splitting open. Some sketches are incredibly dumb, while others will leave viewers cringing or even make viewers wonder why on earth they are laughing at something so indecent or inappropriate. Reno 911! is filled with the kind of humor that will offend any and every group on the face of the planet, make proponents of politically correct humor cry, and those with weak constitutions lose their lunches.For viewers who can get past all of that, this series is absolutely hilarious. It hits nearly every taboo subject right on the head -- ranging from cultural slurs and stereotypes to highly adult content. While not every sketch is packed with laughs, each episode leaves something funny with viewers and will make them hungry for more Reno."
"Season 6 arrived in the midst of much outrage over the departures of Mary Birdsong (""Deputy Cherisha Kimball""), Wendi McLendon-Covey (""Deputy Clementine ""Clemmie"" Johnson), and Carlos Alazraqui (""Deputy James Garcia"").But let's get real for a minute. Each of these characters represented one-note solos, much like Neil Young's ""Cinnamon Girl,"" but in a much less effective way.Kimball: ""Is she or isn't she?"" If you're like me, you stopped caring.Johnson: ""Round round get around I get around""...yes, Deputy Johnson got around, and the joke grew a long, gray beard.Garcia: Set-up for low-rent Hispanic jokes. 'nuff said.We still have Dangle, Travis Junior, Wiegel, and Jones...the core of the ensemble...and that's close enough for rock and roll. We also have ""former sex slave Cindy""...the wonderful and gorgeous Wanru Tseng...so while the glory days of the series may be in the past, having the show around for another season is nothing to sneeze at. ESPECIALLY when the season opens with Dangle proclaiming ""I thought we were canceled!""Reno 911 is an acquired taste. I thought the movie really missed the mark, and was the only true failure so far. Season 6 won't displace the prior 5 seasons as ""best season ever"" by ANY means, but if you are a fan of those seasons, it is ""glass half empty, glass half full"" time.I was personally grateful to have 15 new episodes of one of the most irreverent TV series of all time."
"I was skeptical about this season when I found out Clemmy, Garcia, and Kimball were killed off.  I thought Clemmy was hilarious as well as Garcia with his red hot temper (plus I think he's hot).  I even liked Kimball, especially with her religious fundamentalism and the possible romance with cousin Travis Junior.  Well, I was surprised how well I liked the new characters: Sgt. Jack Declan the tough, angry fat guy (although he has, according to the commentaries, since lost a lot of weight) and the exuberant New Yorker Dep. Frank Rizzo who is also really cute.  They fit into the department right from the first episode.  I also like the quasi romantic connection between Wiegel and Rizzo.  I've just heard from the cyberspace grapevine that this is the last season so, unfortunately, that storyline won't be further developed.  Reoccurring sketches include the Mexican radio station, high school metal detector, the white trash gal Carmen, senior abuse public service announcements, the mental hospital, the lonely ranger, the library, classroom presentations, the sexy car wash, the guy with the boat (I don't care for those skits), Cindy the ex-sex slave turned dispatcher, and Terry the roller skater.  Other sketches are listed below along with what I consider highlights.Disc 1:1. Dangle mentions in passing a couple times that two deputies were blown up last season (what about the third?).  Trudy introduces the ""Suicide Prevention Webpage.""  Frank Rizzo gives some background on his well-traveled law enforcement career.  Rizzo becomes Jones's partner and schools him on how to complete a drug bust.  Williams and Dangle escort an employee from his workplace.  Sgt. Declan visits his informant Terry.  Highlight:  the KKK winery.2. Doll trouble.  Air Overnight delivers ""presents"" from ""Joe Public.""  Williams and Wiegel give makeovers at the high school metal detector.  Dangle and Rizzo conduct surgery.  Highlight:  Patton Oswalt guest stars as a man confessing to a crime for a trip to Tailand which leads to a hilarious airplane scene.  The commentary talks about the special effects and how much that doll costs.3. The department holds their meetings at Capt. Crabby's Crab Shack because of the asbestos at the station (why would they be eating seafood so early in the morning?).  A convicted murderer leads Dangle and Williams to a buried victim.  The dept. keeps a blind man in the restaurant and pretend its a jail by yelling lines like a 1930s African American family.  Highlight:  Wiegel and Rizzo commandeer a tour bus.  Rizzo tells the group he once had a 300 game at a bowling alley they passed.  The commentary has Thomas Lennon and Niecy Nash talking about Raineesha's booty.4. One of my favorite episodes.  Dangle hosts a murder mystery dinner.  Among the guests are Dangle's ex-wife, her other ex-husband and current fiancee (played by ""Kids in the Hall"" comedian Scott Thompson).  She obviously likes guys a little on the peculiar side. Williams plays a mammy and Trudy is supposed to be the victim--things do not work out that way, however.5. Conclusion of the murder mystery where all sorts of gossip comes out about the guests.  Highlight:  Terry is accused of trying on fruit at the produce section of the Piggly Wiggly.6.  A team from the Vatican comes to Reno to determine if the city is worthy of a visit by the pope and the department does whatever it can to discourage the visit.7.  Old videos showing the department back in the day is shown.  Highlight:  Trudy sings a song about blocking bad words on the library search engine (brought tears to my eyes), Jones running out of a meth lab screaming when he is shot at.Disc 2:8. Rizzo harasses a soccer coach to get his kid more playing time.  Junior and Dangle help Mayor Hernandez with a scandal involving a hooker and a drive through. Commentary by Ian Roberts and Joe Lo Truglio.9.  Rizzo and Wiegel are trapped in a moving motor home and love is in the air.  Highlights:  Mario the cute little witness protection dog.  Trudy talking at the end of the episode about what went on in the trailer.  That brought tears to my eyes.  Commentary by Joe Lo Truglio and Kerry Kenny-Silver.10. Dangle's 10-year tribute to the death of Princess Diana is ready for showtime, much to the chagrin of the department.  Wiegel's video will is shown.  Highlight:  Jesus Christ Superstar party.11. The department hires Levon French of the popular Linoleum City commercials to film a recruitment video.  The commentary reveals a real life run-in with the Sparks police.12. Sgt. Declan passes his anger management course, though you wouldn't know it.  Williams and Wiegel try to clean up gang graffiti and get shot at. Junior and Declan are after unlicensed merchandise of Nickelodeon characters.  Rizzo helps a family whose brakes have failed.  Commentary: Robert Ben Garant and Ian Roberts talk about eating scenes and other things.13.  The department fires the ashes of Garcia out of a cannon.  Jones and Wiegel try to bust a swinger party--Jones's outfit is outrageous.

"Takes police procedurals, urban criminalily and dramatic detective work to new heights in a believable, heart-pounding and fast moving series. Gives viewers a good mix of humor, gangsterism, revenge and human nature that is rarely equalled by most TV shows of this type. I understand that this series was cancelled prematurely and that certainly seems to be the case.  My only quibbles would be the jerky hand held camera and the dimly lit/hard to see night time and indoor scenes."
"While I think that the final episode was perhaps a bit overdone, I really enjoyed this entire season. The first episode drew me in and I just couldn't stop watching. In fact, I finished the entire season that same afternoon!"
"Southland & Homicide have alot in common as far as Deep edgy Cop Dramas That take a Much more realistic look behind The men and womanThat put there lives on the Line to Serve & ProtectBoth Shows have An Amazing ensemble cast  (Perfect Casting!!!!!!!!)Both Shows Introduced viewers through the eyes of the Rookie CopWith Homicide  Det. Tim Bayliss  played Perfectly by Kyle Secorand Southland  Officer Ben Sherman played equally Great  by Ben McKenzieEnough of me Geeking out over Great Top Notch Cop ShowsDespite all the Positive reviews from both Critics and TV Viewers The Show was Canceled due to the NBC Late Night Re-ToolingJay Leno in Prime Time (Boy, that was such a Great Idea!?!?!)But, out of Nowhere TNT Bought the Show  Thank GodSouthland never seem to fit on Network tv (It was To Dark and Raw)The original broadcast on  NBC was Butchered..........With TNT alot less bleeps But, Now with the Season One Box Set it's UNCUTHopefully if it sells enough Units it will get a BR TransferBelieve the Hype and all the Critics10/10"
"i can watch this show forever, but will the rest come out in dvd/bluray soon? at all?police language is totally correct also!"
"Tough, unvarnished, complicated, and that's just the Cops when they're NOT at work! This is an awesome show and how a Cop show should be done--like The Shield--complicated people doing an unbeliveable job that most of us wouldn't do, getting shot at and crapped on emotionally by the public . The best character by far is Michael Cudlitz (""Bull"" from Band of Brothers)the street Cop who has seen too much, done too much, has no life apart from his job and is spiraling out of control in his personal life. This guy has nailed every role he's had since 'BoB', he is great in my opinion. Regina King is also wonderful as the tough detective with a 'do nothing' partner played by Tom Everet Scott. The stories are really well done and I immediately bought season II half way thru watching this. If you are a fan of The Wire, Law & Order, you will love this show I guarantee it."
I didn't watch this on tv when it first came out. So I had the joy of gorging on a whole season at once.  This was my bedtime tv for weeks.  I like it.
I am a fanof this police series.  It is one of the best I have ever seen with it real life portrayl of police officer and criminals.Excellent viewing.
Best cop show since &#34;Police Story&#34; complex characters acted by a great ensemble cast. A real shame TNT cancelled it. Ann Biderman the shows creator is terrific. Fortunately her new show &#34;Ray Donovan &#34; on ShowtimeContinues to show she has great stories to tell
"NBC or whoever had it and let it go made a major mistake. Buy the seasons you can, you won't be sorry."
Purchased the first episode of the first season not knowing what to expect.  Ended up purchasing all 5 seasons as we enjoyed each episode of each season.  See my reviews on the other seasons to help you decide if the show is worth purchasing.  Enjoy!
I don't understand why the network decided to dump this series.  I found it interesting and humorous.  The probably dumped it to keep up with the other networks' stupid programming qualities.  TV is deteriorating  a little more every year.  Hard to find anything really good on TV anymore.
"We found this because I love Jeremy Renner and was looking for what else he has done.  He's great here and I was happily surprised with the quality of the rest of the cast. This is both funny and touching and quirky and weird enough but not too twee...  Actually,  it's charming.  It's a charming series about quirky cops going through their days.  I'm so sorry it wasn't continued but these few episodes are gems.And I have to plug Amazon prime here,  through it we get access to amazing shows that we would not watch otherwise.  It's terrific value!  So it's a win/win!"
i've watched about five episodes and have enjoyed each. the stories and actors are ideal in their place. i view them on my kindle and reach for it when normal tv fare is less than worth the time.
Loved the show and its quirkiness.  Too bad it didn't last long. I guess the lead actor was too busy doing &#34;The Avengers&#34; movie. ...
Really well developed characters.Funny.Intelligently written.Excellent cross-genre blend of comedy and cop shop.This is another one of those great shows that makes you wonder what is going through programming executives minds when they cancel shows like this.
I really thought this was great.  It was Unusual that I like a cop show.EXCELLENT!!  why oh why did it stop.
"If The Hurt Locker, starring J. Remmer, had come out just a couple of weeks earlier, this series probably would been continued.  But, he's probably become too famous and in demand now to do a TV series again.  Too bad, I would have looked forward to another season of this show.  Very enjoyable with a great cast."
"The characters were fun and had their various flaws. I hate that this show was cancelled before the writers could explore the flaws. Although the show seemed written around Renner/Tamblyn as the primary cop-couple, each cop-couple seemed pretty interesting and there was a lot to explore in their various relationships.In the end, I think my favorite character was going to be the recurring character of Marvin. The two episodes that he was in were fun and he was great as a sympathetic criminal. Too bad this show didn't get a chance to develop. Dumb decision makers!"
This series was a great show/series!  I find it hard to believe it got cancelled after only 1 season.  It was not shown or promoted because it is much better than shows that have made it for years.  The humor is fabulous...very similar to the M.A.S. H. television series.  The major networks all want criminal minds and csi type shows...we loose  with this all the same philosophy.  I wish they would make more seasons to THE UNUSUALS!  Maybe Netflix or Amazon will make their own series of this show!
Exciting and great rapport between Jeremy and Amber. This series was on TV for only a year which was a shame because it was well done.
This also is only one season but it's a very delightful series. The humor was funny. You should see it.
"I am so disappointed with television. A show like this with so many options with the characters, story lines and they just stop it.Very sad that there wasn't another season to see where things opened up more, but I am so happy I found at least this tid-bit of entertainment."
Too bad this did not last. Everyone needs to keep up with these surveys so that maybe we can keep shows like this from going away
"So I don't own a TV anymore, just a computer and I never seem to be able to watch any TV series because they are as a rule, night time soaps, flat and way too predictable, I would prefer sitting in a dentist office. I am an actor, director and writer so in an effort to stay current I try watching what is out there albeit here on Amazon. Like flicking through a magazine to see if there is anything worth reading I jump from show to show in hopes of finding there are people out there doing quality work. Surviving multiple seasons should be an indicator of quality at some level...not always the case, ok seldom the case these days. The unusual thing about the Unusuals is how good it is...or was and it only lasted one season! With Great dynamics on all levels from the cast to the script the highs and lows, laughter and tears, emotions, bounce back and forth but never lose continuity. The writing, casting and direction couldn't have been better, that likely accounts for the acting by every actor that season from the stars to the co-stars and guest was sublime. So if you ever want to make a great TV show or film, Get this team back together again, done deal! I don't know why The Unusuals didn't have legs, but I never watched it before because of the promotional aspects, the opening music and graphics are dated, a cross between Mission Impossible and Get Smart, and the title really didn't fit the quality of the show, made it sound shallow and fluff, so I passed over The Unusuals many times in the past. Maybe you can't judge a book by it's cover but at the very least the cover needs to say pick me up and take a look inside."
"ABC should be shot over and over again for not keeping this show. I LOVED IT! I only watched it because of the Amazon ratings. Someone at NBC should try to get it back. This was a gem with great plots, great characters, genuine emotion, and lots of humor---- all so very rare on tv. They made only a couple of mistakes: they needed a little summary at the beginning of each episode so you could get caught up if it was your first episode...you have to do this with continuing story lines. And, sorry, but I thought the lead should have been a bigger, gorgeous guy, although the guy in it was a great actor.BRING IT BACK!"
"Good police drama plots. Even better characters. And liked Amber Tamblyn previously in &#34;Joan of Arcadia&#34;. Unfortunately, This series did not even make it to the 13 episode cut before it was cancelled. Just one of sooo many shows . . ."
I had never heard of this show till i saw it on prime.  I thought it was wonderful.  It has great characters and plots with really good comedy relief.
Renner in a funny cop tv show!! How did it get droppedafter only two seasons?? Gotta see it if you like off beathumor!
"This story is a magnificent crime drama, I especially enjoy the interaction between the two main characters and the interesting plot twiwts!"
It is a dramady (drama with comedy mixed in).  It is good that they try the make the characters real with  normal.  Not like super cops with no character defects.
I was skeptical about this show after reading that it was reminiscent of M*A*S*H.  It has it's own personality but with that special touch that M*A*S*H had.  A wonderful cast with crazy stories and personalities I'd love to see again and again!  It's painful to know that this is the only season but it's worth watching time and again.  And I will continue to watch it as long as it's available!
"This was a very entertaining series.  Good plots, good acting, interesting characters.  Plenty of humor to go with the crime stuff.  Even my wife liked it, and she is not a t.v. person in general.  Can't imagine watching these series on network t.v. with constant commercial breaks.  But they are great on Amazon Prime."
"i am a lover of brit television, so i was surprised, pleasantly, and ecstatic, discovering this gem of american television. this is a romp--witty, sexy, intelligent entertainment, the best kind of comic book.  in my unabashed enjoyment of this s how, i was perplexed as to why it was only one season, and, then, i watched the episode in which banks beats up an alleged serial killer, and it struck me that a black man, beating a white man, even if the black man is a cop and the white man is a very bad guy,. does not sit well with the powers that be, in hollywood, and that's a pity because this show was as brilliant as anything the brits produce--really. it deserves five-out-of-five."
"Really enjoyed the characters and watched every episode on instant video and when I could not find a second season, bought the DVD so that I can watch the original episodes whenever I feel like it.  Sorry Sony, no publicity and stumbled across the series with no help from you."
It is a shame that it was only one season.  It was  quirky and interesting.  would like to see more of it.
awesome i liked all of the actors in this series. I wish they had continued this show for many for years than it aired.  Maybe they can bring it back.
I loved this series so much that I had to watch back to back episodes until I saw them all. There's a great mix of comedy and drama. I wish there were more episodes to watch.
It was a good show. A little over the top but interesting.Good actors and good story plot.sorry it's over bye
This deserved a longer run on Network TV but was cancelled by ABC wayu too quickly. Thoroughly superior series with enjoyable comedy drama. Leaves you wanting much more.
"I was pleasantly surprised by this show.  I choose this show strictly because we were looking for a good series and Amazon offered it free for AmazonPrime members.  It is a really good show.  The main characters were well cast.  The only drawback for us was the music, which was way too loud.  So I had to turn the volume down now and then, between scenes.  It was a bit frustrating.  But the show is well worth your time.  It centers around a group of detectives in New York City.  All the quirks and faults of each detective was believeable.  I recommend this show.  Well worth your time to watch this.  I'm sorry there was only one season."
I like the group of misfit characters they have assembled as NY police detectives. The stories are good and the characters interact very well with each other. I wish there were more than one season to watch.
"Looking forward to seeing more shows like this all the time on Prime!Interesting,funny, and full of excitement with drama to boot."
"This show is really good. I enjoyed watching it..characters are not boring, scenes meaningful to me, and its funny. Definitely a TV show I like to own."
"It was funny, quick action, no gore and exceptionally well-acted.  I was disappointed to learn it was only one season. Thank you."
"I have to admit I had my doubts at first, but once I completed the first episode, I was hooked.  The acting was first rate and Jeremy Renner iswonderful, as always.  The quirkiness (hope that's a word) of the characters is endearing without being sentimental and by the time the &#34;season&#34; was over, I was quite invested the the &#34;wellbeing&#34; of the characters as they each dealt with their personal demons. This show was cancelled way, way too soon."
"I enjoyed this series, and really wish it had been renewed.  The relationships between the detectives was the most enjoyable part of the series for me."
Great tv show. Didn't watch it when it was on tv.  Inaptly named and poorly described was the problem.  Now Renner is a big movie star and I bet those white collars are kicking themselves.  Many unresolved issues at the series end. Worth watching.
"My review is going to sound redundant, but this was an excellent show.  A perfect mix of comedy and crime, never too much comedy (i.e. never gets too ridiculous like Brooklyn Nine-Nine) and never too heavy (i.e. Law & Order SVU).  Why did they cancel it?  Was it originally on Fox or something?  DId it get &#34;Fireflied&#34;?  Why do the execs always do this?"
This is the best cop series I have ever seen. The characters as so original. The stories are are so imaginative and not derivative like so many cop shows.  I hated it when I realized I was watching the last episode.
interesting- good cop show. wanted to see more. each character was fully developed and story line credible. will they make any more episodes?
"Excellent cast, stories well written, can't understand why it wasn't renewed for another season.  They left us with a few cliff hangers!"
I really am enjoying this series. Too bad it was cancelled.  It is quirky and fun. It doesn't take itself too seriously but still has action in it.
I really enjoyed the series. The characters were interesting and the relationships had rapport. Would really like to see more of this series.
I enjoyed watching this series while it was on prime instant video but is not anymore and I don't care to purchase the remaining episodes I didn't get to watch.
I really liked this series and am so sorry it did not get a fan base to support it! The characters were all interesting and all aspects of the plots were great! Good music and good humor to leaven some the more serious plots in the first season. I would recommend it to anyone!
"This review is for the Mythbusters ""Curving Bullets"" episode. I was disapointed when I missed this episode on cable, so was happy to find it on-demand.The myths covered here are the Curving Bullets as found hereWanted (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)(with Kari *very pregnant*, Grant, and Tory) and Sonic Boom Braking Glass (with Jamie and Adam).As usual, there is a good amount of humor in each of the segments and you can tell that they enjoyed shooting (pun intended) this firearm heavy episode. It was also great seeing the Blue Angel jets in the Sonic Boom episode.I will not say what the results were for these two, but it was a very enjoyable episode.Highly Recommended!"
Always impressed. It is very fascinating and educational. This show is almost the Bill Nye of the twentieth century. FILLER.
My son introduced me to this show and I must say that I find it quite fasinating.  I have learned a lot about science and been reminded of things long forgotten from school days.  The boys of course love the &#34;big booms&#34; associated with many of the experiments and projects on the shows.  This is fun for our family to watch together.
"I love this series, how can anyone give it a one is beyond me.  I love it because there is no prize money at the finish line, no back stabbing or secret alliances to kick others off the show.  It's only with pure will and determination that each individual wants to push themselves to see what they are made of, to have a real life challenging experience, to learn new things to form real bonds and learn to work together to create a tight community, each person working and helping each other for a common but individual goal. This is as real as it gets."
"Take a dozen or so everyday people,  throw them out into the wild (in this case Alaska), with some survival orientation, and see how they do. Being outdoor people ourselves, we found this series very addictive. It really comes down to who has the will to survive, although what body type you have is also definitely a factor. The survivors really do become family and depend on each other to make it from day to day. Every day they need to find the basics for survival- shelter, water, food, fire/warmth. These are no longer a &#34;given&#34; as they are in their normal lives, and as time goes on the constant struggle takes a toll.  A neat show- can't wait to see season 2."
"A group of 9 people from all different walks of life come together to survive wild Alaska with nothing much to live on.. 5 of the original 9 end up dropping out of the experiment  but 4 eventually make it back to civilization. It took them almost 30 days to get back. It was interesting to watch as they made 1 mistake after another and the lack of food, central heating and creature comforts took it's toll on the individuals."
"The item arrived very quickly and was in perfect condition.  The purchase, etc., was very easy.  I would be very happy to make further purchases from this seller in the future."
this set of dvd's was a gift for a friend overseas and I sure they are going to be upset to learn the series was cancelled
I had forgotten how much I had love this show. I have a good selection of actors and actresses. I won't recommend this for young children. There is some violence and language.
I now own the entire series and have not been disappointed with any of the sets. Well worth the purchase price.
Arrived before pre-determined time and in the condition promised great service did not have any issues with product or retailer
I love In Plain Sight! This offbeat series is one that I will order as long as it is on television.
Mary Shepherd would hate being called a heroine.  She does her job in a no nonsense manner while juggling and caring for her wildly dysfunctional family. This is a not-to-be-missed series.
Loved the first season so now I'm loving the second one too.  Mary and Marshall pop off each other so well.
"In Plain Sight is the most dramatic show on USA network, and it shines because of it. The depth of character in this show is something that Burn Notice and Psych should really admire. Mary's family gives you the drama that you need and the WITSEC witnesses give you the regular procedural case. Mary is a Marshal for the US government and her duty is to protect witnesses and assign them new identities. She is partnered up with Marshal, yes a Marshall named Marshal. Their jabs at each other are always enjoyable to watch, but at all times you can see there is a deep layer of trust between them. Their boss is Stan and he helps keep the ""maverick"" Mary in line, or at least he tries. Both Stan and Marshal get center screen once during the season. This was a great move by the writers because these actors were well up to the task and those two episodes were some of the best in the season. I hope they do that again in season 3 to flesh out these characters even more. Eleanor was added this season as a new character in the WITSEC office. Her banter with Mary is quite enjoyable. I hope that they flesh out her character as the show progresses, because I think she has some skeletons in her closet. Mary's mother and sister add some great plotlines to help develop Mary's personal life. I think that her mother Jinx gets to be a little annoying as the season progresses, but her episodes in the beginning of the season make up for her late season antics. Brandi's boyfriend was a nice addition as well as you finally see some redemption in her future. I do have a small complaint this season. Mary's anxiety over killing the drug dealer at the end of last season was tied up way too quickly. I feel like they could have expanded on that more. The season ends in some thrilling and heart wrenching moments, but now that I have seen the Season 3 premiere it looks like they've done it again. They have already tied up the events of this season's finale in one episode. Why must they move on so quickly when a new season starts. These finales are so well written and advance these characters so well, yet they move away from them and their plotlines as quickly as possible. The writing throughout the season is touching and always top notch. These characters change a lot over the season, and never get stale like in most procedural dramas. The video quality is much better than other USA Network releases thankfully and has a sharp picture. The bonus features are decent, but the none of them are earth shattering. If you like great dramas that are a mix of family dysfunction and a classic procedural then I recommend In Plain Sight highly."
"This is truely a great show! Watching the reaction of the cast (especially Mary's partner) after Mary is shot is truely gut-wrenching. In fact, I was so totally envolved watching season 1&2 for 2 stright days I did not realize that they were over! Hopefully, Season 3 will come out soon. I sincerely hope that I am not the only one who appreciates this show!"
Ordered the Glee first season and love every minute of it. I am not a broadway song and dance guy but the clever fusion of music and story line in Glee makes it compelling TV. Give the show a chance and it will grow on you. Second season has also started off with a bang.
"I went to high school in the mid 60s so glee club was much more like a church choir than the cast of FAME in performance.  Don't get me wrong--I love it.  If it is this way, that is fantastic.  I can't understand if it is like this why it is not more popular in the school. Why would being a cheerleader be more popular than singing and dancing onstage like a top Broadway production?  The numbers are great and even if the characters don't move you, the numbers are great fun.  The characters are good though.  Right now we've just had the gay young man who is a glee member come out to his father.  We also have two deceptions going on as to being pregnant, the teacher's wife who really isn't and the head cheerleader who is blaming the wrong high schooler.  But perhaps my favorite character is the coach of the cheerleaders.  She is in a perpetual snit because there is even a glee club and is acting like a commando guerilla warrior to bring the glee club down.  She is hilarious.  Very well done series and very, very different."
"Great music and interesting character arcs, I have enjoyed watching this show and somehow I always seem to shed a tear."
"This is a funny series and the music is great.  The actors have really good voices, dancing, and acting abilities. This is such a fun show."
"I hate show tunes, but love this show! I think it's greatest strength is it's cast, even when the writing is a little choppy they still can make you care about them."
"This show is amazing. So many talented performers putting a great musical-comedy every week. Seems impossible to do. These actors and writers are the best in TV. I'm not into much current television, but this show surely brightens my evening. Everyone should give it a chance. You think this shows not for you? You're probably wrong. Haven't loved a program so much since Buffy went off the air. Instant classic. Up there with Buffy, Twin Peaks and a couple of other landmarks. Give it a shot."
"With a lot of hype behind the teen musical/comedy/drama series ""Glee"", many people catching ""American Idol"" wondered what this new series would be about.  The series created by Ryan Murphy (writer for ""Nip/Tuck"", ""Popular""), Brad Falchuk (producer for ""Nip/Tuck"") and Ian Brennan would gain attention because of its music but for the most part, it would prove to become successful with its catchy music (with actual talent that can sing), a witty storyline and its well-cast characters.The series proved to become so popular that two soundtracks have been released for the television series and even was nominated for four 2010 Golden Globe Awards.  With support from various media sites to even celebrities and a fanbase that have branded themselves as ""gleeks"". ""Glee"", although not exactly original (""Fame"" was known for its musical teens in the 1980's and the teenage jock musical was featured heavily in the Disney ""High School Musical"" films) and a cast of talent playing teenagers from various ethnicities and even one who is handicapped, ""Glee"" manages to capture the drama of high school life but also the fun of watching this group of underdogs trying to succeed.""glee - The Complete First Season"" features the following 22 episodes on seven DVD's.VIDEO:""glee - The Complete First Season"" is presented in widescreen 1:78:1.  Shot digitally, this is a series that I'm sure would look fantastic on the Blu-ray release.  As for the DVD release, picture quality is cool as some parts showcase the vibrant colors of the series but one thing I noticed is that the pilot episode definitely shows a lot of noise but as the series progressed towards the second half of the first seaosn, picture quality was much better.  Blacks are nice and deep and skin tones look natural on the DVD but for the most part, picture quality for ""glee"" very good on DVD.  But for those who are concerned with picture quality will definitely want to ""glee - The Complete First Season"" on Blu-ray.  Otherwise, the DVD is good.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""glee - The Complete First Season"" is presented in English 5.1 Dolby  Digital Surround.  The series is front and center channel driven but with those who own modern home-theater receivers may find it a benefit to have the audio set at stereo on all channels if they have a 5.1, 7.2 or higher setup.  Audio is clear and understandable but what matters for a series such as ""glee"" is how the music sounds and for the most part, music sounds great.  There is crowd ambiance in the school hallways or chatter in during the competitions but for the most part, ""glee"" is a front and center channel-driven soundtrack.  And similar to the video, if you are an audiophile, then you will definitely want the lossless soundtrack and go with the Blu-ray version.Subtitles are presented in English SDH, Spanish, French and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:""glee - The Complete First Season"" comes with the following special features:DISC 4:* Welcome to McKinley! - (5:02) A video of Principal Figgins introducing 8th graders to his office before they go to McKinley High School.

It's really interesting to see how the group dynamics start to evolve from the beginning to the 13th episode and by the second half, you can tell that the hiatus leading to the second half of the series and the popularity of the series definitely made the series get a boost in the types of music that can be utilized, better production value and the cast seem to gel much more.And it's no surprise as 2009-2010 have been incredible for the cast members and crew.  From award nominations, the cast receiving love from a lot of television show critics and soundtracks that continue to sell incredibly well.  ""glee"" also features solid writing that goes hand-in-hand with the awesome musical performances and for the most part, ""glee - The Complete First Season"" is a fantastic DVD set.But what hooked me to the series was the music.  Personally, I'm not a fan of covers but the fact that the people on the show can sing and for the most part, how the songs are incorporate to the storyline has definitely made me a weekly viewer of the series.  Also, the talent can sing...Matthew Morrison, Leah Michele and Amber Riley do a great job but also for the writers to recognize that its not good that only a few characters receive the spotlight and diversifying the various musical performances to other characters as well, so they can showoff their vocals.Also, it's important to note that these characters are not perfect teens and not everyone bursts into song ala ""High School Musical"".  ""Glee"" is not a group of perfect teenagers, each of these characters have their faults but these characters are well fleshed out in the series that you actually care about these characters and each play their part in each episode.  Will, a teacher and the director of the Glee Club deals with his marital strife with his wife, who is determined to make sure her husband doesn't leave him.  Quinn must deal with being a single mother, Mercedes deals with her weight, Artie deals with being in a wheel chair, Curt deals with how people look at him because he is homosexual and each characters has their own set of issues.  It's high school life and it's great to see the students have their own set of issues, as well as the adults.While the first season had a pretty interesting storyline with Will trying to get the glee club going and dealing with his wife, the second half of the series is where things get even more interesting in drama dynamics.  Throw in Jesse St. James of Vocal Adrenaline, throw in Curt falling for Finn, Quinn having to deal with her pregnancy and finding friendship from a person she never expected to get close to, seeing things develop between Will and Emma and more.  And of course, Sue Sylvester was absolutely wonderful this season.  And as for the music, especially with the Madonna and Lady Gaga episodes, the music for the whole season was fantastic.There is no doubt that ""glee"" is a series that now has a great budget to license these songs for television, CD and also for the DVD release and just by seeing the sheer amount of songs used on each episode, I'm sure that the music takes a big chomp out of the budget.  But that is what makes ""glee"" work and that is the ability to use contemporary music (and classics) to attract listeners of young and old.Also, by the second season, it looks as if the talent are more at ease and comfortable working with each other.  The vocals are of the cast are much better, the chemistry between the characters are also well done (the interaction between Will and Sue is fantastic) and there is better use of the characters that like Santana and Brittany and also getting some of the other background characters involved as well.For those who purchased ""glee Season 1 Volume 1' and intend to purchase ""glee - The Complete First Season"".  You can also get a $10 rebate by sending the proof of purchase that comes with this DVD set and also providing a mail-in form and a barcode from the first DVD release.Overall, there are a good amount of special features on this DVD box set to keep Gleeks busy but for those who wonder what the hub-bub is all about and why the media is giving so much coverage to this series, check this DVD out and you'll see what is so special about ""glee"".  It's a series that is fun to watch, cool characters, solid performances and a series that has a fantastic soundtrack.  ""glee - The Complete First Season"" is highly recommended!"
Scooby-Doo's Original Mysteries...Glee: The Complete First Season...just so happy love it own all the seasons...a real pick me up series!~
This series is well worth watching.  There are many talented cast members and the music is the best.  Try it!
The only season of Glee worth watching is the first. Good start to a show. The show was really good. Watch the the other seasons and you will see how bad this show sucks now. This isa very funny show. If you like Glee get this.
I loved this sooooo much that I just recently purchased it on blu-ray! I am a Gleek through and through!
"I was on an extended work assignment away from home when I discovered this series.  I streamed the first four seasons in the evenings there, and fell in love with the characters, the story lines, and the singing/dancing.  Delightful."
"In unimpressive Lima, Ohio, the kids sing impressively. With Fox as its network launching pad and feeding off that AMERICAN IDOL fervor, GLEE is FAME for the 21st Century, with obvious whiffs of POPULAR and FREAKS & GEEKS. Like those shows before it, GLEE demonstrates that ""misfits and spazheads and cripples can make it, too."" Sure, the episodes tend to be silly and breezy and over-the-top. And we get that predictable high heap of teen angst and snark and we're subjected to that time-honored high school caste system and even some drawn out baby mama drama. But the joyous and sometimes sublime musical performances make everything gravy. GLEE is exuberant and fresh and drags its fans along its giddy wake. Just you beware the predatory slushy.The premise hangs on high school Spanish teacher Will Schuester taking a crack at reviving his school's woeful Glee Club, at the time a repository for the school's teen social outcasts (members include a stutterer, a fat chick, a guy in a wheelchair, etc.). The season follows the Glee Club's journey as it comes together and competes in the Sectional and Regional show choir circuits. The cast makes it all work, with particular nods to Lea Michele (really terrific as Rachel, the talented but abrasive teen diva), Matthew Morrison (the idealistic Will Schuester), and the outstanding Jane Lynch (she won an Emmy as that colossal ego, Coach Sue Sylvester). Everyone does their own singing, some of them professionally trained, some not. It's ridiculous how popular this show got so quickly, and the prestige it's gathered.Some very noteworthy performers have added their talents (or given their blessings) to GLEE. There's the episode devoted entirely to Madonna, and another that is Olivia Newton-John-centric. The sensational Kristin Chenoweth demonstrates her pipes as she guest-stars in two episodes. Neil Patrick Harris shows up as an embittered glee club alum and sings two duets with Mr. Shoe. But, really, it's all about the underdog kids who stop being underdogs the moment they belt out a tune. Their performances are amazing, many are showstoppers (and, I dunno, I think it's a particular bit of awesome whenever the big bully Puck sings). The song selections cover a wide range of genres, from Broadway to rock to rap, from contemporary and old school, Color Me Badd rubbing elbows with Journey and Kanye and Queen; and the mash-ups rock the hizzy. I think it's funny that Mr. Shoe every now and then busts it old school with a Young MC or Vanilla Ice track. So the storylines may go down like a tall drink of whatever; that didn't matter. It's all about the kids singing their hearts out, man.And because we all like making lists, here's one of my favorite performances: Rachel's ""Gives You Hell"" and ""Don't Rain On My Parade,"" Kurt & Rachel's ""Defying Gravity,"" Kristin Chenoweth's ""Maybe This Time,"" Mr. Shoe and New Directions' ""Golddigger,"" Puck's ""Sweet Caroline,"" and New Directions' ""Ride Wit Me."" And that's just off the top of my head.GLEE - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON has 22 episodes on seven discs and with impressive bonus material (but no audio commentaries):- ""Welcome to McKinley!"" - Principal Figgins conducts an amusing orientation program for the William McKinley High School (00:05:03 minutes long)- GLEE music video (""Somebody to Love"")- ""Full Length Audition Pieces"" - Rachel singing ""On My Own"" and Mercedes singing ""Respect"" from the pilot episode- ""Casting Session"" goes into the casting choices of Lea Michele, Cory Monteith, and Chris Colfer (00:11:59)- ""Deconstructing GLEE with series creator Ryan Murphy"" is self-explanatory (00:02:50)- ""Dance Boot Camp"" - Cast interviews about their undergoing dance lessons (00:03:13)- ""Jane Lynch: From A to GLEE"" - just a few of Sue Sylvester's bon mots (00:00:54 seconds)- ""Meet Jane Lynch"" (00:01:05)- ""5 Things You Don't Know About Jayma"" (00:00:41)- ""7 Things You Don't Know About Cory"" (00:01:01)- ""6 Things You Don't Know About Amber"" (00:00:59)- ""7 Things You Don't Know About Chris"" (00:00:43)- Video Diaries from 8 cast members, centering on their trip to New York to promote the show (totaling 00:17:11)- Glee Music Jukebox (musical performances from GLEE episodes)- ""GLEE Sing-Along Karaoke"" - sub-titles provided for four songs performed in GLEE: ""Alone,"" ""Somebody to Love,"" ""Keep Holding On,"" and ""Don't Stop Believin'""- ""Unleashing The Power of Madonna"" - the cast & crew reflect on Madonna's music and influence and talk about the episode ""The Power of Madonna"" which is devoted entirely to her (00:10:37)- ""Staying In Step With GLEE"" - the show's choreographers break down the dance steps to the ""Rehab"" routine (00:06:20)- ""Bite Their Style: Dress Like Your Favorite Gleek"" - the costume designers demonstrate the various wardrobes and styles worn by four of the show's  characters: Rachel, Kurt, Mercedes, Quinn (00:08:53)- ""Making of a Showstopper"" goes behind the scenes of Vocal Adrenalin's rendition of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" from the season-ending episode (00:17:22)"
Love love love this show.  Love the dancing and singing and the comedy and drama.  It is a great show
"While my school didn't have a show choir, Glee brings back a lot of fond memories of making friends and going to competitions.  It's also great to have a show like this that embraces the arts in schools and shows how music can bring people together."
"For the first season its very funny and at times very educational in teaching people how to views others at times,... overall very good show will keep on watching other seasons. for though that love watching the voice and singing shows will love Glee."
"This is quality entertainment. I completely didn't expect much from this, I was wrong, very wrong."
I got into glee late and loving the show its great to watch with the family and sign along to the songs you know. Love their performance at the regional finals. Hope it continues to flow as well as it has through out the season. I love when they sing Journey's songs awesome.
A refreshing unique show that shows how life is for high schoolers in a little town in Ohio who are in a Glee Club. The characters-both students and teachers will make you see life differently and make you laugh and be sympathetic to a character within moments of each other.
"Fun musical numbers and great acting. It is a little too much of a soap opera drama for me, but it didn't stop me from really enjoying it."
"I didn't watch Glee when it originally aired.  Guess I had too many other shows to watch.  Since I told DirecTv where they could put their satellite dish, I'm enjoying Amazon Prime to watch shows I had previously missed.Glee is an awesome show.  I watched Seasons 1 through 4 and I'm waiting for Season 5 to finish before I start watching that.  I decided to watch 1 through 4 again while I wait.  It just kept getting better.  I think you get more involved when you watch a series all at once instead of weekly installments.  It's nice to see their voices mature and get better.Burt Hummel is the best dad ever.Sad that Cory Monteith is gone...amazing to see how many people's lives he touched."
"A  nice change from typical TV and its brought back the musical in a sense.  Glee touches on all types of discriminations without focusing too much on the high school model.  In fact, the teachers are some of the best supporting characters, especially Sue Sylvester (who sometimes steals the show) a la Jane Lynch who first stood out for me in ROLE MODELS.  The creators tapped into Broadway stars to pull this one off and it worked.  The nice thing about the songs is that they don't stick to one decade.  In fact, they cover songs that all generations can remember them even if they're all updated.  This is arguably one of the hottest TV shows in several years and the visiting A list actors and actresses supports my stance.  MY GRADE: A minus to A."
"Ok, so I have to admit, when I saw the advertisements for this show, all I could think of was that it looked cheesy and very tween centered.  Then I saw an episode on TV, intrigued I took a look at Hulu and caught some of the second season episodes they had there.  Now, its a guilty pleasure and I just had to get the first season to see how it all started.Glee is a great show in that its positive.  Sure there's some mature themes in it, but really, its about life and that just makes it more realistic.  It shows overcoming obstacles and reaching for your dreams.  But most importantly, it has great music.  Glee is about the New Directions, a glee club who isn't very popular at school but enjoys each other's company and can put on quite the show.  They have several struggles and triumphs through the series and in order to stay as a club at the school, have the ultimate goal of placing in regionals to keep their funding.Characters:Artie Abrams (Kevin Mchale) is a paraplegic and a guitar player.  He has dreams of being a dancer and also is a love interest for Tina.Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) is annoying yet determined.  She wants to be a star and will let nothing stand in her way.  She grows through the series and has to learn that it isn't all about her, despite her talent.Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) is a goth wonderful singer with a stutter.  She spends most of her time with Mercedes and Artie and learns to accept herself for who she is and not drive people away.Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) is head cheerleader and cruelly vicious.  After spying for Sue Sylvester on the glee club and then ending up pregnant, she instead finds solace and friendship in the group.Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) is a little unintelligent but has a lot of heart.  Quarterback of the football team he is blackmailed into joining the glee club because of his outstanding voice, but later learns that its where he wants to be.Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) is an out of the closet gay student.  He has a wonderful singing voice, and is a bit diva-ish but really appreciates his friends.  He is often bullied for his unique nature.Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) is a main diva.  She isn't afraid to express who she is and competes with Rachel for solos in the club.  She is a Cheerio at one point, but returns to Glee because its where her heart is.Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) is another of Sue's spies but admits that Glee is the best part of her day.  She gives the other members a hard time and is sometimes vicious.Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) is another of Sue's spies but cannot perform the task adequately as she is a complete airhead.  She's a great dancer and often unintentionally provides comic relief for the group.Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) is the school's guidance counselor.  She has extreme OCD and during most of the season has a crush on Will that in some parts is returned.  She is also engaged to the coach Ken Tanaka during the series.Noah Puckerman (Mark Salling) is the bad boy of the group.  Known for his trademark mohawk and being great with the ladies, he joins the glee club after being in the Acafellas with Will.  He is a love interest for several of the group's girls.Will Schuester (Mark Morrison) is the glee club director and Spanish teacher.  He has a good heart but doesn't always listen to the kid's on what they want.  But he learns quickly and always tries to do his best for them.  A former Glee club member himself, he is a great singer and dancer.  He has a lot of love interests and has trouble with relationships.Terry Schuester (Jessalyn Gilsig) is Will's neurotic wife.  Originally seen as controlling and bossy, she mellows out when trying to hide a secret from Will.  She cannot overcome her jealousy and suspicion however and does not add to the relationship very much.Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) is definitely the nemesis of the Glee Club.  Head of the vastly awarded Cheerio's she is upset that Will's club is cutting into her budget.  She'll stop at nothing to destroy the New Directions.  She does have moments where her inner goodness shines out however, and it keeps the audience guessing.Mike Chang (Harry Shum Jr) is a football player who is also a great dancer.  He plays a minor role in the series but is great at backup.Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) is Kurt's father.  He's a bit confused about how to do right for his gay son, but ultimately loves him and wants the best for him.Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman) is the head of the school paper and has an extreme crush on Rachel.  She is often seen trying to avoid him.Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter) is a member of the Cheerio's that has Down Syndrome.  She becomes Sue's special sidekick.Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton) is a football member that has joined glee club.  He plays a very minor part often doing backup.Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) is a nice guy but easily mislead.  He cowtows to Sue and often doesn't rule favorably for the glee club.  He tries to do what is right however and does save them once in awhile.Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky) is the former glee club director.  He was removed for inappropriate conduct and is later used for comic relief and the selling of illegal drugs.Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) is the coach of the school teams.  He is in love with Emma and jealous of Will.  He causes problems at times but ultimately is just a guy who wants to be loved.Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel) is the coal of the rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline.  She is also Rachel's biological mother.Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff) is the lead singer of Vocal Adrenaline.  For a time he is a love interest of Rachel's before becoming a rival again.April Rhodes (Kristin Chenowenth) is a washed up former glee club member who never finished high school.  After a stroke of good luck and some help from Will she ends up rich and helps out the glee club.There are many other characters, but most play minor roles.As a whole I think they did a great job of casting the characters.  They also included some cameos such as Josh Groban and Olivia Newton John and also Neil Patrick Harris.  There were some characters that I just didn't care for however.  I'm not a big fan of the Emma Pillsbury character.  I realize she's a love interest for Will but I think her arc in the story takes a lot away from the show's true purpose; the glee club.  She also, despite her eccentricities, just isn't that interesting and I can't see why Will would be interested in her.  The same would go for her boyfriend in the series, Ken Tanaka.  He makes things hard for Will and the football players, but aside from that, doesn't add too much.Most of the characters I love though.  Artie is fantastic and you really feel compassion for him especially in the episode on dancing.  Sue Sylvester is great.  She plays the perfect villain and I can never tell what she's going to do next.  All of the Glee club members really know how to put on a show.Episodes:The First Season has 22 episodes and they are all jam-packed with music, dancing, and your soap opera-ish type plot lines that seem to be popular.**Warning, some of these episode descriptions could be considered spoilers for plot lines.Pilot:This introduces us to the gang and also to the formidable Will Scheuster, a Spanish teacher, former glee club member, and the new director of the Glee club.  The group largely consists of outcasts and starts only five members strong.  But they've got talent, it just needs to be explored.  We are also introduced to Will's formidable wife Terry and the guidance counselor who has a crush on him, Emma Pillsbury.Shomance:In order to try to get some new members (and not be slushied in the face) the group puts together a number to sing in front of the whole school.  Will takes on some new responsibility since he has learned Terri is pregnant, but she isn't telling him the whole truth. Glee Club's Arch Nemesis Sue Sylvester (coach of the award winning Cheerio's cheer squad) sends some cheerleaders as spies into the glee club.Acafellas:Will forms an all male vocal group and in doing so gives up some responsibility to the glee club.  They hire a dance instructor, but realize that they just need to accept each other for who they are.  Especially Kurt as he struggles with his sexuality.Preggers:In this episode, Kurt comes out of the closet, but also joins the football team. Quinn tells Finn that he is the father of her baby and they have to decide what they are going to do with their future despite the fact that she knows Puck is actually the father.  The Glee club also helps the football team win a game.The Rhodes Not Taken:With Rachel quitting to perform in the school play, Will enlists former glee member April Rhodes to be in the glee club.  As she never graduated high school, she is still able to do this.  While struggling to overcome April's bad influence on the group and competing at sectionals, the glee clubbers have a lot on their plate.Vitamin D:After their success at Invitationals, the team feels too confident to perform adequately so Will has the girls compete against the boys.  However, Terri, newly appointed as the school nurse gives the kids over the counter drugs to help them pep up and ultimately gets them in even more trouble.Throwdown:With Sue as co-director of the Glee club, things couldn't be more tense.  She tries to pit the group against each other and then the group becomes even more disheveled when its revealed to the rest of the school that Quinn is pregnant.Mash-Up:When asked to come up with a way to mash two very unlikely song together for Emma and Ken's wedding, Will has to struggle with his feelings for Emma.  These aren't the only relationship problems in this episode as Finn, Quinn, Rachel, and Puck all have to deal with their feelings as well.Wheels:When its revealed how hurt Artie is that he can't travel with the rest of the group they try to raise money to rent a wheelchair accessible school bus for him to take to regionals.  Artie learns something unexpected about Tina, and Sue shows her softer side.Ballad:Will assigns the group a task to sing ballads to each other about how they feel.  This results in a lot of secrets being exposed and Finn telling Quinn's parents about her pregnancy.Hairography:When they see their competition for regionals (and Will is subsequently impressed by their use of hair in dance) they all don the wings and have a rockin time using ""Hairography"" in their routines.  Quinn considers putting the baby up for adoption.Mattress:After a big uproar about the team not appearing in the yearbook Rachel finds a way to try to make them popular again by starring in a local Mattress company commercial.  This compromises them however, as they are paid in mattresses and this could disqualify them from competition.  Will discovers Terri has been lying to him about her pregnancy and spends the night at the school.Sectionals:With Will stepping down from coaching the club, Emma postpones her wedding to take the team to sectionals where they learn that their set-list as been leaked to the opposing teams.  With not a lot of hope in sight, and Finn not showing up as he learns the truth about Quinn's baby, they have to find a way to win in spite of the troubles.Hell-O:This ones all about relationships.  Will and Emma struggle to accept each other the way they are.  Finn is undecided about Rachel and Sue has Santana and Brittany try to ruin that relationship.  Rachel also meets the lead singer of a rival glee club and makes a connection.The Power of Madonna:Just like it sounds, this episode pays homage to Madonna.  With the girls feeling inferior, Will assigns them Madonna songs hoping it will make them feel empowered.Home:When Finn finds out that his mother and Kurt's father are dating he's not sure how to take it. April comes back and helps the team with their auditorium problems and Mercedes learns to feel good about herself.Bad Reputation:After a list ranking the glee club members by hotness circulates, they try to figure out ways to make themselves ""badder"" in order to rise on the list.  This results in relationships being broken, feelings being hurt, and quite a bit of slushie facials.Laryngitis:When Rachel loses her voice she thinks its the end of the world.  Kurt struggles with his identity and begins dating Brittany.Dream On:When Will's old rival in glee club Bryan Ryan wants to cut Glee from the school budget, he has to give up some of his dreams in order to keep it going.  Artie also has to come to term with his dreams of being a dancer.Theatricality:This episode pays homage to Lady Gaga and all her craziness.  Rachel meets her mother and Kurt and Finn's families move in together creating tension.Funk:After feeling a bit defeated by Vocal Adrenaline, a competing team, Will teaches the glee club that they have funk and soul.  Rachel is also devastated when Jesse returns to Vocal Adrenaline.Journey:The team's performance at Regionals will determine their future in the school.  However, they've just learned that Sue is one of the judges and are feeling depressed.  Quinn goes into labor.As a whole the episodes are great and I enjoy the music.  I should note however that some of the plot lines tend to get stale and drawn out.  They also focus more on some characters than others and while the tension between Rachel and Finn is interesting, it just gets boring after awhile.  Some of the more minor characters have great back stories and I'd love to see it expanded.Some of the story lines were quite touching though.  Quite a few timse there were moments in the show that I could feel tears coming to my eyes.  Now that's good writing!Music:Since this is Glee I have to talk about the music.  The show uses a mix of modern tunes and old classics and of course show tunes.  They use Madonna, Lady Gaga, Journey, and other popular artists in their works.  The actors do their own singing but it is slightly noticeable that it is prerecorded.I did enjoy most of the music but thought they got a little heavy handed with the show tunes and broadway hits once in awhile.  Its not that they're not good songs, I just thought the performances and singing for the modern hits were much better done and also better coreographed.~~~This is a great family friendly tv series.  While it explores some mature themes (teen pregnancy, virginity, drugs, etc.) it does so in an approachable way and a parent can easily sit and explain right choices to their kids while watching.  But its also entertaining for adults.  There are plot lines that keep it interesting and music to keep you entertained.  While I would love to see more music there's only so much they can fit into an hour long episode.  Fantastic series and I highly recommend watching it.Review by M. Reynard 2010"
Thought this show was about high school kids so didn't watch it... But the grandkids got me into it because of all the show tunes they sang and they thought Lea Michele was such a great singer..so started watching it every week.
cory is so good and I miss him. glee is not the same without him but seeing them form the beginning is awsome
I had no idea what I was missing when I didn't include Glee in my shows to watch.  I am making up for lost time and catching up on it now.  The characters are so well played and I am a big fan of anything that includes music and dancing.I highly recommend it as a &#34;must&#34; show to watch.
I never started watching the show but with Amazon prime I was able to watch when I could. I really like the show. You quickly identify with certain characters and loathe others. But the singing is AMAZING!!!!
Interesting show that broke the mold on musical comedy on Television.  Enjoyed the singing and glad that singers with some talent were chosen.
"See my other reviews on other seasons of this show.  Each show is pretty long, not like an American show that does everything in 30 minutes, but well worth the time."
"My wife and I just finished watching Season 5 yesterday.  We know we're coming to the end of the line, so to speak.  If/when it ends, I hope there is something just as good.  Success like this isn't automatic.  It takes a lot of talented people - writers, producers, the backstage technical experts, and of course great actors.  This series has had it all for us."
Foyles War is brilliant.  The characters are great.  The history is real.  Truly a realistic view of the great generation.
"Foyle is superb! Honesty, integrity and intrigue are a great mix. Enjoyed Foyle immensely, recommend to all! Go for it!"
"This is another season of the great British mystery series of Foyle's War.The series is set in Great Britain during World War II and each successive season sees the progress through the war from the point of view of the Detective as he oversees the small constabulary of his town that covers the town and its surrounds.  He is a quiet and very effective detective who is constantly observant of his surroundings and great at deduction.  He refuses to be bullied or pushed around.  He knows what his job is and what is right and will not deviate from either.He can be thought of as a predecessor of the American police detective, Colombo."
"Very enjoyable, enjoyed the acting, and the perspective on the Second World War from the English perspective. Not to mention crime solving without all the bells and whistles of the usual police shows."
Another outstanding detective period series on BBC. The pacing is just right for the contemplative detective buff. The plots are varied and the actors have managed to give weight and verisimilitude to their parts. Thoroughly enjoyable!
Is it a surprise that allies who should have been friendly to each other had elements on both sides that didn't like each other at all?  This is evident in the early seasons of Foyle's War as Foyle solves the crimes during the American Occupation.  The idea that the Americans and English were all devoted buddies was basic WWII propaganda and the dialogue of this show does not support that concept.  The fact that Roosevelt showed a preference for Stalin over Churchill and that Obama returned a Churchill bust that had been displayed in the White House for about half a century is an indication of the continuing distaste a reactionary element of our population still holds for our English brothers.
"This is a terrific series.  I would have loved to see more shows that took place during the war years with the same actors and actresses.  I am sure there were a lot of incredible things that occurred during the war that could have made a longer series.  I was captivated by each story and I have just about wore out the DVDs watching them over and over.  I was born in December, 1942 so I was alive during that time even though I didn't know what was going on in the world.  These stories have shown to me what war time was like and has made me a part of that history.  Thanks."
"Whoever wrote this series did a splendid piece of work...We have watched each of the earlier shows several times. and each time have enjoyed it over again, and even noticed things that we had not observed before.  So it is with the later shows in the series.Actually, we would rate this 10 stars!!!"
"I am dreading the day I have to say good-bye to this series. The only character I don't like is Foyle's son who is very cocky. Sam warms your heart as does Foyle himself. I have loved this series as well as others from BBC. Watched The Grand, London Hospital and Downton Abbey. I don't watch regular TV anymore."
"Yet another season of Foyle's War that somehow my wife and I missed when our local PBS station aired it except for a small part of the last episode.  Regarding the genre drama/mystery thrillers, it just doesn't get any better than this.  Michael Kitchen and Honeysuckle Weeks mature in their roles; all of the acting is superb.  Definitely worth the watch!"
i really enjoyed this entire series and i hope that they have more episodes and seasons to come hoping for more is a great show
Foyles war is absolutely worth watching. British drama is number one and this series is no exception. I can not wait for the new series to begin and hope PBS shows it.
Foyle never fails to deliver a good story skilfully done.  the characters well done and the settinigs marvelously recreated. Bravo
"Each one of these is more like a movie than just a television series.  Good acting, plots and character development.  Hollywood doesn't even make anything for adults like this."
The same comments apply as stated before in my review of series 3.  The series was excellent without a doubt
I just found this series and am enjoying it very much.  You have to like the British mysteries to enjoy this.
"Foyle's War has taught us things about WWII that we did not know and they did it in a spell binding way.  We really enjoyed this show and wish there were more seasons.It has taken us some time getting used to the British shows running for an hour and a half or longer but with the Foyle series, the time flew."
Foyle's War is wonderful i love all the story lines. I'm fix to start watching the last two seasons and I have love each episode. Will miss it when I done.
This is an awesome series; I recommend it to everyone.  Series 6 is as good as all the previous 5.  Great plot and greatacting.  Don't miss this.
"Foyle's War is a superbly made series about a detective assigned to Hastings (of the Battle of Hastings) fame during World War II.  Each episode Foyle discovers the murderer by keen perception and paying attention to the details.  The relationship between him and his driver, Samantha, Sam, is witty and adds to the enjoyment of the series.  Unlike most American cop shows, Foyle's War always has light notes and make me happy."
"This series depicted the early 1940's in Hastings, England, during the war.  You not only receive a wonderful &#34;who done it&#34; which I could never figure out, but the series delivers a taste of England at that time period.  Well done.  Superb series."
All episodes were excellent and entertaining. Acting was great.every episodes. Well written well acted. Best series in a long time.
"This is an unusual &#34;mystery&#34; series, particularly in that the plot lines are very different from most others. The stories are also quite complex and fascinating in the way they interweave mystery with WWII matters. Nearly all of the acting is top-notch, and the production values are exceptional."
season six and final season was as good as all the rest. I'm sorry that there were not more. Well worth your time to watch all right from the start.
This series is one we will enjoy watching over again and again. The characters are so nicely developed and the story is so poignant
"Mr. Foyle is a British equivalent to Gary Cooper.  He doesn't say a whole lot but facial expressions rule the day.  The whole series is worth your time.  Free viewing on Amazon PRIME; you can join ACORN for a pittance and get a whole year of British TV series, most of which seem to be in the murder category.  The Brits seem to have a thing where there has to be at least 3 murders in each sequence...which is okay with me."
As usual Michael Kitchen is fantastic as the reserved and observent Christopher Foyle.  As we see so much more than the war is going on...it hasn't changed much what with the racketeering that went on through the Iraq war...oh yes it wasn't called that...but much the same anyway.  Sam Stewart as always a good counter balance to Foyles quiet reserved manner.
"The same could be said for Series 1-4 & 6:  We found ourselves 'rationing' the 3 episodes in the final season.  With our current penchant for sex, profanity and violence, it's hard to describe the overwhelming attraction that Foyle's War evokes.  Michael Kitchen can do more with minor facial movement than most actors could do with a 2-minute diatribe.  Sam, the driver, should have retired the UK-version of Best Supporting Actress.  Truth be told, it's the only TV series I've ever promised myself I would watch again a year or two hence -- that includes Friday Night Lights, the 2nd best."
"the interaction and balance of characters here is superb. kitchen is dry and charming, ms. weeks is excellent as the plucky young officer and the fellow playing milner is well done with just enough equal parts bitterness and practicality to make him believable. they are an amazing ensemble."
"20 years later this show still makes me laugh until I cry. Wish it was available in HD. It's big, it's heavy, it's wood..."
"I use to watch this on Saturday mornings before going out to play with my friends. This show is crazy. Watching now and understanding more of it, you realize how zany it was for its time. This is one of my all time favorite cartoons."
Nothing like cracking up to these two. Their antics and banter with each other will have you laughing till you cry.
"This was probably one of the most abrasive and rude programs to ever hit &#34;normal&#34; television. And it is still just as funny. The humor is crude, crass, and socially unacceptable. What's not to love?!"
"This show deals with a lot of basic little kid problems like being scared to try new things and being upset when things don't work out the way you want them too. I use the episodes to help teach my daughter how to deal with things that she is having a hard time with. This is a Great show for toddlers. It also teaches a few Chinese words each episode, and the main character often addresses the audience to prompt participation."
My son is 5 years old and loves this show.  It is educational and teaches great social skills!! Clean and fun!
"She watches it on TV when it is on, and now can be occupied on my Kindle Fire whenever I am watching something else on TV."
I'm a nanny of a 9 month old am a 2 year old this show peaks both of their interest.
My kids and I love Kai-lan.  She's a wonderful example and friend and she shows little kids how the read the emotions of themselves and friends and figure out how to work together and be a wonderful friend!
The show is great.  But my granddaughter ordered this automatically without my permission.  I have since learned how to block ordering.  All she had to do was press watch this now - and I payed  She just pressed buttons and watched these shows all day long.  The shows kept her occupied and she wanted more and more
"My four year old loves this show. It teaches a lot about getting along. There is always a moral to every story about sharing, getting along, or being a good friend. My daughter is four and she absolutely loves this show. I don't have to worry about what she is going to hear while she is watching it alone."
"My son is 9 years old and LOVES this show. The humor is on several levels so that not only does he get a good laugh but so do his father and I. These are wacky animals who get into lots of trouble, but friendship always pulls them through at the end. We recommend it whole heartedly."
My 5 year old just loves this show and is excited for each episode to see what kind of adventure is going to be happening.
"This show has very talented writers, artists and vocal actors.  It is so funny...our whole family watches it!  It really doesn't matter whether you're an adult or child, you will find it's humorous.  Because the writing is quick witted and sharp, younger children may find it confusing and some parents may think it's inappropriate at times.  The main character sounds like Ben Stiller and the very funny Wanda Sykes plays a disgruntled cow wonderfully!  Despite it's comedic nature, it still has some important lessons for us all...like lying will only bring trouble, etc. It is based on the movie and quite frankly, it rocks! 5 stars"
This cartoon is hilarious and my grandson can't get enough.  It's his favorite show and one I don't mind watching with him.
"This show is well acted, well thought out, and interesting.Our hero is an emergency room doctor who was fired after a bum rap where he had two heart patients under treatment, and one (a rich patron of the hospital) died while he attended the second.In an attempt to cheer him up, his brother takes him to the Hamptons for a party weekend. Accidental patients pop up despite his resistance to become involved as a 'private physician to the rich', and finally he gives in and agrees to stay in the area. He winds up agreeing partly because his other job opportunities appear to be blocked off for the time being, and because a local hospital administrator convinces him that he can help take some of the pressure from the local hospital staff, who are often beset by minor problems from rich and demanding people.The show is amusing, sexy, and seemingly well informed. I don't know what the market really is for private physicians, but whether or not it exists, Royal Pains sold the possible concept acceptably.In an early version of this review, I wrote that the success of the show in the long term would depend on their ability to come up with a couple of medical problems per show that aren't repetitive or trite, or making the Doc look like too much of an unbelievable miracle worker at a house call. It's a more challenging writing puzzle than a hospital based medical show, or the standard murder mystery fair that USA has also been quite successful with. I'll have to say that two years (plus) later, I can report that they were right on top of my concern, and the writers have kept the show fresh both with their continuing plots, and with interesting medical conditions that don't too often stray into either ""MacGyver"" or ""House"" territory.The character of the brother, Evan, has particularly shown well thought out and satisfying character development. At the start of the show, Evan was simply an the irritation which spurred Hank (the doctor) to start this type of practice, and provided comic relief with his wild plans for promotions. They've allowed Evan to grow into a more thoughtful and capable man, while at the same time retaining his funny side.The writers have also taken some surprising turns with continuing relationships and plots. Early on, Evan and Divya (their nurse practitioner) seemed like the perfect long term antithetical romance. While they played with that concept a bit, they never really let it bloom, eventually moving Evan into a long term and mostly very mature relationship with an heiress. Divya's character moved into and out of the prospect of consummating a marriage arranged in her childhood, and they've now given her a separate antithetical romance with a doctor on staff at the small local hospital.The addition of Henry Winkler to the cast as the brothers' long lost father was a savvy move. He adds a lot to the episodes he's in.This review has covered more material than just the first season, but that's OK. The show has been very even in quality throughout. If you like the first season, you won't regret moving on the the rest.Highly recommended."
This is the best show we have seen in a long time.  We watched all of the seasons and were sorry when we finished them.  We can't wait for the new season to start in June.
I don't think this show gets enough credit. It is really good. Serious but light! The characters are great and the story line is a very good one!
"*My husband and I had just caught up with all the past shows on White Collar and were twiddling our thumbs wondering what we could watch together. Nothing violent or gorey (my preference) and nothing too cutesy or overly romantic (his preference). This fits the bill!I I was 'iffy' with the pilot but liked the main character well enough to give it a second chance. I am glad I did. My husband and I both enjoy this show-it's funny, interesting and the characters are very engaging! Very little blood or gore-great for me since I am squeamish and don't typically watch 'doctor shows' becuase they are too graphic. This is just well-written and fun to watch! So far, nothing offense. How nice is that??"
"I love Hank and Evan. I personally think this show is different from your typical doctor shows on tv right now. Hank is a doctor that was let go from the hospital were he was currently worked, feeling depress his brother Evan who is funny in the show take him to the Hamptons where everything change for them. Hank became the go to doctor who goes to the clients rich or poor and with the help of his brother the business became Hank, MED.  It's a very good show fresh and a little different for me."
"Informative and beautiful (people, setting, cars). Interesting family interdynamics, but always respectful to the characters. I like the idea of treating people regardless of what they can pay."
"For a number of years, cable networks (USA and TNT) have been coming up with some of the best shows on television. Royal Pains is one of them. Enjoy!!!"
I enjoy watching the reruns of this show and I'm glad I purchased it. I received it in a timely manner and now can watch it over and over.
"This show probably ranks as one of the top three that USA network shows the other two of course being Burn Notice and Psych,  and while there are other doctor shows out there this one with it's cast of talented actors and actress as well as special guests make it very enjoyable and worth checking out.  While the first season only gives you twelve episodes the second season will give you more to wet your appetite with having eighteen episodes,  and yes while there are a couple that aren't that great on whole the show will probably still entertain you and your family and friends."
"This is the first season since being brought back to life by Comedy Central....All I can say is that episodes are just as awesome and funny as the Volumes 1-4....in my opinion even better...A must have for any fan...especially since it is filled with extras....if you love watching the show on TV, then you will love this DVD....the episodes never get old"
Season for went out with a bang and season five came back with a bang after 12 years off the air futurama is back and hopefully to stay for a long time. People demanded the show back and for good reason. Its awesome. if the simpsons can run for 20 season so can this. this show is awesome. I hope to see more
"Hello,  This cartoon is priceless.  The humor is very intelligent and the characters are great.  This is a little adult oriented.  Thanks."
"After a few years on hiatus Futurama returns with the same voice actors and animators, it's like it never really left.  In Season 5 the cast travel into the far future, test out new 'Eye Phones', celebrate X-mas, Robanukah and Kwanzaaa, and even visit Comic Con.As with many comedies this later season is a bit more gimmicky and outrageous than the earlier seasons (even considering it's a show set in the 31st century) it also relies more on reoccuring characters than creating new ones.But these are minor quibbles.  There are funny slapstick episodes, profound ones (the Late Philip J Fry comes immediately to mind) and character-driven ones.  It's a welcome return for a beloved show."
One of the best shows ever. I can't believe it  has been cancelled again. The DVD came in good condition and works well.
Unfortunately Futurma is following the pattern of Family Guy.  The season sets have fewer episodes and are more expensive.  I do think it was just as strong as prior seasons. My favorite was the I Phone episode.  I wish that Futurama would do more TV science fiction parody type shows.  I have to wonder if they rotate writers between the Simpsons and Family guy because the humor is very uneven in some episodes.  If the writing keeps improving I would like to see Futurama run twenty seasons like the Simpsons.
"For so long I kept hearing how Futurama was being renewed over and over but as I was about to give up hope low and behold the promise day has come,  not only am I truly happy to see the entertaining cast of Fry,  Leela,  Bender,  Dr.Zoidberg,  Hermes Conrad,  Amy Wong,  and of course the lovable absent minded Professor Hubert but they kept the original voice cast as well which is truly appreciated to both the cast and producers of the show.  All the old character quirks are alive and still running with this bumbling crew as they go from one hilarious episode to another,  and while we only get thirteen episodes with this set it still worth the price for this incredible series.  Now the only thing left to do is get the made for tv movies they made before this set which if no one has seen yet then it's another definite must for any fan of the show.  So until the next box set let this one keep us fans entertained for the wait which hopefully won't be to long..."
"""Dietary Restrictions"" is one of the best episodes of Top Chef Masters. Hubert Keller, Rick Bayless, Michael Chiarello, Art Smith, and Anita Lo face their biggest challenge yet-- catering a gluten-free,soy-free,vegan event for musician Zooey Deschanel (ofTin Man (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)and the musical groupVolume One) It forces the chefs to be creative. They can't rely on their old standbys of meat,dairy,and wheat-based pasta.Rick Bayless makes a vegan tamale--a smart idea. There is plenty of vegetable-based cooking in Mexico. Michael Chiarello finds quinoa pasta, which reminds Deschanel of home. Wheat-free pastas are probably better than the whole wheat pastas that cook strangely and don't taste all that good (Rachael Ray swears by whole wheat pasta inRachael Ray's 30-Minute Get Real Meals: Eat Healthy Without Going to Extremes) Hubert Keller,who is Gandalf-like in the kitchen, makes some vegan magic.""Dietary Restrictions"" is one of those episodes showing why Top Chef Masters is must-see TV!"
"First of all, I gotta admit: I AM A FOODIE. Give me the appropriate tools and I can follow any recipe and go anywhere.I so admire the &#34;Masters'&#34; and their abilities to be put to the ultimate test against others of their level of excellence. And they pull it off time after time.I SO enjoy watching the professionals going toe-to-toe and feeling what they feel as human beings, each with his/her own foibles and insecurities at the top level of their crafts."
"The best of the best. I loved it. However, the season was too short. I didn't see Top Chef Masters on cable. Look forward to getting the other seasons when they are placed on DVD."
Love this sitcom it is as funny as hell! Everybody should own this sitcom! Can't ask for more! Plus it came real quick and came in excellent condition!
"As a whole series Friends is 5-star entertainment all the way, although if I had one bone to pick it'd be the whole Ross/Rachel thing which is more or less a frustrating element in the show from the 6th season on.  Granted, a 'real' Ross/Rachel marriage in the 6th season would have severly limited the story line possibilities of these swinging singles in NY so perhaps I can understand the writers decision to have it this way, though it continued to grate on me even the second time I saw these.  Rachel basically broke up Ross's marriage to Emily in the 5th season (probably my favorite season) and by the end of that season they were married (albeit drunk in Las Vegas).  Rachel (who's drunken idea it was to get married in the first place - this after she breaks up his marriage to Emily) wants an unwilling Ross to annul the marriage.  And thus the frustration begins.  It doesn't end there however.  The audaciousness continues when the writers decide to develop the whole Joey/Rachel romance.  The seasons (season 10 included) continue to be funny and entertaining in spite of this development, but I must say that while it creates intrigue (through scandal) for the audience, it somewhat mars that audiences love for Rachel and even Joey as they fall into this state of affairs.  Joey, who chastised Chandler for getting involved with one of his girlfriends of like 3 weeks or something!  In terms of generating interest for the show, it works, though watching these a second time I am still struck by what an unappealing light the storyline puts both Rachel and then Joey in, as the story continues.  How can the audience forget the first time Rachel and Ross kissed in the coffee house (way back in season 2) or Ross's unfailing love for her thoughout his life basically.  And then to have Joey and Rachel live together with a complacent Ross standing by?  Ross whose child Rachel has had?  And Joey, one of Ross's best friends?  It's disgusting!  Well, of course that's TV land, and it worked for soap operas, so might as well work for Friends.  This is a great show, but I can't help but lament lost love, traitorous lovers and best friends as I enjoy the laughs!  Poor Ross, I would think.  But then again, Ross would let it go when he should have held on, and would hold on when he should have let go.  The stupidity of Ross?  Or the downright cunning of those &$@#$%@ writers."
"It's been a few years now, and I haven't heard that theme song on the radio since forever. But, as more and more time pass from when Friends ended, I find myself popping my Friends dvd collection in my player on a regular basis. Despite some promising television shows currently on air, there's still no substitution for Friends. To be honest, I now can't stand watching the Friends episodes when shown on TBS or the WB because of the commercials and the shortened scenes.Friends: The Complete Tenth Season is a shortened season, only having 17 episodes. The famous cast, immersed in other acting projects, still found enough time in their hectic schedule to put together a fitting capper on what has been an all-time classic sitcom. Thru the course of season 10, we witness the ascension and abrupt demise of the Rachel-Joey romance, the end of Ross's relationship with Charlie, Monica and Chandler's struggles to adopt a baby, Phoebe's marriage, Phoebe's choice of her new name (Princess Consuela Banana-Hammock) and Mike's retaliatory new monicker (Crapbag - first name ""Crap,"" last name ""Bag""), Chandler and Monica's decision to move to the suburbs, Rachel's new job offer, and, at last, the resolution of the Ross and Rachel off-again, on-again romance.There's really no need to go into the outstanding chemistry of the regulars. The cast is luminous and knowing that this is the last season lends a certain bittersweet tang to their acting. A few standout scenes for me: Swhimmer's hilarious performances in ""The One Where Ross is Fine"" and ""The One with Ross's Tan,"" Matt Perry's heartfelt speech to Erica at the end of ""The One with the Birth Mother,"" and the whole cast's emotional performance in ""The One with Rachel's Going Away Party"" and ""The Last One.""Some episodes did disappoint. I didn't find Danny DeVito particularly funny in ""The One Where the Stripper Cries"" while ""The One with the Late Thanksgiving"" did not live up to the quality of the other classic Thanksgiving episodes.The reassuring, always welcome presences of Elliot Gould, Christina Pickles, Maggie Wheeler, Giovanni Ribisi, and Paul Rudd are felt as they all show up for a final bow, while the unheralded James Michael Tyler as Gunther finally reveals his affections for Rachel. The guest stars are ho-hum this time. Christina Applegate (not as memorable here as her last stint), Dakota Fanning, Selma Blair, Greg Kinnear, Danny DeVito, and Aisha Tyler don't particularly contribute anything of note to the proceedings. However, Anna Faris is great as the pregnant, kinda clueless Erica, while Jennifer Coolidge is funny enough in her role as the obnoxious Amanda Buffamonteezi that she got a regular role in Joey.This time, there's no shortchanging the special features: teary-eyed episode commentary by the producers and director on ""The One  with the Late Thanksgiving,"" ""The One Where the Stripper Cries,"" and ""The Last One."" The 4th disc is devoted entirely to extra features: Friends Final Thoughts: the cast and producers reflect during their final days at work and after series production ends, Gag Reels for Seasons 1-4 and Season 10, Friends of Friends video guestbook with Aisha Tyler, Paul Rudd, and Christina Applegate, a Joey Joey music video, and a short cast & crew list.I grew up on Friends, which to this day continues to be my ""comfort food"" of television. And to this day, I still miss these six characters. When I'm bored or feeling down, I pop in any one of the 10 seasons and my mood inevitably improves. I can't help but feel that, somewhere, Ross and Rachel, Monica and Chandler, Joey and Phoebe are still hanging out together, hanging out with friends."
"Throughout its phenomenal 1994-2004 run on NBC, FRIENDS demonstrated that familiarity doesn't always breed contempt, but isn't it nice that even after 10 years, we could still learn something new about these intimately observed characters?Tidbits revealed in the episode &#34;The One Where the Stripper Cries&#34;: Ross (David Schwimmer) and Monica (Courtney Cox) used to entertain at family gatherings as Donny and Marie; (&#34;Oh God, that's right,&#34; remembers Rachel. &#34;I blocked that out.&#34;) and Chandler (Matthew Perry) kissed Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) at a college party in the 1980s. The best was saved for &#34;The Last One&#34;: At one time, Ross (David Schwimmer) pursued being a professional dancer (&#34;Do you realize we almost made it 10 years without that coming up?,&#34; he remarks).This 2003-04 Season is all about life changes and closure. Monica and Chandler buy a house and make plans to adopt a baby. Once New Age free spirit Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) gets married. Rachel is offered a job in Paris, prompting Ross to finally proclaim his love. Two of Friends's most invaluable players are granted worthy send-offs.Janice (Maggie Wheeler) resurfaces as a prospective homebuyer in the house next door to Monica and Chandler in &#34;The One Where Estelle Dies,&#34; and Central Perk fixture Gunther (James Michael Tyler) at last professes his adoration of Rachel in &#34;The Last One.&#34;MARRIED WITH CHILDREN's Christina Applegate makes a welcome return in &#34;The One Where Rachel's Sister Babysits&#34; and Danny DeVito is the unlikely and very temperamental stripper in &#34;The One Where the Stripper Cries.&#34;Greg Kinnear is at his smarmy best as Ross's new girlfriend's Nobel-prize-winning ex-boyfriend in &#34;The One with Ross' Grant.&#34; Dakota Fanning has a sweet scene with Joey (Matt LeBlanc) in &#34;The One with Princess Consuela&#34; and Anna Faris joins Paul Rudd (Phoebe's husband Mike, a.k.a. Crap Bag in &#34;Princess Consuela&#34;) as a recurring cast member in &#34;The One with the Birth Mother.&#34;FRIENDS 10th and final season quickly recovers from the Joey-Rachel misstep to find its consistent and satisfying groove. As each Friend turns in their key to the apartment each had shared at one time or another over the past 10 years in &#34;The Last One,&#34; could Friends end on a happier or more poignant note?This final addition to the FRIENDS DVD library, too, rises to the momentous occasion with a more generous package of features, including a lengthy gag reel and reflections from the ensemble.The worldwide smash-hit comedy returns for a 10th Season! For a hilarious look at dating and working in the big city, delve into the hearts and minds of 6 friends living in New York City as they explore the anxieties and absurdities of adulthood.During this exciting time when everything seems possible, even marriage, parenthood and career moves, they know they will always face the future together--because they've got Friends.This 2003-2004 Season of FRIENDS also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 31 going on 32 years old when I was engaged to be married to my wife and when we had all those fiscal budget cuts going on back then from the recession we had in 2003-2004 when George Bush, Jr. was our president."
I purchased all the seasons before I saw 1 was on Prime. They used to be streaming on Netflix & then went away. My daughter loves this show. She does the dancey dance & Biz's beat of the day. She's obsessed.
"Our toddler loves YGG. The music is fun for her and she loves to dance. Her favorite segment is Super Music Friends Show, and the Dancey Dance segment. Neither of us are big fans of Super Martian Robot Girl. I really don't get those... they seem odd and shallow and non-educational. This is my toddler's favorite show and she knows some of the songs by heart, and I do too since she likes to ask me to sing &#34;Gabba songs&#34; to her at bedtime.Her favorite episodes from Season 2 are Teeth, Clean, and Space. She loves Amy Sedaris' song as the Tooth Fairy, and I thought it was funny and cute as well. We also absolutely adore the little disco chipmunk music video about brushing teeth. We sing that song to her now as a way of getting her to brush her own teeth, and it works!I think this is a great show for kids and parents. The celebrity guests help keep it from getting boring and annoying for the adults watching, and keeps things fresh and modern for the children watching."
My 2 year old loves gabba and we watch it all the time. I like the guest stars and musical guests and that they teach good social skills.
Our 2 and 3 year old love to dance and sing along with the gabba gang.  Very upbeat learning show that also teaches do's and don'ts of being a good person.
This series offers a gentle learning lesson and is a great way to entertain a toddler who likes to dance!
"Inexplicably, this is my granddaugher's favorite show.  She can watch it over and over.  She's entranced by the characters and dances to the music.  It never gets old for her.  No other kids show does that for her."
My sons watch this episode over and over again. We all dance and sing to Yo Gabba Gabba every day. Thanks to a friend that referred me !
For the record we wish Yo Gaba Gaba had been around when our 16 year old was born. It is a great show for the kids!
Great show witg lessons for the young and old... Please thank you magic magic magic
"This is by far the strangest show I've ever seen, but my preschool childstill loves it. This is the best Season out of the 3-4. More adventure,more music. I thought it was hilarious to choose the character with one eye (Muno)to be the one to get glasses and a contact lens.Weather, Band, Dress Up and Birthday episodes are personal (unanimous) favorites."
Strange..but good clean toddler mesmerizing fun. The social skill focused topic is nice and he dances to the retro neuvo eclectic music.
"My daughter loves Yo Gabba Gabba! I like they use children of all ethnicities, physical capabilities, and people of all shapes and sizes. I feels its important to familiarize children with this at an early age so there's not as much stigma attached to being different."
"Nice production, average acting, worthy of a viewer's time. Teeny Holly adds much to make this series fun to view."
"During the first season - and even though I saw the mature audience rating - I was a little shocked at the material. BUT ..by the time I got to season 3, I felt tied in to the characters and was rooting for Grace to face her demons. Earl is my new favorite angel!!! I later watched all of the seasons available and was sad to see it end."
Another tv show that didnt last long enough and was fun to watch. Yet crap like Survivor and House Whores of Beverly Hills go on for years and years. Our society is doomed.
"A fantastic series that could have gone on for years, by my wishful thinking. What a marvelous cast filled the screen with such raw honesty."
What an incredible movie. I was pleased with the story line and the relationships he developed (even if he wanted or not) with the other characters.  Viewers will identify with any of the characters.  Sorry no spoilers here.  Highly recomended!
"THE ANSWER MAN is that rare film that combines good, quiet humor with class and a deep moral lesson. Think that's easy? Try to think of at least one title with which to compare this film.It's been 20 years since Arlen Faber (a brilliant Jeff Daniels) has published his magnum opus book, ""Me and God"" (the title should have been a big red flag all by itself). Trouble is, though Faber is globally revered and ""has cornered 10% of the God market"", he's a tourettic, reclusive a-hole who desperately needs the simplest answers for himself.With his back thrown completely out one day, after having spent possibly 24 hours on the floor, Faber literally crawls to his local neighborhood chiropractor, the dingy Elizabeth (Lauren Graham). She heals him rather rapidly and he falls for her. Not long after this, Faber encounters Kris Lucas (the beautiful Lou Taylor Pucci, who has the eyes/lashes of Elizabeth Taylor and is best known for his title-role in 2005's THUMBSUCKER), a forlorn recovering alcoholic bookstore owner. It is totally hilarious to watch the running side-line story of Faber trying to return 50 or 60 self-help books, and Lucas refusing them.A most hilarious scene with Faber in disguise, furiously shelving the books Lucas cannot buy back, results in Lucas catching hold of Faber's coat. Realizing who the mystery grouch is, Lucas blackmails him: Lucas will take back 5 books in exchange for the answer to one vital question. IN the end, Faber is helping Lucas because he wants to help this sweet, likeable boy.Faber is not only a lost man in pain, he is a foul-tempered, foul-mouthed sad soul who cannot deal well with people. On one level he is clearly tired of everyone thinking he is the Answer Man. As a priest, I know the feeling. As a flawed, ordinary man, I can identify with both Faber and Kris Lucas--their pain, frailty and vulnerability. They never really connect because they are the same man at different ages.Get this lovely, gentle and hilarious film--and find out the real meaning of life."
"Answer Manmanages to be both philosophically deep and lightheartedly funny at the same time. If you want to see a romantic comedy,Answer Manworks well. It has some funny scenes (including Jeff Daniels' monster collection) and the usual awkward romance. However, if you also like pondering the BIG questions,Answer Manprovides some interesting food for thought. It doesn't so much provide any meaningful answers as to suggest where to look for questions. Perhaps most important question is whether our lives are shaped by our choices or events that happen to us - or both."
"Was unsure when I purchased the DVD what to expect.  With real joy I can say that it was worth every cent and I have already watched it several times.  The Storyline kept me interested and I loved the two main actors. (Gilmore Girls, the mother) one of my favourite series.  Anway If you are unsure then try it I think most people will be very pleased, I was.  With the extras along comes a commentary and I am watching it now and it sounds like they had a great time filming this movie.  Enjoy."
Always enjoy any movie with Jeff Daniels. He didn't disappoint me with Answer Man.  This a great feel good chick flick.
"I read the synopsis for this movie and it sounded somewhat intriging so decided to try it.  Luckily I'm a Prime member and this movie was FREE, which is always a good thing.  I was surprisingly entertained by the story line and the acting was excellent.  Character development was top notch.  The boy who plays Alex was a good little actor and he shines in his role.  I highly recommend this movie.  Even though it's a 'chick flick' for the most part, it shows how we are all imperfect people stuggling to find our place in the world and how our lives are improved by our caring for other people.  Enjoy!"
"I love this show and hope it comes back for a second season. The premise will be familiar to readers of paranormal romances--a woman dies unexpectedly and comes back in another form that gives her a new perspective on life, society, romance, and, ultimately, her own self.In this case, the diva that drops dead is a shallow, self-absorbed, not all that bright, but not mean, hot blond with a hot lawyer fiance. Refusing to accept death, she defiantly presses a ""return"" button while being processed in the afterlife, and whammo, she's back on earth, resuscitated in the body of a very smart, but very chubby brunette lawyer ( looks reminiscent of Delta Burke, but less kittenish).And off we go. Deb, the dead diva, has to adapt to a new reality as Lane-Bryant-clad plus-size plain Jane. She has her own personality with Jane's brain--so she has a boatload of legal know-how. And, oh oh, her fiance is now a lawyer at Jane's firm. Another female lawyer--one with a slim physique and icy demeanor and high-level ambition that contrasts with Janes's plumpness and subdued prettiness and bit of Deb-ditziness. They sometimes clash, sometimes cooperate, and they are each refining the other, which is cool to watch. Everyone is fated to learn and grow.The humor and drama are well-balanced, and it's fun to see Margaret Cho as the deadpanning snarky but capable assistant to Jane. The actor who plays Deb's fiance is very appealing and quite handsome (reminds me of the late Edward Albert when he was young with a dash of that guy who was Quentin in DARK SHADOWS, for those who remember). He effectively conveys his loss of Deb as heartrending, and his moments with Jane (where they build a friendship) are so touching and lovely, that I long for the next one where they sit together intimately.There are shades of LEGALLY BLONDE (with Deb/Jane as a sort of Elle, but with the blonde super-fashionista on the inside). Others refer to Ally McBeal, but this show seems to have a kinder heart and less cynicism than that one.The guest stars in this first season have been a hoot, including Rosie O'Donnell as a judge, Liza Minelli with Delta Burke as feuding sisters, and Paula Abdul.It may not be a ground-breaking or uberbrilliant show, but I always look forward to it and my hubby likes to watch with me, too. It's fun, it's got romance, and the actress who plays Jane/Deb is very appealing and likable, with an expressive voice and a wonderful ability to switch deftly from ditzy Deb to on-the-job Jane---and you root for her to win her cases and, we hope, get her man...back!Thumbs up."
This is a show I got hooked on.  A co worker suggested it to me but then I only downloaded the pilot and didn't watch if for over a month. I was bored one day and decided to watch it. I was hooked after that.  I watched every season so far.
"The premise is that a brainless, model, Deb, accidentally dies, presses a button and is accidentally sent back to earth. Unfortunately, she's sent back in the body of an overweight lawyer, Jane, who was a good person (I know a lawyer that was a good person).The main actress, Brooke Elliott does a great job playing a woman who still sees herself as a model living in a world that perceives her as overweight lawyer; seeing her character evolve from a self indulgent model into someone building a conscious is entertaining. She is forced into ethical dilemmas weekly that are funny, sad, or sometimes touching. There are also plenty of ""big name"" special guest stars playing some really funny characters.Truthfully, with the plot I'm surprised this isn't just another fluff show but it isn't. This show leaves you feeling good about the world, hopeful; I don't know how but it does.I guess I should add that the first couple of shows aren't as good as the later shows but they lay the ground work, so you should watch them knowing that the show turns into something special quickly."
"I searched Dylan McDermott and this series is there under prime. It is a good, fast paced very well written and acted crime series.Their methods aren't the &#34;norm&#34;, but that's why its dark blue.Definitely worth watching!"
A well made show with action and thought. One that is well worth watching. I would recommend it very highly.
"A great show and team, I was not sure what to expect when I started watching dark blue, The Shield it isn't but it can stand on it's own with the team going undercover with each mission. It's basically a special group of cops picked because of what they bring to the table they go undercover each episode to bring down the bad guys."
"This show is very intriguing and kept my interest, which is saying a lot for me. It takes a good story line and great acting to keep my interest and this show has both of those. I recommend this show."
Very entertaining great cast slow past but hits the mark at the end and makes you wish that they kept it on tv.
"You really have to pay attention to what you see and hear in order to follow the very-well-written and acted drama.  Having driven in Los Angeles for many years, I don't quite buy the small amount of time it takes for the &#34;good guys&#34; to get from point A to point B."
"well, can't stop watching this DARK BLUE--Mr Marshall-Greenand the other actors really are so believable---and good--intheir lives.  Just so sorry cant watch a 3rd season--damn!!"
"Only watched a few episodes so far, like watching &#34;John Shepherd&#34; from Stargate Atlantis as the main character.  Good show though, I'm definitely hooked."
I would recommend the show to anyone who has enjoyed the gritty cop shows of the past as well as newer stuff because it is well done with good cast and sequencing.
"So far so good. The video quality is excellent, and the acting is just as good. The plots keep you interested long enough to get you caught up."
"My husband and I LOVE the dirty job series. If your not familiar with it, the title pretty much sums it up.  The host of the show Mike Rowe (spelling?) is a quick thinking personable guy who is sent across America (and beyond )to spend the day with people who have jobs that most people didn't even know existed. It's really entertaining and the chemistry between Mike, his crew and guests is really funny!"
"One of the best there is.  His voice is as well known as his face!He is not only a wonderful presenter. (his charm is as important as his voice), but also a great human being.  Go ahead.  Research him!"
"I have loved spongebob since it began to air in 2001, season 7 is pretty good, the first 5 are my favorite"
"For over a decade, ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" has become such a tremendous hit for Nickelodeon and an animated series that many children have grown up with. A popular franchise which includes video games, the character featured on a variety of food products, toys, health-related items and more.Needless to say, ""SpongeBob SquarePants"", although not a series shown on broadcast television, has managed to become a character that is part of American pop culture and still shows no signs of waning, especially with a new group of young viewers every year.With the release of ""SpongeBob SquarePants: Season 6, Volume 1' last December, many have been patiently waiting for the second volume to be released and now it's here, just in time for the holidays.Instead of breaking the seasons in half with two volumes, this time around, Nickelodeon has given us a complete season set with ""SpongeBob SquarePants:Complete Seventh Season"" features 50 mini-episodes (9 hours) which aired on Nickelodeon from July 2009 through June 2011.

Typically, Nickelodeon has split the season sets in half but this time around, it's nice to know all episodes from season seven are on this four-DVD set release.Since the debut of ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" back in 1999, the series hasn't let up in terms of storytelling and continues to raise the bar for wacky, embarrassing and even moronic moments for SpongeBob, Patrick and friends.My home is ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" mania for my eight-year-old. For the past three years, he has been a big fan of the animated series and has wanted everything that the character is featured on, may it be yogurt to toothpaste, he is a SpongeBob maniac and thus, he was excited when I watched this DVD alongside with him. I can't help but think that if my son is this way, I can imagine how in the last decade, parents had to deal with their children loving this animated series and wanting SpongeBob this and SpongeBob that.  My wife and I have found the ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" to be a hilarious and fun series. Especially when interacting with your kids, especially with the family singing along with the theme song.With that being said, there are some mannerisms that children may repeat and may not be as pleasant.  So, if your kids pick up some words such as ""moron"" or things that Squidward uses to refer to SpongeBob and Patrick, that is where parents will probably want to step in.And as many wonder if a season that has gone so long with many episodes can hit a wall of mundane storylines, so far the writers have been good in creating hilarious, fun and crazy episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants from beginning to the present with this seventh season.  From SpongeBob becoming a model, Mrs. Puff working during the summer at the Krusty Krab, Plankton trying to do all he can to steal the recipe for the Krabby Patty and many, many more crazy episodes.As for the DVD itself, it's a pretty solid DVD featuring plenty of episodes and these newer episodes definitely look better in quality compared to its older season counterpars. Animation is cleaner and more vibrant. For those who own the previous DVD releases of ""SpongeBob SquarePants: Legends of Bikini Bottom"", ""SpongeBob Square Pants: The Great Patty Caper"" and ""SpongeBob SquarePants: Heroes of Bikini Bottom"" will get a rehash of the same episodes featured on this DVD box set from those DVD releases but still, where most DVD releases come with six mini-episodes, ""SpongeBob SquarePants: Complete Seventh Season"" comes with 50 mini-episodes and you also get a good number of animated short special features included as well.If you are a parent or grandparent, with the holidays coming up and are looking for animated DVD's for the children (with many episodes) to keep them busy at home or during long commutes, ""SpongeBob SquarePants: Complete Seventh Season"" will no doubt keep them entertained. And if there is one thing I have learned with my child and also nephews, no matter how many times they have watched these episodes, they don't get bored by it.Overall, these new episodes are safe and parents don't need to worry about anything negative. Although, there are some words some children may pickup from the series but for the most part, these episodes are safe for children and for seven seasons now, the ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" series has been entertaining many children all world.And the fact that you get a full season's worth of episodes instead of a season broken in half is a big deal for many fans and I hope it stays that way!If your a parent or grandparent of children who love ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" or just a young fan at heart, ""SpongeBob SquarePants: Complete Seventh Season"" is definitely worth picking up!"
My grandkids love the cartoon and best of all I don't mind them watching it.  It doesn't get to me like some of the other children's programming.  (If I ever win the lottery I will buy the rights to Barney and burn every episode.)
"I may not personally like it, but my kids sure do! Definitely keeps them entertained and the silly songs stuck in their heads :)"
"Gotta love the sponge Bob, great show, it's awesome how the humor can make kids laugh and older, adult kids laugh even harder.Just a great show."
I watch it to lull me to sleep. Since when my boy was little we use to watch together on couch and fall asleep.
"I have two preschool boys and they really enjoy Spongebob and all the crazy things he gets into.  However, some episodes seem to be too physical, and the boys begin wrestling and get over stimulated."
This is a good show. I would rather watch something that showed a case solved then one that wasn't solved
Just watched several episodes and the layout of the factors in the crime draw one in to try to figure out who did it. I will watch more!
I like this series because of the same reason I liked to watch the other ones. How they solve the cases
I find true crime and true life events to be interesting and love watching them while my husband watches other things.
Solved is worth watching if you love real crime shows. Discovery does them with real compassion but worth watching. I love the fact that this is a show that the case is solved and does not leave you hanging. Great reality show !
"A different type of crime show that makes you feel a part of the investigation.  I especially respond to the interviews with relatives and friends of the victim/s.  Best of all, at the end of the broadcast, the episode completes with an actual ending."
"If you've chosen to watch this, you know what you're expecting and it will not disappoint; it goes into good detail on a particular crime that was unsolved for a while, then walks you through the painstaking process of law enforcement agents, forensics experts, and other individuals who teamed together to solve a crime."
"&#34;Solved&#34; is one of their better channels on ID channel. However, I like them all. Anyone who wants to know the true dark side of  sociopaths in society (U.S.)."
"I really loved this series and wanted very much to see more! I got very interested in the characters and wanted to see how they faired once they decided not to trust the government and go off on their own.When they were sailing down the river pass the house that they thought they would inhabit, I wondered what happen to them???I hope it picks up with these survivors of that experience in a new series?This review is for all of the episodes of the Colony that has been put out so far...!"
This series is more realistic them I though it would.  Certainly worth the 42 minutes to watch each episode. Get's you to thinking about the possibility it could be you!!!!!
I enjoyed the show. It was food for thought. It's uplifting to see what a groupis capable of under adverse  conditions.
"World's Greatest Dad is honestly NOTHING like I expected.  I thought it was your typical ""Angry teenage son hates father/son and father eventually bond"" type storyline, but it's nothing of the sorts.I really don't want to spoil the storyline because it's important NOT to know what happens during the second half.What you definitely need to know is that the first half is extremely vulgar thanks to Robin William's son who acts completely obnoxious towards his father, his friends, his teachers and the other kids at school.  Basically he has no manners whatsoever, and what's funny about the whole thing is how Robin Williams father character appears to let everything he does go by without *any* repercussions.However, something extremely shocking about halfway through the film completely changes the direction of the storyline.  I don't want to reveal what exactly it is that happens, but trust me, you probably won't see it coming.  Let's just say, it's at THIS point that Robin Williams becomes the main character and gets the opportunity to live out a life-long dream of his.So I'd say World's Greatest Dad has a perfect balance of drama and comedy elements.  The comedy segments are unintentionally funny perhaps because you shouldn't find them funny (even though you can't help but smile at least) and the drama segments are a big joke thanks to the storyline.Overall, well let's be honest- I've never seen a film like this before, haha.  Whoever came up with such an unusual and shocking idea for a storyline deserves a raise!"
"Quirky,Cult-Classic movie that is expected of and from Robin Williams!Deep and involving sometimes,but otherwise real and funny/dark most times!Loved it!"
Robin williams is awesome in this movie. His comic genius never fails. This is a very good movie. You can never go wron with robin williams. If you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
"I hated Kyle so much and then when his dad (Robin Williams) wrote and published Kyle's journal, I almost like Kyle like everyone else!  It's a well written script with awesome actors.  You MUST give it a chance!"
"It could be my Indian upbringing but for some reason I always feel at home when I watch Robin Williams. It could be the kindness in his eyes or the fragrance his happiness illuminates but he truly is a remarkable actor. In WGD, he does prove to me that even at 59, he remains one of the world's greatest actors.This film is for the morally tweaked, definitely not for those who live by calling everything mundane. It's funny, it's teary, it's funny, it is my film of the month. Do watch and share the word."
"The first half of this movie you're left wondering why RW is such a whimp.If I had a kid like that, I would smack the **** out of him so others wouldn't have to put up with him.Fortunately, that didn't happen.After all the negativity that RW had to put up with, he takes a frown & turns it upside down.The movie centers around sex, & there are some very awkward scenes that are hilarious.If you need a good laugh, this is it.You end up knowing more about what's going on than the people in the movie.RW was the World's Greatest Dad for putting up with his kid, then taking care of business.You'll know the scene when you watch it."
"Once again Bobcat has show his tallents here with a heart wrenching story of a father and son that just don't understand one another and the heart aches they go through for being an outcast and being different. Then when a accidental tragedy happens to the son, the father she just how fake people can be and pretty much goes with the flow until he can't take it anymore and puts everyone in their place with the TRUTH!!!. AAA+++"
This is a great movie that makes a statement about life and how the people we idolize are complete fabrications.  In the movie the father comes clean yet in real life most do not and take the money. A must see movie that makes you think.
For a Free Prime I couldn't believe how good this movie was.  Lots of suspense all the way through.  Good actors and acting.  A+
i am disappointed on how they ended the show.  i still love the show the last season in the show.  check it out.
"love the series! and what's better is being able to watch them all on prime without interruption! Now, I sadly wait for the next series...."
"In an odd dreamlike stetting, Hiro must defend his actions and prove that he isn't in fact a villain as characters from his past cast doubt on his actions and the often unexpected outcomes. The stakes are high as Hiro is fighting for his life in the real world as well.This is an enjoyable episode that should be seen by fans of the series.Highly Recommended!CFH"
"I just read that Heroes has been canceled.  I'm sad to see the show go.  I must admit that I'd never heard of the show until a couple of months ago, and spent the last couple of months watching all the episodes back to back.  I was hooked after watching season one, disappointed that season two was so short (writer's strike), season three picked things up again, and season four had it's share of surprises.I really loved how the show gave flesh and bone to the characters, and even switched them from good, to bad, to good again.  The cast was fantastic, all of them.  And, as for Sylar (Zacary Quinto), he was one of the creepiest villains I've ever seen on the screen.  I wouldn't want to run into him on the street.This show has been some of the most engaging television I've seen in ages.My thanks to all who brought us this remarkable show."
"The addition of Robert Knepper, with his evil intentions, and the entire carnival cast was a master stroke.... kudos to the writers...."
I love this series ... keeps me on the edge of my seat ! Can hardly wait for the next series :-)
"This was a new kind of series that I was sure would last many seasons but alas, it was pulled and we will never get to see an ending.I would put this up there with the X-Files as far as new thinking and breaking new ground in a series. We have more than enough series about police, attorneys, and spies and so this was a very welcome break in that mundane dribble that infests the cable channels now.A shame, real shame, to cut a series like this without giving closure to the loyal fans that stood by it all those years."
"It's a good episode. I didn't have any problem with the ending. However, I do find it disappointing when networks will command what should be aired and what shouldn't. Especially when networks choose to air worse shows then the good shows that want to be on. Stupider still, why bother cutting off other shows when you can just add shows to the network. I mean, how did we get more channels in the first place? We expanded. So, I don't see the problem. The only problem I see is that no one is really doing anything to expand and allow new things.With shows getting less and less imaginative, I think preventing Heroes from continuing was a horrible choice. Whilst people may like a lot of the new series airing today, it's sad that better series' will not get to air because people won't let them.I loved this series, very creative, very realistic. I wish the creators had been allowed to go on, as I know people did.Maybe in the years to come, hopefully, something can change and allow more series' to air then already are. Putting a restriction on the imagination is a bad thing, not a good thing. If all your interest is money, then look around, good series' make money. Preventing them is to prevent the good things to come off of those things your preventing.Anyways, I know this is off topic. Sorry about that.I hope, in the future, this problem can go away.I loved this series. I loved how the heroes managed to work in order to prevent and do things in a way that kept us interested. The Samuel element was a nice touch; showing the art of manipulation. Also, getting to know Noah Bennett was a nice touch as we gradually got to know him as the series went along; he was always the man of mystery. Everything went well. However, I'll admit, Clair's final act, in this series, was an interesting element. She decided to override her father's judgement in order to try to show the world that there were people that were different than them, possessing special abilities. This, when you look at it, can make you look back to the time when the government had soldiers tracking down the ""Specials,"" as I'll call them. It makes you think hard on Clair's judgement.That's probably the hard part about writing a story, you have to analyze and analyze in order to think of the best thing to fit what should be, in a good story. This element, that I just listed (Clair's decision), fit Clair pretty well as she's been one to go outside what people wanted of her for a while. She's not usually the one to completely follow orders. So, this made her decision able to fit the circumstances. Really, I can't read Clair, the best, but I think the final scene went well.Anyway, the series was great. I know people have been getting on the things surrounding Sylar, but honestly, I think all the things that happened to him in this season really went well. It all fit very well, and I actually enjoyed seeing the new Sylar. The reactions of people around him, and him, went well.So, great series."
I have been a heroes fan for a long time. I was very upset that the seaon ended and that they did not pick up another season. This leaves you hung.
For a scifi type movies it seems almost real.  I would like to see more video entertainment as well done.
"i wanted to see how it all ended, but certainly the earlier volumes were better. not sure if the writers changed or what happened."
I really enjoy heroes I am NOT a sci-fi fan but this was absolutely a great movie.  I am wstching it again.
I choose this rating cuz this season of heroes was amazing. the episodes never messed up with amazon and everything went just fine I would recommend this show to everyone
love this show. too bad this is the last season. love watching it anytime I want too. I love it
"This was one of my favorite shows, but I truly feel that the writers strike during the second season of the show did it in. It never regained its mojo."
"Oh my goodness.  I truly enjoyed this series.  I hope, hope, hope they continue on with Heroes.  I was lost when I watched the last episode."
"I just love the series Heroes and have all of their seasons, it a great TV Show which I highly recommendpeople to see it! But to Understand it, you will have to start out watching the Seasons in order i.e. do notwatch season 2 without watching season 1 First, or you will have problems figuring out who's the good guysand who's the bad guys!  Same thing with seasons 3 and 4"
"This was a pretty good series, complex, interesting characters and reasonably okay plot line.  Heroes.  We need more like it."
"This is one of the best done and most unique re-imaginings of superman. No fan of the DC Universe can safely continue to call themselves fans without seeing what would of happened if superman landed 8 hours later in earths rotation, thus landing in the USSR instead of the U.S.A. The ending of this tale also makes up for any of the small details one might quibble about when taking off stars. The only issue, which isn't much of an issue since it comes with the genre is that fact that the comics and ""in motion"" but are yet in still motion, while I've seen other ""motion"" comics with them putting the added effort of lip movement and believable motion amongst the characters."
"I can't believe this program was canceled before closure. I had never heard of the show, but came across it here on Amazon. It was a very good show, I watched every episode. Excellent FX. Good stories. Good actors (great casting). This show had everything going for it."
"I watched this series on telly initially and then when it became available bought the dvd to see the bits I missed. I was glad I did.At its heart this show is about eight astronauts on a round the solar system mission of exploration, pitting the immesity of their grand voyage of discovery against their own personal failings. And every one of those men and women is deeply flawed in some way, scarred by events in their past. And though I find it hard to conceive of NASA ever putting a crew together for that sort of mission with such flaws, this makes for riveting story telling.While there are a lot of sci fi elements to the story as you would expect, and I love the detail that has gone into the ship design etc, this is also a very human drama. And there is of course a mystery behind the entire voyage that is slowly revealed as they set off for their first destination - Venus. (And for once it was good to see the planet realistically portrayed forthe environmental nightmare it actually is.)This show has one flaw that I imagine might annoy some - a lot of it is told in flashback. (I seem to recall complaints against a show about a bunch of plane crash survivors on a time travelling island that encountered similar resistance). However, I did not find this bothersome in any way as the flashbacks served to advance the plot.The only other flaw I can find is that it is only one season. Though initially I expect the producers were aiming at many more seasons, ratings I assume prevented that. This is a tragedy as there is so little good sci fi on telly that this show deserved to be continued. And it also means that many of the deeper mysteries about the objects the crew were sent to retrieve from each of the planets were not answered.However even knowing that this is an outstanding show with outstanding production values, a well written plot, good acting and an intriguing mystery.I really loved it."
"I find myself no longer watching any new shows until they are established - with one exception - Dollhouse, and you know how well that ended. We stumbled into Defying Gravity by mistake, since the networks refuse to advertise the truly brilliant pieces of work they unearth and, instead, push irrelevant nonsense they think the sheep will love. Dollhouse is an example of this - a show that had no advertisement behind it, started badly, but has ended with such spectacular brilliance, in my opinion, whether it is canceled or not, Joss Whedon has another win on his hands (and true Joss fans - where WERE YOU???). Defying Gravity was another wonderful nugget of sci-fi that nobody watched. I am ordering it here and hoping it has some closure because it still drifts into my head occasionally and I wonder what happened to the amazing crew on their journey. The writing started out a bit slow, there were sluggish moments, but I'd put this show up against Lost any day for acting, suspense and intelligence. It's my opinion that Hollywood would rather keep it's head immersed in political nonsense (all L&O's, anything on NBC), or the blood and gore in the many CSIs and variations thereof, than give us what we want - intelligent Sci-fi, or any program, where we can escape, and not be proselytized with their own beliefs. I'm turning more and more to shows offered up by USA, TNT, AMC, FX, HBO, SHO, and other cable networks, because they seem to ""get"" that people are getting sick of watching garbage get renewed, while the good stuff goes out with the trash. I won't even go into the now SYFY which is now giving us STARGATE Universe, a mere, horrible reflection of the brilliance of the original SG1 and Atlantis! Bring back Sci-fi and maybe I'll come back! BIG mistake not giving Defying Gravity time to develop and grow. The networks are wondering why they are losing ground. It's no mystery to me and most ""regular"" folks. After all, we're the one's watching, right?"
"I bought and watched my 8 programs, all that was available currently on Amazon.  The channel decided to cancel the program.  I don't understand their thinking.  The is a very exciting SciFi packed with loving relationships between crew menbers hoping to travel the solar system.  It's an adventure and action packed. Since Amazon is not selling the additional 5 programs that were not made available I had to search the internet until I could see them free but bad quality.  I hope Amazon makes the additional 5 shows available as I really want to buy them and watch them from my Amazon video on demand library. It's well worth the money to buy and watch the 8 shows that are currrently available."
"I'm really enjoying this show, great acting unique storyline and well developed charcters right away.  Hope this one stays around a while."
"This story is about 8 astronauts going on the first major space exploration of the solar system. Everyone, except for a very small minority see it as the heroic journey, a tribute to human achievement and curiosity. A small minority know the truth, that ""something"" not human is picking the crew and developing the mission but this is a closely guarded secrete.The show is well written. The story doesn't develop quickly but feels more like a carrot put before the horse, always just tantalizingly out of reach. This effect is well done and works mostly because each show is so rich in and of itself that it's fun instead of frustrating to wait for the show to progress.The show is also very well cast. Character development happens quickly through main plot line which is interlaced with flashbacks that open up the undercurrents to us. It doesn't take long to see the characters as multidimensional people and feel an emotional connection with them.I'm sorry to see yet another series canceled before it's time. It seems like some networks don't really get it's sci-fi audience.  It make take a few seasons to get a loyal following but once word gets out about a great sci-fi show it makes a big splash and the shows popularity can carry on for years after a show is over.  Unfortunately, as long as networks create great shows but cancel them prematurely it will give fans little reason to give the shows on their network a chance. After all, why get involved with a show that needs time to evolve if it's going to be canceled before you get to the good stuff.It's very frustrating to see a show with so much potential get canceled, especially after only one season."
"Warning!  Multiple spoilers below!The bad news about DEFYING GRAVITY is that it was cancelled after its first and only season.  The good news is that the thirteen episodes making up the show are nicely self-contained and tell a coherent story that can be completely enjoyed on its own.  Telling the story of the first manned mission to Venus, the series focuses on the crew members and support team of the spaceship Antares, who we eventually learn are not going to Venus merely in order merely to explore.  The series splits its time between real time coverage of events both on the spaceship and back on earth and flashbacks to the period of time in which the selection for the Antares mission were being made.  I like that it focuses so deeply on interpersonal relationships and the development of characters.  Many of these things we learn only gradually, such as the entire meaning of one character's memories of the apparently miraculous resurrection of her German Shepherd when she was a little girl or all of the circumstances surrounding the botched abortion one of the candidates.  The story moves slowly and the show contains few big moments, but if you appreciate subtlety and elegance to explosions and shockers, this is a series that will definitely please.As a Canadian production most of the actors will be familiar from shows shot in Vancouver or elsewhere.  For instance, Ty Olsson has been in a host of series, including BSG as Captain Kelly and an hysterical turn in EUREKA as an android sheriff.  Laura Harris is a Canadian actress who has worked in Hollywood as well, most notably 24 and THE WOMEN'S MURDER CLUB, though most of her work has been in Vancouver.  She is probably best known for her marvelously nuanced performance as the sexually promiscuous thirties starlet and grim reaper Daisy Adair (she claims to have died having sex on the set of burning of Atlanta on GONE WITH THE WIND) on the TV series (though not movie) DEAD LIKE ME.  Zahf Paroo, who plays Ajay Sharma, is a character actor you see on a lot of shows like EDGEMONT, though I spotted him in a crowd scene on Caprica in the BSG miniseries and recently while rewatching DARK ANGEL I noticed him as a news anchor on a couple of episodes.  Christina Cox is a very beautiful woman with an unforgettable face who is always identifiable on any of the many shows she has appeared on.  She has long deserved a major hit series and it is unfortunate that this excellent show was not it.  The biggest name actor on the show is Ron Livingston, who plays Donner on GRAVITY, who has to live down having left two fellow crew members behind on Mars on a previous mission, a decision not made easier for him by the fact that he was ordered to do so.  Of course, knowing that, you as a viewer know that he will be put in a situation on the Venus mission where he will have an opportunity to redeem himself for that.  I loved this cast and found them believable both as a unit and as individuals.What breaks my heart about this show is how poorly promoted it was.  I actually never heard about it through any promotions and only discovered it by accident before it was too late.  I suspect the network imagined it would both be a show with stronger ratings and more of an action-packed show.  Despite being set largely in space, this is not a space opera.  Set only a few decades in the future, the technology is not greatly beyond our own.  Compared to STAR TREK the space travel seems (and is) primitive.  No warp drive.  No space aliens.  No space battles.  My one complaint with the technology on the show is that all communication with the space ship takes place live, with a character on the Antares and a character in mission control on earth having real time conversations, never talking over one another.  Heck, my friends and I talk over each other because of the lag with cell phones and VOIP.  In fact, a message broadcast from near Venus would take so long as to make any actual conversations impossible.  Communication would be more like sending e-mails to one another.There will not be a Season Two of DEFYING GRAVITY, but the single season that we do have works extremely well on its own.  We don't learn the secret of the mysterious entity that drives the entire project, but that hardly matters compared with the drama involving the characters on the ship.  At least the show's one season was a good one."
"Defying Gravity is an awesome show that mixes the foreseeable future with an alien sci-fi twist.  It's all about mystery with flashbacks to see where the characters have come from and how far they have gone.  The whole show left me on the edge of my seat and I have since re-watched the show many times over.  Its great to watch at the end of a day.  Anyway, if you're a space fan and love mystery, this is the show for you.  This show was sadly cancelled before its time.  Have no fear in buying this gem."
wow a good show. To good of a show not to have a second season or even more. I know firefly is the best show ever not to have a second season. this one is in the top 10. first 2 hours are a little slow but after that hold on.....well worth the power to run the tv. if You love science fiction you will love this
"We recently got rid of our dish and chose to try an antennae. Many of the tv shows we used to watch aren't on the locals, so we buy them here. This is a fun show due to the conflict of the main characters with a huge difference in beliefs and how to do things. Interesting mix of two different styles of survival, worth watching!"
Love my Prime membership to see this season. Wish it allowed me to see 8 & 9 but not available with prime pay only.7 is a good turn on crews. The youth get dragged over the coals to know if this is for them. Cornelia get weather tested with new captains and new crew.Never gets boring.
"The show is awesome,  the bearing sea  is a bitch of a place and Discovery has invested  heavly over the years to fine tune the cameras, crews  and  really make the show  cool. Who  would have thought that a show about crabbing would be a hit?  I like how the story lines are growing with new fleet vessels and thier crews, are a good mix  for future seasons. I  am glad they are  showing how crabbing works and how the  nuances  of that fishing  are impacted mininute by minute by nature above the ocean and  down on the floor.  I know that Discovery has trailer boats  so they are not alone  but I know they do work  hard to fil the quotas. Also I am glad that discovery are mixing in the USCG  and thier  presence in the fleet and on patrol. Very cool, glad the producers are thinking outside the box."
"this is one of our favorite shows, so thankful amazon provides it for us, great entertainment, if it weren't for amazon we would miss this show as we cut the cable cord over the summer"
This movie turned out better than I thought because the picture looked questionable as to quality of production and ideas.
"Season four is quite possibly my favorite season, although season one comes in pretty close behind. Gus seems to find his own place this season, and Shawn has a nice thing going on at the beginning and end of the season (as usual). The first episode, ""Extradition: British Columbia"" is hilareous: Shawn takes Gus on the road to Canada, where he passes himself off as Santa Barbara's head detective and Lassiter & Juliet have to play second fiddle. Then we find out the whole reason he went to Canada: it was originally a trip he had planned for Abigail. I had to watch the episode again, because suddenly a lot of the scenes took on whole new meanings.I also enjoyed ""A Very Juliet"" episode - very touching, even if it does pull Juliet and Shawn apart a bit. Perhaps that's why in Season five he sends a picture of a dog to all of Juliet's boyfriends with a message ""this is you"". Ah, the on again-off again relationship between the two.If you enjoy the series, this is another one to add."
"This show keeps getting better and better, and it's quickly becoming my number one favorite! There is, quite simply, nobody more charismatic on television than Shawn Spencer. And there's no better chemistry out there than that which exists between Shawn and Gus, the most lovable buddy duo you will ever see, in any medium.Kudos to the writers of this outlandish spoof of police procedural shows, for they have continued to come up with original ideas that engage, as the show gets into its fourth season. Rather than grow stale with time, this formula has actually continued to improve, and I can't get enough of it. Whether they're chasing down ""Stinky Pete"" with guest star Kenny Rogers through a ghost town, wrangling lyncanthropes, or wrestling baddies with the likes of John Cena (""I've never met a man too big to hide behind a plane,"" Shawn notes with wonder), the adventures of these guys are an exercise in nonstop hilarity!I look forward to blasting through the next couple of seasons and getting all caught up on this wonderful, funky, unique show... can I find the hidden pineapple in each episode?"
"Even wittier and more dangerous than the previous series, these episodes get better and better. This is a hilarious addition to the previous seasons and is a must see for anyone looking for a good laugh and a modern day Sherlock in the form of a phony psychic."
"Season 4 is as entertaining as the previous seasons were! If you like comedy combined with a little crime/mistery, then you will like PSYCH!"
I love Gus and Shawn I think it would be the coolest to just sit back and watch them work they have added so much laughter to my life and I encourage all my friends and co-workers to watch them just to get a good laugh and watch justice happen!
Psych gets better and better with each season. You won't be disappointed by collecting this series. I noticed thou for the first time that both my purchases had the words disc made in Mexico on the plastic cover-what's up with that. Either I never noticed before on all my Amazon purchases of tv shows are made in Mexico for sale in USA and Canada only????
"I think seasons 3 and 4 are the best. this is usually when a series hits its stride if its going to make it. they are funny, fun, exciting. every case has a little twist. you really want to be friends with gus and sean."
"I am a huge fan of the show, and with it rumored to be ending next year after the eighth season, having the set on DVD is a plus. It is time for it to end as the last couple of seasons haven't had that &#34;feel&#34;, but I still enjoy it."
"After four years the show is still a incredible mix of enjoyment and hilarity as you see James Roday and Dule Hill play the bumbling but highly efficient detectives solving the case for their beloved city.  The season has us rolling in laughter as well as a little bit if sadness as you see the relationship turnover for our favorite fake psychic and his girlfriend and the choices their force to make for their lives as well as their carers they've made,  we also get to see a more family oriented camaraderie between father and son in some episodes especially in the season finale as we see a return of a nemesis of Shawn and Gus seeking to play another turn of mind puzzles against them as well as their friends.  Almost all the episodes of the season four have their usual mix of hilarity and seriousness mixed in,  from a seemingly nut job who thinks he's a werewolf to a possible biological viral outbreak but no fear because our favorite dynamic duo are on the case.  The video and audio are both clean and sharp no picture distortions or audio problems with the series season set.  So for any fans of the show rejoice as we now have another season to add to our home library collection...."
"This is the best price I have found, I do check all the places and always come to my trusty amazon."
"Season 4 kept everything you love about Psych and added a lot of new wrinkles to the formula that only made it better. The season had some great plotlines like Shaun actually having a serious girlfriend. This added a great new dimension to the character as he tried to learn the ins and outs of relationships. That was a really fun idea that drove Shawn into different areas of his character. The season is notably stronger the first half but that isn't really a criticism of the second half. It's just that they felt more like a normal crime scene investigator show sometimes instead of Psych. The first half just seems to have a lot more variety. The season ended though on my favorite episode of the series ""Yin Presents."" It is the sequel to the season 3 finale and is an awesome tribute to Alfred Hitchcock. The suspense in the episode kept me on the edge of my seat and the ending is very emotional as you wonder how the trilogy will be concluded.Some other great episodes include a Jaws tribute, Shawn in the Old West, a man that is cursed, an exorcism, and even Shaun getting shot. The acting from Dule and James is always hilarious as they argue even at the most inopportune times. The DVD set itself features a few audio commentaries and every episode has a video commentary which includes the writer of the episode answering questions. These little video commentaries are a great way to see the process behind the writing of Psych and make this set even better.  If your a ""fan of delicious flavor"" then go pick this up you won't be disappointed."
"All you need to know about this episode is that when Monk is camping with a bunch of kids and Randy, he runs into a Grizzly Bear.  What does Monk do to stop the bear from eating him?  Well, he says the magic words, ""This is what happened...."""
"Monk: Season Eight, arrived very quickly and in perfect condition.  I would buy further products from this seller in the future."
"Love Monk, the best TV show. Tony Shaloub is excellent in his role, I wish they will bring this show back!!!!"
"Although I had seen season 8, I dreaded watching it because I didn't want to say bye again. Broke my heart for Monk to end but it was a great season."
"For twelve years, Adrian Monk has been hunting his wife's killer, struggling with his phobias and compulsions, and solving plenty of crimes.But now his lonely quest is finally ending. ""Monk Season Eight"" is a brilliant finale for the long-running detective series -- the writers have a whole season to wrap up plot threads, sketch out futures for the beloved characters, and introduce a final round of bizarre crimes that only the OCD detective can solve. And of course, they finally address the main mystery: who killed Monk's wife, and why?First, Monk (Tony Shalhoub) is hired by a former child star who starred in his favorite sitcom, ""The Cooper Clan"" -- and the reality might tarnish his favorite show. Among his other problems: voodoo dolls, UFOs, a Nigerian man whose wife was killed in a hit-and-run, camping trips with surly small boys, birthday parties, the murders of Dr Bell's new therapy group, a snobby theatre critic who apparently murdered someone while he was watching Julie's play, a dog Monk reluctantly adopts, and even the possible destruction of a good friend's wedding.A familiar face returns to San Francisco when Sharona (Bitty Schram) comes back to deal with her late uncle's legal issues, but Monk suspects foul play. And Monk's longstanding dream of rejoining the police force is realized, but turns out to be... less than ideal. Finally, his ongoing investigation into Trudy's death twelve years ago takes a deadly turn -- not only is someone trying to kill him now, but an old secret from years ago reveals the truth...There's a bittersweet quality to the final season of ""Monk"" -- on one hand, it's sad that the series is finally ending, and on the other hand it has some of the most particularly because it's the best season that the show has had in quite awhile. And the writers take care to wrap up various plot threads that have wound through the series (Trudy's murder, Monk's desire to rejoin the police force) and arrange futures for most of the characters.And along the way, they provide a solid string of murder mysteries -- baffling crimes, obscure clues, and new eccentricities. And while there are many bittersweet moments, especially in the last two or three episodes, the season is peppered with some comedy as well (Monk hosts a hilariously squeaky-clean bachelor party) and some deliciously hilarious dialogue (""There is no Opposite Killer! If there was, you would have been killed by a falling rocket scientist years ago!"").And as for the ending... well, it has some major shocks and plot twists, and the mystery is rather brief and simple. However, the resolution of Monk's story is intensely satisfying and leaves you feeling warm'n'fuzzy.Tony Shalhoub is, as ever, lovably oddballish as Adrian Monk; while his tragicomic performances are brilliant throughout the season, his performance in the final episode is shattering, raw and eventually uplifting. Traylor Howard, Jason Gray-Stanford and Ted Levine give solid performances (and their characters all get new romantic interests... some quite surprising!), and there are some excellent guest turns by Schram, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, and Virginia Madsen. But Shalhoub is the undisputed star of this season.It's a wrench to say goodbye to Monk and the gang after eight long years, but at least the eighth season is a brilliant farewell. Here's what happened... and here's what Monk did about it."
"I can only echo what others have said here...it was a shame that this series had to end, but what a strong final season it is.From face-eating coyotes to Monk's therapy flash cards, the STORY in each episode is the cake but the subtle, often mumbled little ""grace notes"" are the icing.There's not a bad episode in the set, but my personal favorites are:""Mr. Monk and the UFO""...just a sustained level of insanity from beginning to end, and we learn that if you die of natural causes, coyotes will eat your face and drag you several miles into the desert. A cult gathers around Monk, but even the most loyal followers soon learn that things aren't always as they seem.""Mr. Monk is Someone Else""...Monk assumes a hitman's identity and still manages to come across as Monk, doing mob hits for a living. Absolutely hilarious.""Mr. Monk Goes to Group Therapy""...I can't even touch this one without offering up spoilers, but I will just say ""watch for the flash cards."" Hector Elizondo has long been a ""deadpan comic gem"" and the dry delivery of outrageous lines ping-ponged between his character Dr. Bell and Tony Shalhoub is unforgettable.And of course, the finale. This is a wonderful set to own, and you certainly can't beat the price. Highly recommended."
I feel kind of sad that i'm already at the end of the series. I thought there was more but the last episodes have the same fun writing as the first few years.
"Monk's 8th and final is just as hilarious and entertaining as the previous seasons. Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders, with the help of his devoted Assistant, Natalie. Throughout this season, Monk serves as a bodyguard for his favorite actress, investigate a UFO sighting, goes undercover as a Mafia boss, celebrates his Birthday, receives a surprising visit from Sharona Fleming, and finally solves the murder of his wife, Trudy. It all comes down to this. I highly recommend MONK: SEASON EIGHT!!!"
I AM OCD SO I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND MONKSISSUES. LOVE THE SHOW . HAVE ALL THE SEASONS AND SO THANKFUL SINCE HE WILL NOT RETURN.
"Monk finally gets the ending he deserves.  With the return old friends, a new marriage, and one huge case to solve, Monk returns for the final time, as he searches for the man who killed his wife.  With stunning revelations being revealed and loose ends being tied up, we finally say goodbye to the world's greatest detective."
I LOVE THIS SHOW!! TONI COLETTE IS THE BEST! I RECOMMEND EVERYONE WATCH IT!!!IT'S MY NEW FAVORITE SHOW! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!
"Toni Collette (an Australian actress) does an amazing and convincing job of portraying multiple personalities ""alters"" in this dark comedy.  Toni ""Tara, Buck, Alice, & 'T'"" work alongside John Corbett fromMy Big Fat Greek Weddingas they navigate life and it's stressors.  The acting is superb and the direction and production keep the viewer coming back episode after episode.  This series is unique in that MPD or Dissociative identity disorder (DID) has never been approached before on television besides the old movie Sybil.  United States of Tara gives a much more realistic view of how a typical family might deal with this.It's dark, it's funny and I found myself watching episode after episode in almost one sitting.  Collette's portrayals are convincing and really debut her acting prowess.  For something different and oddly funny, try out this series.  With Steven Spielberg at the helm, the series really comes together."
"I fell in love with this series.  I had plans to watch an episode to see how it was, and I was hooked on the first one.  I watched the whole season in less than a week.  The characters are interesting, and the alters are pretty interesting too! Watch it...it's great!"
Great story and excellent acting. Toni Collette steals the show but John Corbett is right behind her. Love to see them both get their teeth into a really good story. Very intense. Very funny.
A great show that isn't boring because one never knows what will happen next.  And a guide said six more words are required. Toni C. does a great acting part with her many varied characters that she plays.
"The U.S. of Tara (All Seasons) was wonderful; I thoroughly enjoyed it!  Toni Collet is an incredible actor, and her supporting cast in Tara made her work on the show all the more enjoyable.  I wish Tara was still being made.  Watch the show; it's really good."
"This show revolves around the main character-Tara, who has multiple personalities. It takes a good actress to be able to pull this off convincingly but she does a great job.  One of her personalities is a guy and she even pulls that off.  I think this is an award winning show.  I'm disappointed it didn't last more than one season.  I highly recommend this show."
"I love the show, I can't believe it ended after only three seasons. I think the main actress should get an award."
This show crack my up no matter how many times I watch it. Out of all the characters buck would be my favorite.
"I have had customers asking for this set since June so I was more than happy to finally get it in this week. I cranked through the episodes in a few days and loved everything Toni Collette has made on screen here. Her performance was amazing and in the end, carries the set.The set is spanned over two discs with the both the PC and DVD supplements placed on disc 2, including:* Sitting Down with Diablo Cody, 2:30 minutes. An ambush style interview that had some candid and funny moments but was way too short.* Tara's Alters, 4 clips totaling 7 minutes. Each alter is briefly described by Collette or Corbett with Buck and Alice getting the longer cuts. T and Gimme only get a brief minute.* Tudors episode 301. That set is already available so I guess they are trying hard to push this series.* Sweepstakes entry, 3 minutes. A ad promo clip for travel to Collette's ""home town"" of Sydney. Have to admit I enjoyed seeing the luxury options available to one traveling in an Airbus 380.* Photo gallery. Some decent pics of on-set stuff, lasts a couple minutes.* Bios. Textual bios of the main cast and minds behind the show.PC extras: The disc loads a menu which forwards you to a website for the remaining extras.* Contrary to what the artwork and ads tell you the first two episodes of Season 3 Californication are here - not Season 2.* Podcast Interview with Collette, 2 minutes. Covers some more of her take on the series and characters. The other three interviews promised are not available.* On the set - not available.* Tudors Season 3, first two episodes.* ""More"" - could not find anything different.Overall, I think one would be buying this for watching the series only as the extras are short. The sound is selectable between 2.0 and 5.1 for the episodes, region coded 1, 2 discs in thin cases with episode descriptions in each. Solid acting and writing recommendation. Enjoy."
"This was so good that I spent three days just sitting there and watching the entire ...all of the seasons, non stop.  it is amazing...something new...not the same old thing.  I LOVED IT!!!!!"
I hate that this show was cancelled. It is very smart and sassy. Tim Roth is a great actor. I loved the premise for the show..
"im a late comer in most shows. but im not  wealthy so for entertainment i watch tv, and movies. and im old enough to have watched a lot over the years. there are a few key components for the making of hit show. the writing of course has to be good. but what has come with it, and this is every bit as important as the writing itself, maybe more so. and that is the people chosen to play the characters. if you look at almost any show, even sitcoms, it is the chemistry between  people that makes us drawn to the show. for example, i believe we all love the idea of friendship and find it hard to find even one person that you can fully trust and call friend through out life. shows that were hits all had good writing, sometimes not, but had people playing the characters that were really good at bringing the friendship and trust to the screen. look at happy days, lavern and shirley, seinfeld, cheers, mash, house, bones, friends, and finally nypd blue. these are only a few examples. what do they all have in common? the relationships between any two people, or in the case of friends many friendships between many people. i love nypd blue, and although the writer had a drinking problem and it did affect his writing, the people carried the show because they were so good at bringing the characters such as sipowitz and john kelley, or bobby simone. the friendships that sipowitz had over the years on that show i believe is what really draws us in. in my case, when watching i have found myself searching in my own mind the question, do i have that kind of friendship? and wanting to watch and see how they look out for one another and without almost never saying it, you know they care about each other like family. i think that is the key to any drama or sitcom for that matter. having the right actors, and their ability to bring that level of emotion and caring for each other that we all look for in our own lives. an example of this can be found in house. before the writers strike with house, it was a hit show, and winning awards. why? hugh laurie or house and his relationship with wilson, his best friend, and cuddy. then you have the supporting cast of cameron, chase, and forman. but its the relationship between house and wilson that really brings us closer and gives us the laughs we enjoy by watching, and relate to in our own lives. its the friendship, and the flirtation with cuddy, and how he interacts with his supporting cast that we have come to love. BUT, if you look at when they broke up the crew, the writers strike happend, chase, cameron, and forman had next to no time with house. also, they took away the witty exchange with wilson and cuddy. the dynamic of the show changed. the ratings dropped, people wrote and called in their fustration with the direction the show was taking. the writers essentially ruined the chemistry between the key characters. the friendships and relationships that we all related to, or hoped for in our own lives was no longer there. ratings dont lie. so, my long way of making my point is this: the show ""lie to me"" is very unique. first the writing is good. not great. i think they can improve and have a lot of material to draw off of. but the people who play the characters really make that show a hit. from day one, they have been developing the friendships and relationships between the characters and i believe as long as they keep moving in this direction it will be a great hit. the concept and or idea of the show is very unique. nothing like it before has ever hit the small screen. making my point in friendship, they even brought in the actor from ER to be like a second partner, but male not female, and you can see how they are becoming better friends and learning to trust each other.  forgive me i cant remember his name at the moment, but the lead character lightman now has a FBI guy to lean on, and you can see they felt they needed him to have that connection like they did on nypd blue. lightman has the one woman he trusts, but they oscillate between flirtation and friendship. with the FBI its two guys depending on each other. partners like you would find in any police unit. and i believe they give us all the components for a great tv series. the friendship, a unique concept in telling the truth, and the story lines in which to bring out all the things we can relate to in our own lives. plus its damn funny too. its a great cast, great idea in terms of what lightman does, and i believe if the writers keep moving forward, keep the characters growing letting us in a little at a time, and bring that friendship to the front with his FBI agent it will be on for many years to come. i love the show and plan on buying the series. five stars from me. but then im just a guy with a little too much time on my hands."
The acting and writing is GREAT!  I wish the network would renew for a 4th season.  It's about time for an INTERESTING show on TV!
"Another good TV series cancelled while still in its prime.  I'd heard nothing but good things about this series, so I watched and was NOT disappointed."
It would be a better world if we could know what someone's intentions are just by reading their expressions.  All of the actors are outstanding.  The plots are original.  Cal Lightman is a quirky character.
"We thought season one was good, but it seems like the shows continue to get even better during season two!"
It just an enjoyable series. I enjoy the concept of the series. Face reading is a very interesting plot.  Good show!
We watch all the seasons of &#34;Lie to Me&#34; and loved it!  Acting and story line great!  We highly recommend.
What a great show.  It has everything plus you are learning something as well.  It is a very interesting concept and both crew and cast do an excellent job of keeping you entertained and wanting for more.  Kudos to them all.
"22 Episodes on 6 DVD Discs, being released November 9, 2010Tim Roth continues to star as Dr. Cal Lightman on drama series, ""Lie To Me"" created by Samuel Baum about the science that goes into discovering who is lying and who is telling the truth in a variety of different situations. Dr. Lightman and his staff are hired to solve crimes, help the FBI, prosecutors, and even small ventures like which child is responsible in the classroom for a missing turtle. This ability makes him a force to be reckoned with at work and frustratingly complex at home.Tim Roth is delightfully quirky and very stubborn. His character is based off the real-life scientist, Dr. Ekman but only remotely, the two are about as different as two people can be. Lightman is divorced but has an on-again, off-again relationship with his ex-wife, the lawyer played by Jennifer Beals. His daughter, Emily is adorable and played by Hayley MacFarland. She is always in the process of proving to him how grown-up she can be by helping around the office and asking to be treated as a mature adult even while trying to get her driver's license and a car through this season. Besides noticing his attractive best friend/business partner and ex-wife, Lightman gets a fling with Melissa George who guest stars for a few episodes in this season as a wealthy widow interested in the science behind the man who sees through lies.Working with Lightman is his best friend and source of occasional sexual tension, Dr. Gillian Foster played by Kelli Williams. She is sweet, optimistic, and mothering to everyone around her despite not having children of her own to dote upon and has a hand in helping Cal with Emily's problems. Brendan Hines plays Eli Loker, a radical truthist who dabbles in telling everyone the truth about whatever he is thinking whenever he is thinking it during the first season. Near the end of the first season, he was caught in his first lie and after a long journey back to trust he has eased off the maniacal behavior in the second season and spends most of it trying to get a date and pining after his co-worker Ria Torres played by Monica Raymund. Torres' used to work in airport security until she was recruited by the Lightman Group in the pilot episode due to her ability as a ""natural"". She had the talent and skill, but not the specific science to back it up so after some honing, she is an essential part of the team.In Season 2, the stakes are higher than ever before as the Lightman Group has to do everything from stopping a bomb blowing up nearby their building to finding a missing amateur poker player hours before the equivalent of WSOP Final Table begins to identifying what went wrong to cause a soldier's PTSD with a virtual reality video game to determining if a young hot widow (Melissa George) murdered her husband for his money. Emily's life is put in danger a few times to scare Lightman away from cases and Emily comes into the office to help a few times as with a schoolmate's sister revealing why she ran away and joined the porn industry.This series really fit into some of my movie watching nights inbetween ""House"" and ""Law and Order"" as every episode had a case and a mystery to solve through science/evidence. Dr. Lightman is no Dr. House, however. He tries to be off-the-wall and unexpected but misses some of that charisma needed to truly pull it off. The science was really fascinating in the first season and in the second season, they ease off showing how the Lightman Group is noticing things in order to speed up the show, but it loses a little of that fun where as a member of the audience, you want to try and learn something to use in your next poker game. It always seems like someday it would be ideal for Lightman and Foster to get together, but it seems like it will never happen because they are too good of friends for that. It is entertaining on a pretty average level now and I just can't get as excited for a new episode like I would for ""House"" or some of my favorite finished shows, ""24"", ""Law and Order"" (WHY did they cancel it?? The original is the BEST!), and ""LOST.""Bonus Features:There are extended and deleted scenes from several of the episodes and a gag reel where everyone makes silly faces and flub lines. After the series began, Dr. Ekman began to be concerned that people in real life would forget it was a fictional series based in science and try to use things learned on the show for actual court trials, etc. so he began a blog to explain how conclusions were reached in each show. Seeing as how Dr. Lightman has about forty minutes to find an answer that would take real-life Dr. Edman considerably longer, he felt it was necessary to connect the dots and ease his worries about the use of the science outside the show.The most interesting featurette is ""Dr. Ekman/Dr. Lightman - Lie Detection Tutorial"" that introduces the man fully to the audience and his staff and they even dissect some of the individual interview segments with Samuel Baum and cast members to determine if they are telling the truth, embarrassed, etc. It is pretty interesting and ""Eli Loker: An Honest Man"" talks about his radical honesty tangent and how that would end up playing out in the real world and what signs to look for to find out if a girl is into you."
"Lie To Me is a brilliant take on the investigation into the behavioral clues people constantly emit but would never admit. Everyone I know falls for this show hook, line and sinker. The best part is knowing that the science behind the show is actually real! Furthermore, Tim Roth is the perfect character for the lead. I would recommend the entire Lie To Me series to any and everyone!"
"I am so hooked on this series. I have told more people about it because it is interesting, educational, entertaining, well written, well acted and awesome."
Love this show!  Sorry it ended at season 3.  Great variety of story lines and funny characters.  Interesting to try and see if you can tell who is lying.
"Very interesting, good actors, good acting, good character development, and eccentric male lead with quirkyhead positions.  The unshaven look only works with a. few men and those that attempt to copy it look like bums, seedyThey should try for some kind of decent beard or be clean shaven."
"The main character here is  a lot like the character HOUSE, AND HE IS JUST AS GOOD AT HIS JOB. INTERESTING STORIES W ITH INTERESTING PEOPLE."
"I love watching Tim Roth, he is a great actor and he seems to become the part he's playing. I actually watched this when it was on tv and I rarely will watch anything more than once. this is worth a 2nd viewing."
"Well, there's one good thing to being laid up. I get to watch LIE TO ME. Yes, I find myself trying to determine the &#34;emotion&#34; the characters are displaying. See how well you can do it, I dare you."
Cal Lightman is my favorite character. I see myself in him a lot although he is much better at reading faces than I am. This show is o e of my favorites.
"What rich characters Roth is amazing!!! Too amazing to be real!!! and of course it is TV!! I enjoy the very divergent plots, and the different emotions the players go through as they slowly reveal their history. Keep it coming!!!!"
"One of the things I've spoken of from time to time is that with the invention of the DVD great television shows have been given a second chance. Where networks have a tendency to seek out the quick fix, the show that needs to be a hit in 3 weeks, DVD gives viewers a chance to sink their collective teeth into a show and really find out if they like it or not. And when they discover a gem on DVD, they begin watching that show. Such should be the case for LIE TO ME, the second season of which is now available on DVD.For those who haven't started watching, the show focuses on Dr. Cal Lightman (Tim Roth), the head of The Lightman Group. His company is in the business of researching how to know if someone is lying or not. Cal has come to the point where by simply looking at a person as they speak he can recognize the tell tale signs that they are indeed lying, a human lie detector if you will. The show simply involves him in stories that revolve around both clients seeking his help and his personal life where it comes in handy. Everything from being taken hostage by a man accused of killing his wife to wondering if his teenage daughter is visiting college frat parties is fair game.But Lightman is not alone. Along for the ride is long time friend and partner in the business Dr. Gillian Foster (Kelli Williams). Foster is the rational mind to Lightman's off kilter style of handling things. Where Lightman might seem completely off the wall most times, Foster is one who keeps things together and does most of the clean up work afterwards. Season one featured Lightman discovering that Foster's husband was cheating on her. Season two deals with her being newly divorced which in usual TV series would lead to her going to bed with Lightman. Not so here.There is a strong bond between these two characters that surpasses physical attraction. This is not the MOONLIGHTING/X-FILES type series where we are certain the lead characters will fall into bed with one another. These two are friends first and foremost as well as partners. They genuinely care for one another. They watch each other's backs. But season two sees trust issues come between the two of them that will eventually need to be confronted.Helping out in lead roles are Monica Raymund as Ria Torres, a Lightman prot&eacute;g&eacute; he discovered in season one working as an airport passenger inspector. Recognizing that she had a natural gift for spotting lies, something that is quite rare, he has hired her for the Lightman group and is honing her abilities. Season two finds her sharpening her skills and learning to realize she should trust those skills more often.Rounding out the Lightman Group cast is Brendan Hines as Eli Loker. Loker is a different sort of character. He does much of the research and is learning Lightman's techniques, but he doesn't have that natural ability. His character works hard but feels underappreciated and flirts with the idea of leaving throughout season two. But while Loker can't recognize it, viewers get the impression that Lightman has big plans for him. It's just that Lightman, the curmudgeonly out of synch with kindness type, never lets on just what those plans might be.Season two finds The Lightman Group with a problem that starts early on. With Cal's ex-wife considering a move to Chicago and taking their daughter Emily (well played by Hayley McFarland) with her, Cal decides to buy out her shares in the company so that she can use the funds to start her own law practice there in D.C. Of course this puts a financial burden on the company which changes the dynamics of the show. Rather than pick and choose the clients they want to learn from, the company now must take on simple tasks like discovering if a rich man's wife cheated on him or not since they're in a battle over a prenuptial agreement. It rankles Lightman to take on these cases but it pays the bills.The underlying personal affection between Lightman and Foster continues and while it never reaches the aforementioned stage of a series where they end up in bed, the attraction and the love between two non-married, non-dating people teases each and every episode, whether they're making eyes at one another or fighting over the business. To this day I'm still not sure where these two will end up and that makes for more interesting viewing.Season three of the show is currently airing and that's the beauty of these DVD series. A person can pick up the first and second seasons and discover what a well written, well acted show this is and then jump on board. It is one of the best shows on TV now and deserves a bigger audience (which is unlikely since it's up against the juggernaut DANCING WITH THE STARS). But perhaps that could change if more people watched the DVDs and found out how good it is. This is one DVD set that's worth adding to your collection."
"This series would be for those who like mystery, drama, great acting, good stories and comedy all in one.  It's easy on the eyes and mind.  Really enjoyable to watch."
"Le to Me season 2 is very good.  I find it to be kinda silly sometimes, but the base story line is good."
"Lie to Me continues to be one of the most unique and intriguing shows on TV. It's intriguing psychological twists not only keep you on your toes but also subtly develops the inner layers of the characters.The acting is fabulous, which I suppose it has to be since the show teaches us to spot the signs of lying, ie acting. Tim Roth continues to  steal the show but everyone in the supporting cast does an amazing job.The writers make each episode a mix of something totally fresh while building the underlying subplots and relationships. If a shows major plot isn't a subject that appeals to me I still get caught up in the psychological back stories and the continuing character development.It's nice to have a show that wraps a meaningful story around a wide variety of scenario's without relying on cursing or violence.Paul Ekman's science of reading facial expressions and emotions is intriguing. I'm sure it's glamorized here but just by watching the show you start to become more adept at seeing what the people around you aren't saying, that was unexpected but a pretty nifty benefit."
"We were bothin love with the show and deeply distressed when it was cancelled (why do they always cancel the good shows and leave those brainless &#34;fighting housewives&#34; and the like on the air??)Anyway, I own all three seasons and had given her Season One last year.  She was so happy with it she wanted to do a marathon right then...but had to wait until her guests left."
The writers have brought in new characters which keeps the series interesting while slowly revealing background on the main characters to give the viewer a better appreciation of why they behave as they do. Not every episode will wow you but many will and they do manage some interesting surprises and comedy along the way.
Can't say enough about this show. Tim Roth is the best actor I've seen for years. He portrays this character so well u think u know him. This is a must see show.
The stories are totally absorbing.  The application of the science offered by the Lightman Group seems endless so the stories are never duplicated and ALWAYS exciting.  Each episode leaves you wanting more.  The main characters are  very interesting and their stories continue to unfold in each episode making the series even more interesting.  Season 2  is great.  Check it out!
bloody fantastic! why isn't this on regular television? I'd be watching whenever it came on. if the powers that be did that- they'd have to keep the same cast. bloody enjoyable.
"This wonderful series just gets better and better. Tim Roth fits this characterization so well that he could BE the doctor he plays. Story lines change just enough to snare the viewer completely, yet keep the main plotline going throughout the series and keeping certain tensions and questions always there. I love this series and wish it would never end!Tim Roth is a master at his craft! Where has he been for we Americans? And the daughter! What an engaging girl! So perfect in her role--not at all the typical image of a rebellious, ill-mannered teenaged girl. She is someone you could love, and do love, along with her father. Everyone is just right in this series, and it is mesmerizing. Let's have more of it!"
"That mid-way through the season Gillian started wearing dark colors for a bit.  Then, all of a sudden, she was back.I guess asking me to rate this show is like asking dolphins if they like fish.  YES!  I am so sad this show is off the air, but then I wouldn't have the enjoyment of watching again and again.  I'd be too busy watching new shows of the series rather than the great ones already done (I have to admit, however, that I don't LOVE this show as much as Doctor Who).The episodes were wonderful and I'm already getting ready to watch season 3 (the last, sob)."
"I wish that I had been taking notes on all the &#34;tells&#34; when people are being deceptive...I may have to watch it all over again so that I can memorize the signs. I liked the season 1 stories a little better, but still holding my interest."
"There is not much to say accept the people who gave this show 3 and four stars must be from theplanet ""Mindess"". They don't know what interesting is. You know the type! It is very difficult for them to do something besides breathe. I can not go ino every plot or situatioin. But my hats off to the director , producer and certainly the actors who can't be equalled. This is not a show with a light plot.  It is show that twists around someone in the show and then goes on to something else. It is a show that keeps changing central charactors, which is the good guy and who is  the bad guy. Or, maybe there is not a good or bad guy.I will reccomend this TV serriew to people who ejoy thinking and getting envolved woth the charactorswhich is getting envolved with the plot. In short the stories are extremly complicated, but basically simple. Buy it."
"WOW - after the first 12 episodes:not what I expected (different from season one) but the best""crime"" TV show on the air now.... almost all episodes feellike a feature movie..... great stories - REAL GOOD stuff!(only in one early episode (2nd or 3rd) the Fox guys seemedto have forced some of their medieval stupidity on the writersand Cal acted totally implausible for a guy with his""talent"".....)MUST BUY!!!!!"
"I just live this series~ all three seasons. Wish there were more. The quirky style of professionalism and love Tim Ross creates for Cal Lightman is often tinged with eroticism. This combination adds zip to Dr Paul Ekman's masterful studies of microexpressions. I appreciated the education in this area, got his book, watched YouTube as well.Been useful in my work."
"What an awesome season!  Katy(Gemma) story line was so well acted.  Opie's grief for Donna and Jax's decision to keep it quite and fallout that occurs from keeping that secret, was a nice character development.  Highlighting Chib's is what I like about the show;  we are continuously learning about each one in a wonderfully written show.  Bring on Season three."
"This show is really addictive, I am now a huge fan, gets better every season, I watch this on my Kindle thru Amazon Prime, and I have watched 6 seasons within the last month!"
"Sons of Anarchy was not another 'bad biker' drama.  It had captivating sequences which held your interest to the end.  The violence and sex was marvelously filmed and was not over bearing.  The acting was excellent, except for an occasional mis-cast actor.  This is definetly for mature audences - not for childern.  Good story."
Really a good show...always something going on .... Keeps you on your toes...never know what's gonna happen next....awesome...can't wait till the next show....
"Never knew where they were going to take it. Always left me on the edge of my seat and definitely cannot wait to watch Season 3! Always seemed to go where I thought it would, but in a different way. Very exciting season."
"This show rocks in every way--the writing, the acting, the action.  This show predates &#34;Breaking Bad&#34;, but is just as good.  There's even a character who starts out &#34;good&#34;, but circumstances bring out her bad side...and that's great!!  Watch it!!"
I started watching this because Steven King recommended it and I like Steven King novels so he pulls a lot of weight in my book. Well I'm hooked! You won't fall asleep watching these shows. Fast and continuous action are what keep me glued to the set or tab.  My wife thinks I'm crazy. Don't get caught up with facts and details just sit back and enjoy.  Not for the weak of heart. It's adrenalin pumping action that will definitely raise the blood pressure.Lots of foul language and violence so be aware.
this is one of my favortie shows so i had to buy all the seasons..im so glad that i own these seasons now.i recommend this to anybody
The show has good dramatic writing--assuming you ignore the errors concerning modern forensics.  Too many times the MC's club-members spit in the face of an enemy they've killed for any of them to be riding free.
After watching season 1 I'm hooked on this show can't wait to watch more.  The show just pulls you in and you can't wait to see how they will get out of the next problem.
Great story line and acting. The story line uniquely illustrates strong family morals and ethics in the same manner as &#34;The Godfather&#34;.
"I was hesitant to start this series and some of the brutal beginnings made me pause to go on. As we got to know the people in the series we were able to connect better to the story line and by the beginning of Season 2, we were hooked. Definitely rough and even brutal at times, but the story still pulls you in and you really care. Great series."
This show was recommended to me by a friend and I found it to be well written with great actors.  It is the type of show that you start watching 1 episode and end up watching 3 or 4 more.
"Oh, man, SOA season 1 was off the meat rack.  Excuse me, I mean it was FLAWLESS!!!!  And the writers, directors and cast follow up with season 2 perfectly.  Someone wrote a review saying that they never thought they would like a show about outlaw bikers and I felt the same way.  However, the writing and performances are so GREAT that you just cannot deny that this show is addictive.  I am so looking forward to season 3 'til it's ridiculous.  I truly believe that The Linson's and Kurt Sutter will not disappoint for the 3rd. installment of SOA.  This is one FANTASTIC SHOW!!!!"
This is by far the best show on TV or ANYWHERE... Fabulous. I didn't think I was gonna like this but a friend talked me into watching it. she said &#34;just watch the first show... you'll be hooked&#34;  and I was ... very Hooked&#34;.
"My son is hooked on this series. What a great gift. Easy to shop and ship from my seat, not my feet. Thanks Amazon"
I loved this series.  I did not expect to which made it even better! I think addiction is my word.
Wonderful DVD series! Received the set before promised date and love the package set.  This is a great show and now have the entire series.
"Usually with a second season of any show, the writers seem to lose steam and the show fizzles. Not this show!! If anything it keeps getting better with every episode!!"
even better than the first season. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"Doesn't matter the season I love em, I grew up with Harley's and hung out at a bike shop so I can understand and relate to this, not all the violence but definitely saw some..."
Love season 2 very entertaining good story plot from season 1 right through season 2. If you like the channel FX tv shows then this one won't disappoint you.
"The second story of ""Sons of Anarchy"" is highlighted by excellent acting on all accounts. There are no weak characters and only strong performances. The characters are interwoven in intriguing situations. The stories are not for the faint at heart: there are portrayals of rape, violence, and death.There is much tension arising from the stories. The problems increase and grab the viewer. One often does not know how situations can be resolved. A looming problem from season one is resolved over time, yet with much drama that nearly tears apart most of the characters. There are new white supremacist protagonists who are unsettling. A positive result is this makes the motorcycle criminals more appealing by comparison. These new villains create new conflicts from multiple angles which keeps the second season very interested. The friendships and defense of families among the criminal main characters allows viewers to root for them. One would probably want to familiarize oneself by viewing the first season before jumping into the second season."
I literally stayed up and glued to the tv all day and night finishing up the whole season in one sitting!  Twists you never saw coming.
"It takes considerable effort to improve a series that started off so well, but Sons of Anarchy does get even better this season.  The plot and characters seems like they have more to them and the cliff hanger makes you want to jump right into the next season."
This show is amazing....Kurt Sutter has done it again... Fast paced and entertaining and a hit of humor...love the Gemma and Jax storyline...
"This is definitely when the series hits it's stride (okay I've not watched beyond here so I'm assuming). After the promise of the first season this really amps it up. By giving us a &#34;big bad&#34; (using the Whedon parlance), we're more engaged with the characters, while the clubs internal strife is equally monumental creating an important balance within the show. All the acting is great with the exception of a few extras or one liners but I'm assuming there's more going on behind the scenes then we even know. Definitely check this series out if you haven't already, you won't be disappointed."
"If you're a fan of the series SONS OF ANARCHY then you're probably aware of most of what happened in this season and want to pick it up on DVD to watch it again and again. If you're not a fan then you probably haven't seen it yet. I fell into that category and now find myself recording the third season which just began. This is a solid series that may take the low road, but remains interesting if nothing else.The Sons of Anarchy are a motorcycle club (what most would consider bikers), officially known as SAMCRO (Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original). This group is the original band, the beginning of the club, though most have passed away. Originally started with 9 members, the club has expanded and as we've learned in season two is even international. Comparisons to the Hells Angels would be expected, but knowing their reputation for dealing in drugs and more the link isn't really there.The Sons deal mostly in illegal weapons and small time extortion, tending to protect the small town of Charming, CA that they live in rather than do it harm. They keep out drug dealers and meth heads, keeping the streets safe even if they do use a bit of violence to do so. The story never turns lose of the fact that these are dangerous men who do dangerous and illegal things and yet you find yourself rooting for them. Perhaps it's the biker mystique that has long been associated with freedom and a life without care. But those two things aren't found with the Sons as they have as many problems as anyone.As I said, I never saw season one, but from what I gathered, club president Clay Morrow (Ron Perlman) made the decision to take out a member named Opie and by mistake that member's wife was killed. At the same time, vice president Jackson ""Jax"" Teller (Charlie Hunnam) was trying to decide what to do about the club having read his deceased father's ""manifesto"" wherein he discussed the fall of the club should things continue down the path they were at the time of his death. Jax knows of Clay's orders but doesn't let the club know. He'd rather attempt to save the club than see it destroyed from within. Add to that the fact that Jax' mother Gemma (Katey Sagal) is now married to Clay and the plot thickens.But that's just how the new season opens. Not only does Jax have to contend with attempting to reshape the club in a new mold, he has to continue helping with the old. While attempts by the ATF to shut down the Son have failed, setting up a new source isn't easy. Ties to the IRA are slow moving and personal grudges between members of both groups won't make for nice bedfellows.Worse yet is the arrival of someone new to town, a businessman with ties to a white supremacists group known as the League Of American Nationalists (LOAN). Ethan Zobelle (Adam Arkin) is sly and cunning, something the Sons haven't faced before. Hiding any connection to this group from the locals, Zobelle has plans in motion that will change the face of Charming forever. With his hooks already dug into the town's mayor, Zobelle will use this force to shut down the Sons and take over the town, allowing all the things the Sons prevent from running rampant and taking his cut as well.Along with this storyline we find the Sons becoming involved with a legitimate business due to the wife of one of their imprisoned members coming to them for help. That business is the porn industry and while it may be unsavory for most, it's a legit moneymaker that the Sons need while trying to restart their arms business. It's a business that Jax brings the Sons in to and that Clay wants nothing to do with.The crux of the show pits Clay and Jax against one another for various reasons. At the core is the knowledge that Jax has of Clay's actions as well as the resentment he has for the man his mother married. But both men deep inside want nothing more than for the Sons to continue on. They just have different ways of seeing how that will happen.Toss in the IRA double dealing, an ATF agent with a personal grudge, a chief of police who helps the Sons as often as possible and a deputy chief trying to keep things straight and you have a decent drama going on here. Best of all it doesn't rely on weekly fist fights of motorcycle chases to hold a viewers attention. It actually offers a story and some great acting to go with it. Perhaps the biggest surprise to some will be Katey Sagal's portrayal of Gemma, a woman who sees herself as the mother figure for the club, trying to keep it together as well as keep the two men who mean the most to her from killing one another. Forget Peggy Bundy, this role offers Sagal something that she can display her acting chops with. And when a twist in the story involving her comes out (sorry, for once no spoiler on that one), you'll feel so involved in her tale that you can't help but feel for her.As I said, the series revolves around a group of men who choose what most of us would avoid for both a lifestyle and for a profession. But as for offering great drama it delivers in spades. The show will hold your interest from beginning to end. I for one found myself watching it and thinking, perhaps I'll put in the next disc and see what happens. The next thing I knew it was 5AM and I'd spent the entire night watching the second season and setting the DVR for season three. It is that good.A word of warning for parents: the show is seen on FX and like many of their other series is definitely not for kids. Slight nudity and extreme violence are the norm for this group and visible throughout the series. Just a warning for those uninformed."
This season wasn't as good as the first one but its worth watching if your going to wacth the series.
"If you can take the gritty in your face drama dealing with guns, drugs, gangs, their dealing with law enforcement.  This show has everything, mc chases/action for the guys, drama for the women.  Character depth and depiction in this show are spot on amazing for law enforcement and the the mc clubs/criminal elements of show.  The actors really pull in the muscle and deliver their characters authentically.  The way the mc club deals with other gangs, similar to politics.  Setting is also realistic depicting the urban decay of our Nor-Cal roadways, and urban buildings.  I just wanna know where all the award nominations are for this show.  Motorcycle Clubs are about the men, but the women in this show really pull their weight, especially Katey Sagal.  I am not into bikes other than the creativity that goes into the custom bikes,  and never thought I would be interested in this show, but it is truly awesome for a TV show.Season 2 is awesome with a gut-wrenching ending.  Your gonna feel it, and won't be disappointed."
I bought the series for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. Kurt Sutter is a genius and a this series is fantastic.
"I think that this was agood season of SOA. I like Jax character. I thought the character, Gemma played by the great Katey Segal did an amazing job in this season with everything that her character went through. The last episode was very suspenseful with the baby being taken."
Good show ... good characters ... great acting.Same review as the others -- better language could be used ... and less severe dramatics.I like the show -- I am watching all Seasons.
good show..wish there was more gag reels and deleted scenes..i'm more about those things than the actual show...but that is not for the seller that is for kurt sutter to do.
I would have never watched this show if my son had not teased me!  So not my kind of show - it took me about all of season one to get &#34;involved&#34; with the show to want to keep watching - now I can't stop watching!  GREAT SHOW!
"This show is addicting. It is so well written, that it keeps you on they edge, trying to guess what will happen next."
this was a very potent soa and man the third season is off the chain as well.  Can't wait to get the other seasons as when you watch them in this style versus TV it's more understanding.
"I did not think this series could be as great as the first season, but whoaaaaa nelly ! It just keeps getting better. Kurt Sutter knows how to pile on the suspense & action. The actors are perfect for this show."
"Keeps drawing you into their circle. Mamas watch out, papas get the shotguns out. Can't wait to see Season 3."
"Every season of this show has proven to be great, I cannot wait for the final 2 seasons to air.I have watched them all 2 more times on Amazon and I own them all on Blu-Ray to boot.As always Amazon streaming works great."
"This is one of the best seasons in my opinion because it contains the road trip episode.  There is a scene in which Mac takes Charlie to buy his first pear and Charlie eats the entire thing, sticker and all.  One of my favorite scenes of the entire show."
Best show ever. If you like watching total degenerates do as they please in some of the best and moast hilarious situations you will love this show.
Nothing sacred has been spared on this series but the characters and writers have made their handling of each topic very funny! Over and over I can play each episode -and I do- and not get bored. It is a very good series.
"This season is one of my favorites.  The series is really hitting its stride and, as with the other BD releases, the bonus features are hilarious."
"12 Episodes on 3 Discs, being released September 14, 2010""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" debuted in 2005 and now its fifth season is coming to DVD. The series was created by Glenn Howerton, Rob McElhenney, and Charlie Day (who recently appeared in ""Going the Distance"") and the three hold writing and producing credits for it. They also star in it as Dennis, Mac, and Charlie along with Dee played by Kaitlin Olson and Dennis and Dee's father, Frank played by Danny DeVito. The premise is that the group owns and works at a bar called Paddy's Pub and this is a group of the dumbest, most ignorantly entertaining people you will ever watch. They don't seem to understand most social interaction rules and each of them thinks quite a bit of themselves and they are always fighting and out to get each other, therefore hilarity ensues.Episodes from this season include the gang going to the Grand Canyon, exploiting the mortgage crisis, Dee and Charlie getting fired, giving Frank an intervention, the Waitress getting married, the gang trying to go to the World Series, Mac and Dennis break up, the D.E.N.N.I.S. system for attracting and making women dependent upon him, the gang attempting to write a movie and be in a movie by M. Night Shyamalan, the gang reigniting a rivalry for Flipadelphia (a beer flip cup tournament), and my favorite episode - Kitten Mittens where Charlie invents a new product. Another episode that I really enjoyed was where the gang decided to put on a wrestling event for the troops and Mac, Dennis, and Charlie became a team called the ""Birds of Prey"" dressed up with feathers all over, but Frank steals the show as ""The Trash Man"" whose gimmick is eating garbage. Eww.This show is so wrong that no one should ever watch it, but we all do because it's  guilty pleasure seeing just how far these characters and the actors who play them will go.Bonus Features:There are about eight hilarious minutes of gag reel which just make me marvel that they are EVER able to film the show with the type of dialogue they riff out. There is a four minute original featurette that's a dating profile of D, the Waitress, Mac, and D's renaissance woman actress friend. It's pretty silly as D gets really drunk, the Waitress's gums bleed, etc. The Schwep dream sequence is a five minute video made up of almost 24,000 still images put together to show some behind the scenes action on the set and even reveal Fred Savage and a crew member wearing a ""What Would Kevin Arnold Do?"" T-shirt. It is all put to music with no dialogue.There is also a bunch of deleted and extended scenes from various episodes like the intervention episode and the commentary on select episodes is pretty funny about how scenes were filmed and how much Danny DeVito loves wearing Crocs. The best extra is probably ""Kitten Mittens"" on an endless loop (about five minutes)! It shows all these adorable kittens wearing the mittens going about their daily activities playing, eating, etc.This set is a must for anyone who enjoys this show with great extras and the episodes all have fantastic re-watch value. I'd even say they are funnier the second or third time you see them."
I love &#34;It's Always Sunny!!!&#34; Who wouldn't? I love Frank. I wish I were a part of this cast. The stories the come up with get zanier and zanier everytime and I LOVE IT!
"This for me was the best season so far of this absorbing series and it reached a brilliant and shattering climax with the murder of JFK. Of course, every viewer knew this was coming. The question was, how would the writers handle it. The answer is that they managed to absorb this pivotal event in U.S. history with extraordinary subtlety and sensitivity, absorbing it into the fabric of the drama in a totally seamless way.The central character of Mad Men is Donald Draper, played brilliantly by Jon Hamm. Season by season, we gain a deeper appreciation of the complexity of this brilliant character and the emptiness of his inner life which he is constantly trying to fill. We learn more about the childhood traumas that have made Draper the man he is -- and how nothing -- neither his job nor his beautiful wife, nor his kids, nor his constant philandering -- can compensate for the spiritual void at the center of his soul. Draper is a superb creation on a par with Tony Soprano.Others in the cast are also wonderful. Draper's wife Betty, an ice queen, has her own needs which Draper seems incapable of meeting. Her kids, especially the oldest girl Sally, are also coming into focus as characters in their own right. And the large cast of characters at the ad agency provides tremendous range and variety.In short, this series is beginning to build a serious artistic legacy. Can't wait for season four."
"The two lasting images in this episode are Betty with her new-old Victorian fainting couch with dress to match and Don in a late night reenactment of the noir film NIAGARA, seedy motel and all. Everyone else is good too but maybe it is because everyone back in that time period wanted to BE Betty or Don, that they captivate us so. Everyone continues to jockey for position at Sterling Cooper.  Seemingly the order of the day is to just outflank your colleagues at Sterling Cooper.  Cooper himself outflanks Draper so that Draper can't leave him high and dry while Peggy tries to do just that--moving out and on, probably with Duck who has all female product clients with another agency. Joan is gone but I really don't believe it. As for Roger Sterling........... uhm..... Roger who?"
"An extremely creative and well-fleshed out portrayal of advertising executives, their co-workers and their families in the 1960's.  Gives the same or better dramatic quality and acting as ""The Sopranos"" and ""Deadwood"".  You may find some minor things to quibble about, but the overall product is pleasurable and enjoyable beyond expectations.  In fact it surpasses Season 2 given the minimal use of surreal fantasy and flashback which can be irrelevant and distracting to viewers."
"Season 3 continues the story so masterfully told in the first two seasons of this superb series, as Don Draper and the rest of the crew at the ad agency tackle new challenges, both professionally and personally.  A brilliant, well-crafted series, this latest season sees new character development, compelling story arcs and wonderfully well-written and acted episodes that are engaging, humorous, believable and witty.I'm a big fan of 60's tv shows (Wild Wild West, IDOJ, ST:TOS, The Saint, Avengers), and movies (Sinatra/Helm/007), and this brings back that golden era in a contemporary, well-designed series that's believable and engaging.  I like the story arc w/Hilton, and Don's response to increasing pressure as his success at work builds.Great job, to all involved - thanks for another winning season!  Looking forward to many more.-Ken Calhoun"
"After a  fantastic season one and a still great but less  good season two, Mad  Men really delivers here during Season Three. While everybody writes it it must be repeated, the writing acting and direction is superb. While Season Two was at times m ore dark and sinister, Season Two despite being somewhat less weird has not lost its touch. We get to follow the partners of a very successful Madison Avenue advertising agency during the eraly 60's and we see the impact of the Kennedy assasination on these career-oriented people. While it is constructed in a very slow-moving way, one is surprised when the season agains ends on cliff hanger episode."
"Mad Men season 3 takes place in 1963 when Kennedy was assassinated in December of that year.  The characters mirror the chaos and unease of the disaster and suffer personal and professional changes.  Don begins the season with a pregnant wife, contented personal life and successful career in the ad company which was taken over by a British company last season.  What happens with the Company, marriage and Don's hidden past life is amazing as everything meets unexpected crossroads."
"I ordered series one and two after reading the positive reviews on Amazon about this show.  Added to that the ton of awards it has also won I was very interested to see if the programme would live up to all the positive hype.  One and two were amazing and Series three is fantastic.  I have enjoyed them all and have encouraged friends and family to watch the show because it is just that good.  Do yourself a favour and watch all three series, you will not regret it."
"Season 3 of ""Mad Men"" is the best season so far, and I think Season 4 will be even better! There are so many twists and turns in the storylines this season, and I don't want to give anything away by saying two much here. I will say that I did not see the last two episodes coming at all, and the season finale is the best episode of the show to date. I'd even go so far as to say it's one of the best episodes in all of television. ""Mad Men"" is so mart, so slick, so stylish...it's one of the best TV shows ever. If you're still not watching, you need to start."
"So well done!  I lose myself in each episode.  The casting, the acting..all of it is superb!  Everyone involved in this series is to be congratulated!  What GREAT work all of you did!  Thank you for fantastic entertainment!"
"What can I say about the entire series that hasn't already been said? Pure delight, great attention to detail, extremely high quality for a TV series. Casting, writing, directing, screenplay, acting..I shiver with delight every show."
"Special Features and Specs For Season 3 Have Been Announced:Mad Men is truly an excellently produced show on all levels, as should be evident from it's adament fans, critical praise and many awards. The first season established the world and introduced the characters, the second season expanded and elaborated on each and the third season finally presents a complete vision. The third season doesn't have quite the same punch of the first season, nor does it have the exploration of the second. What it does have is a nice combination of many elements. After all the anticipation and two seasons of building up this season things began to happen, it was also a season with more comedic elements tossed into the mix after the seriousness of season two. If you watch this show you'll want to buy this set to catch nuances you've missed in the first viewing and if you haven't seen this show catch it on AMC or buy the first season because now is the time to immerse yourself in the well crafted world of Mad Men.This season contains the following 13 episodes:Out of TownLove Among the RuinsMy Old Kentucky HomeThe ArrangementsThe FogGuy Walks Into an Advertising AgencySeven Twenty ThreeSouvenirWee Small HoursThe Color BlueThe Gypsy and the HoboThe Grown UpsShut the Door, Have a SeatThis four disc DVD set will be released on March 23rd, I'm glad they're not making us wait until July like last year when they wanted the second season DVD release to coincide with the third season television premiere. The episodes will be presented in Anamorphic Widescreen video. English 5.1 Dolby Digital and English 2.0 Dolby Digital Audio options as well as English and Spanish subtitles. Closed Captioning will also be included. The set will also include the following special features:Mad Men Commmentaries: As with previous seasons cast and crew will provide audio commentaries on the episodes, in the past commentaries have been included on each season episode with some episodes having more than one commentary option.Medgar Evers: The Patriarch. The Activist. The Hero - A documentary that explores the life of the Civil Rights  Pioneer who believed in a better way of life for all through equality and the end of segregation.Up In Smoke: A visual depiction of the juxtaposition between the world of advertising and big tabaco in the 40's, 50's, 60's and today.We Shall Overcome: The March on Washington - Dr. Martin Luther King's speech accompanied by images detailing the historic moment when over 250 000 people who marched on Washington.Mad Men Illustrated - Dyna Moe gives commentary leading you through the ""animated"" photo gallery of Mad Men illustrations.Flashback 1963: An interactive look back at the events and themes that defined that year.All in all you're getting a lot of special features by the time you add up all the, always in the past, insightful commentaries with the amount of featurettes on the sixties. These features are great for those interested in the era of Mad Men and I've always been one who enjoys a good commentary but I must say I'm still upset at the lack of behind the scenes special features. No actual interviews with the cast, crew or writer's of this fine series. No 'on set' or 'behind the scenes' looks, no journey into the writing room to see how they designed this crucial season. I'm not saying the special features they are providing aren't great though, just that personally I'd love to learn more about how the show itself is made and that hopefully they will announce more features before this season is released.Five Stars for the quality of these episodes after having seen them on television and for the quality I'm sure we can expect the DVD episodes to be in based on how great past seasons have looked on DVD. Also five stars for the amount of bonus features they continue to include, which are always interesting despite not being as much about the show production as I'd personally like (I still hope that will change). Ultimately Mad Men is a great show that most people can find something to enjoy about and this season is crucial as it's the one where things have started falling apart. It's like the season three ending song Shadaroba says, ""the future will be better than the past"", and while things may get worse for the characters of Mad Men, certainly before they get any better, we can bet that the future of this show will only get better. Fans know this show is amazing and those who haven't tried it yet should before the fourth season really shakes things up. Thanks for your time."
"The plot line of the third season that was the most interesting for me was Don's relationship with hotel magnate Conrad Hilton.  Don meets Hilton at the Derby Day party, but at first knows nothing more about him than that's he's a guy looking for a drink.  Hey, Don can certainly identify with that, and hops behind the vacant bar and whips up an Old Fashioned or whatever for him in no time.  Over the drinks Don and his new acquaintance recognize one another as country boys who had to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps.  ""Call me Conny,"" says Hilton, in way of an introduction, and expresses a desire to have Don do some advertizing work for his hotel chain--as Conny would like nothing better than to work with a fellow self-made country boy.In the ensuing episodes Don does his best to develop an advertizing campaign for Hilton.  His resulting pitches are essentially the iconic magazine spreads that I saw in the 1960's, with Hilton hotels as the perennial source of American amenities for international U.S. business travelers.  ""How do you say hamburger in Japanese?"" asks the glossy magazine add.  The answer is, of course, ""Hilton.""  Despite this brilliant pitch, however, Conny remains nonplussed.  ""I said I wanted the moon,"" exclaims an irritable Hilton.  ""The moon""--what the hell is that?  I guess it's whatever a rich kook like Hilton wants it to be!  The lesson to Don from this foray into smoozing potential clients is to leave this sort of thing to Pete and Roger."
"Bets finally finds out a few things about her husband, Don continues to cheat on her while she does the same, the kids suffer in the process, the British owners of Sterling Cooper shake things up at the firm, Sal can't hide his gay identity forever, Peggy really comes into her own, Joan must deal with her husband's failings, JFK's presidency comes to an end, the Civil Rights movement is well underway, and the acting and production design are still as strong as ever in this, the third season of Mad Men.Bets is still unlikeable: cold, mean, unappreciative of her kids and always making them go outside or upstairs or to the tv room to avoid interacting with them, and yet you can't help feeling some sympathy for her.  Don is gone most of the time, doing as he pleases, though he forbids his wife to do the same.  The Draper kids get more screen time as well.Things have changed so much for the agency and for the Drapers by the time we reach the finale that it really makes a fan wonder where it will all go from here.  Good suspense."
I sooo wish this show hadn't been cancelled and had caught on like Dora did. I cannot stand Dora and my toddler loves Kai-lan. She loves the music and animation so much more. Kai-lan is adorable. Our toddler has some crazy mood swings and when we sing Kai-lan's songs about dealing with feelings they REALLY help.
My five year old son loves this show.  It teaches social skills and Chinese all at the same time. Nice clean program for any age!
This show is very cute. My 8 month ok loves it. And I love that its on prime. The 2 year old like it as well.
"Geared for young children, when you watch carefully, the show actually teaches social stories as well as Chinese words.The character friends stumble upon some type of social-emotional problem, such as feeling left out, being impatient or unwilling to share, upset about a mistake, or playing too rough. Kai-lan encourages viewers to review a problem, identify the feeling, and find a solution. Sometimes help requires asking a grown-up for solutions. When one character has a problem, the ripple effects and consequences are shown. Kai-lan sings &#34;It's up to me and you,&#34; and shows how children can take responsibility and ownership of problems, as well as solutions. The cute songs and vocabulary review make learning easy."
"My 5 and 2 year old LOVE Kai-lan!  She is very sweet and her friends and deal with real life little kid issues like learning to share, how to not have a bad attitude, how to deal with anger, and be kind to your friends.  Great real lessons, and very cute too!"
The show is great.  But my granddaughter ordered this automatically without my permission.  I have since learned how to block ordering.  All she had to do was press watch this now - and I payed  She just pressed buttons and watched these shows all day long.  The shows kept her occupied and she wanted more and more.
"I am a huge Top Chef fan- I have watched and own every season of Top Chef, and Season 6 is definitely my favorite. The contestants are the most talented, the food and the challenges are the most interesting (it's the first season they started doing &#34;High Stakes Quickfires&#34;, and I almost don't hate who ended up winning!If you watch any season of Top Chef it should be this one!"
"""Meat Natalie"" is one of the better episodes of the latest season of Top Chef. The Quickfire Challenge is fun and campy- make TV dinners inspired by TV shows,ranging from The Flintstones to LOST. (""Top Chef Masters"" also has a challenge in making a LOST-themed meal) The twist is at Tom Colicchio's Steak restaurant in Las Vegas. The contestants are prepared to grill the meat on the BBQ... but they have a special guest, Natalie Portman (Queen Padme Amidala inStar Wars Prequel Trilogy) And she puts the competitors to the test--make a vegan/vegetarian dinner for her and her friends.The contestants are truly baffled, and lack background in meatless cooking. They don't have people like Roxanne Klein, Deborah Madison, and Tal Ronnen to help out! The contestants come up with some stunning dishes. They're more stylish and sophisticated than the meatless dishes in these great cookbooks:Linda McCartney on Tour: Over 200 Meat-Free Dishes from Around the WorldThe World in your Kitchen: Vegetarian recipes from Africa, Asia and Latin America for Western kitchensSunset Vegetarian Cooking - Nutritious Recipes With Flavor & Imagination""Meat Natalie"" is a fun,educational episode!"
"I enjoy many reality shows but once I discovered Top Chef with season 5 it became my total favorite.  This year at the Emmys Top Chef won the Emmy for Best Reality Series.  A huge honor definitely long overdue.  This season - season 6 in Las Vegas - has been on preorder with Amazon for what seems like an eternity.  I don't really understand why.  I did purchase season 5 New York from them but Top Chef has a special deal with Target and many seasons available on dvd are only available at Target.  I purchased this amazing 6th season of Top Chef at Target months age.  Those of you endlessly waiting for it on Amazon know that you can get it at your local Target.This season is definitely a must have for it is the season that earned the show its Emmy.  Padma Lakshmi is the perfect hostess as always and head judge Tom Colicchio and judges Gail Simmons of Food and Wine and Toby Young are back with 17 new contestants.  Each episode is amazing.  There is a quickfire challenge which leads to the elimination challenge and all are creative and display the chefs at their cuilinary best or struggling at their problematic worst.  Las Vegas works very well with this show and what I love is you don't need to be a professional chef or know all culinary terms to be interested in this show.  I love food and am fully enthralled in the personalities involved but moreso with the skills these chefs possess and can't wait to see what dishes they will come up with.  This season we have two brothers as contestants which adds a definite twist.  Also the ante really is upped with the creativity of the elimination challenges.  The mix of personalities and skills of the chefs is also very well done.  Judging is done honestly and fairly and judge's table is a definite show highlight.I adore Padma, Tom and Gail and by now they seem like family.  I watched this season when it aired on tv and am now watching it for the 3rd time on dvd.  Many episodes have added footage and to watch it with no commercial breaks adds to the intensity of the ongoing contest as the chefs are voted off one by one.  This show will entertain and educate.  It is not a reality show that is just a mindless waste of time.  It instead uses reality tv to educate all on cooking, competion and we meet the highest caliber chefs as judges and special guests.  I think almost anyone would be highly entertained by this very high quality show."
"I love Top Chef and this and the all stars season are my favorite seasons of the lot.  Very apparent that the level of talent was quite high this season, I just wish I could actually eat the food."
I just love the competition . The rotating judges are a good idea also. I have been fortunate enough to have been exposed to the preparation of food through friends and associates. Great Show
Had a few problems with watching it but customer service did a great job working it out. Loved it.
Fun show that highlights the faults of what happens when companies get too big! I like how they use irony in the episodes.
"I actually found myself laughing out load as I watched this all by myself. There are some incredibly funny performances here. If you like The Office, Parks and Recreation and those types of shows, you will love Better Off Ted."
GREAT show. Even funnier cause we all know corporations think like that. Too bad this show was so short lived.
"Better Off Ted' is an excellent example of programs that don't develop a fan base until its too late. The writing and acting are excellent. Portia de Rossi is spot-on as the corporate suit with no empathy or moral compass, Jonathan Slavin and Malcolm Barrett are hilarious as the lab geeks with zero social skills, and Jay Harrington is perfect as the buffer between them. If you haven't seen it yet, take the time to watch both seasons. You'll be glad you did."
"While not quite as strong as season one, I still really enjoyed this sitcom.  Smart, fast-paced, and with a great cast, it is still better than 99% of what is on TV now."
Few shows are as engaging and the characters are superb!  Portia is fantastic and the rest of the cast incredible.
It's a shame that it is no longer on air. It was one of the few comedies that actually made you laugh. The characters and the actors who portray them are wonderful. Everything clicks.
"The Burning Plain starring Charlize Theron and Kim Basinger is a very interesting drama from start to finish. Theron really shines in this film, she shows remarkable emotional depth as Sylvia, a woman who suffers from depression and a secret she has carried since she was a teenager. This film is non-linear which I love, three different stories that somehow connect through time and distance. The Burning Plain is an amazing film, I highly recommend it! Enjoy."
"I have not been disappointed with the movie selection, and video quality on Prime instant yet. This movie had great acting by two very talented actresses. Moving story line across two generations, and how the choices we make, and actions we take affect ourselves, and the people around us for a lifetime. Great dramatic performances. Enjoyed it very much."
"Telling a non-linear story isn't easy but this writer-director pulls it off with aplomb. The movie's story structure plays like a piece of music.There's the A melody about a successful woman who's personal life is a mess. Then the B melody about troubled teenagers. The C melody explores the relationship between two crop duster pilots and the daughter of one of them. The D melody reveals an illicit affair.The movie weaves these melodies into a regular rhythm for the first two acts: A B C D, A B C D, A B C D...Don't be fooled: the repetition of this rhythm isn't predictable when you watch the movie. In fact, the excellent writing and the mesmerizing performances of the actors will pull you from scene to scene. For a movie with no action scenes, you will be surprised at how often you are on the edge of your seat, waiting for the next revelation.And thus we learn how each of the melodies is connected to the other and how events from one melody influence the previous one.A unity emerges, binding events from future to past and past to future.Disparate geographies are connected: from the gloomy, blue-tinged, rain-sodden Pacific Northwest to the warm yellow and brown primal landscapes of west Texas, and the golden hues of Mexico.The third act breaks the rhythm as events collide and rebound and merge. Once the music of the story ends and the music of the ending credits roll, you'll find yourself pondering and maybe even hoping for an encore."
"I've read several of the reviews and some are too long.  This is a beautifully done adult movie with adult themes that isn't all about sex and graphics.  It crosses racial, i.e., socioeconomic, lines.  You keep asking ""Why is this? What is going on?""  You ask yourself ""How could someone get to be this way?""...then, you find out.  A part of you roots for the humanity of each of the characters.  You can sit back and just enjoy the story and the bit of a shock ending which becomes immediately logical.  The movie gives you some ""movie satisfaction"" when it is over."
"BURNING PLAIN is far more than a successful movie, it is an art work on celluloid that holds the viewer's attention and plays with the mind and emotions in a way that few other films have succeeded. Guillermo Arriaga has written another intelligent, cleverly paced walk through a maze that ultimately leads to finding all of the handsomely carved pieces of a puzzle that fit together so well it defies improvement. Known for other brilliant scripts ('Amores Perros', '21 Grams', 'Babel') this script he elects to direct with a cast of actors providing extraordinary performances. If this film doesn't win in every category of the Oscars this year.....The film has been given the tagline 'Love heals. Love absolves. Love burns.' The story, told in fragments of times past and times present, explores the lives of four women whose relationships are part of the secret the film reveals: Kim Bassinger is Gina, a married woman with children, including a perceptive and damaged daughter Mariana (Jennifer Lawrence), who has survived the mutilation of breast cancer and finds desperately needed love in the arms of Nick (Joaquim de Almeida), a clandestine love affair that takes place in a deserted trailer house in the outskirts of Las Cruces, NM. Charlize Theron (Sylvia) is the manager of a classy restaurant in Oregon who soothes past bruises with numerous superficial liaisons, one being with her chef (John Corbett). Maria (Tessa la) is a young girl living in Mexico with her father Santiago (Danny Pino) and his co-worker and friend Carlos (Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Yazpik). Each of these four women - Gina, Sylvia, Mariana, and Maria - is complexly tied to the others. The match that ignites the story is a fire that ends the lives of Gina and Nick, and after this tragedy the children of the two lovers - Mariana and young Santiago (J.D. Pardo) - bond and provide further fodder for the development of the ending of the story. To say more would destroy the tense, beautifully hewn script's conclusion. All is not as it seems until Arriaga pastes the pieces of the conundrum together.The cast is first rate, with Bassinger and Theron offering some of their finest work to date. The cinematography (Robert Elswit, John Toll), the music score (Omar Rodriguez-Lopez), the careful editing (Craig Wood) and the casting (Debra Zane) all are first class. Once again Guillermo has proved his gifts as an artist - both as a writer and now as a director. One of the finest films of the year. Grady Harp, September 09"
"This movie is wonderful! Charlize Theron Jennifer Lawrence, and Kim Basinger are all amazing! Their acting performances are flawless and they portray their characters brilliantly! The story line is very good and hits you close to the heart in so many areas and it's interesting to see all the pieces of it fit together throughout the film! I think everyone should see this movie!"
Books and movies that are not predictable are my favorite. This movie took me awhile to catch on to the premise so I gave it a good rating. The beginning drags only because it is out of sequence to the story. It takes time to get used to the back and forth of the story line and then it hits you what is going on. At that point everything makes sense. I'm trying not to give anything away so details about the story won't be given here. I would suggest this movie to anyone who enjoys something different.
This movie has the&#34; feel&#34; of being authentic from the opening scenes; all three actresses come across as totally real persons.
"Inarritu, creator of ""Amores Perros"", ""21 Grams"", and ""Babel"" writes and directs perhaps his best script, actors, and cinematography yet.  He resists excusing or condemning any of his characters.  This narrative device here resembles a certain Aldous Huxley novel as even the smallest details turn out to be crucial."
"The story behind the movie was showing teens that parents are human and not always perfect.  While teaching Parents that a child becomes daring as a teen lots of times what they have seen their parents do as they grew up.  The Actors in this movie looked like one another, as children and as adults.  Very good casting on the part of the Executive Producer and star of the movie Charlize Theron, as well as the mother Kim Basinger of the teenage Sylvia played by a young new and upcoming star Jennifer Lawrence who plays Sylvia or Vivi as a teenager, she will be a great star if she continues to act like she did in this movie. The part for Charlize Theron's character Sylvia as a grown up was great with the way she handled the emotion and turmoil of her life as a teen and the men in her life she handled them as they meant nothing to her, as an adult.  The entire cast should of got awards for this movie and their acting was believable making it a hit in my opinion.....Link to the movie:http://www.amazon.com/Burning-Plain/dp/B002N4QCTE/ref=pd_ys_ir__6"
"I agree, if you like movies that are action packed or have  high speed car chases, then this movie is not for you.  But if you love a good drama, then this is it.  As far as plot, I had a tough time following it once or twice, but the movie really intrigues me.  I'm guessing I'll understand it better when I watch it again, which I will do, probably a lot!  Among other things, it clearly shows what can happen if your past defines you or is something so intense that it never lets you go.  Awesome cast, amazing performances by them all."
"This ended up being a few hours well spent, and I hope more people get the chance to share this film with someone. This was not released locally, or anywhere really with that 20 screens over a month thing, but it did make the release posters and the buzz has been great.The story follows the lives of two families over twelve years, edited non-lineally so we see the consequences of their actions early that then shapes what becomes of their shared tragedy. Outstanding performances by everyone (nice break-out showing by Jennifer Lawrence), a beautiful score, elegant filming, powerful landscapes and some great editing all make for a worthwhile time investment. The Blu quality is reference material from beginning to end, from the ocean scenes to the burning desert trailer set made popular in all of the ads and artwork. Line definition gets tested immediately with that opening bedroom scene: Theron against the outdoor lighting - nothing left to the imagination anymore. The DTS was mixed eloquently, especially the airplane dusting scenes and even the brief explosion sequence. Even if I were to rate this film less than five, the main supplement is a near-perfect documentary about film making itself and it would still give this the highest rating.* Making of, 43:27 minutes. A lodef director-narrated piece that covers every facet of what it took to make this film. He did this in a unique way through job descriptions and casting choices instead of the drier logistics. He describes and shows some of the jobs you never hear about and the trust he had in this group. Highly recommend giving this a try as it is even edited in such a way that it keeps interest.* Music, 15:33 minutes. Was the only thing they left out of the main documentary, they cover it adequately here - a solid score but it does cater to the music fans only.* HDNet promo, 4:46 minutes. The standard ad plug that once you watch the movie, you realize how little this actually represents the quality of the story.* BDLive, nothing there.The sound is a 5.1 DTS, with English and Spanish subs. No region coding shown. Wonderful product that I feel is worth the time. Enjoy."
Just collecting movies with Jennifer Lawrence in it.  It is a good movie and was early in her career so it is only brief with her in it.
Anything Timothy Hutton appears in is certain to be interesting and worth seeing more than once.  He's one of the finest actors in film and on TV and has deserved far more Oscars and Emmys than he has received.  I'm waiting for the next DVD I can order that features his work.
These kids are energetic and talented. My 3 year old granddaughter dances around the house listening and watching them. She loves the Fresh Beat!
Happy to have gotten something that my niece likes.  She sings the songs and is always asking to have the disc played on repeat.  I'd recommend this for 2 to 4 year olds.
"Though the TV show is a bit hokey for adults, it is more than suitable for the little ones and the original Fresh Beat Band songs are fantastic.  This quad (which consists of 2 young ladies and 2 young men:  Kiki, Morena, Twist and Shout - lol) have great singing voices, dance, play their own instruments and are always using their social and cognitive skills to help each other solve whatever problems arise during a particular episode.  While watching Nick Jr., I caught my youngest (at the time 16-17 months) dancing to their songs, smiling, laughing and pointing to the TV whenever they came on.  My daughter is now 20 months, still loves the show and is singing the songs!The Fresh Beat Band display very fun, energetic performances and while it seems their target audience might be between the age ranges of 5 - 10, younger children (and some adults ... like myself!) will enjoy the grown up sound of their music (cross between pop and hip-hop) and the positive messages they promote.This is a real band (not unlike similar/rival Disney ones) that actually tour the country!"
"Kids love this show!! Music is catchy but less annoying than other kid music, in my opinion!  We've also seen the group twice in concert. My four and two yr old love this show!!! :)"
"We love Fresh Beat Band sooooo much that we actually bought tickets for our 3 year old to see them in concert in February! She loves them and aside from some silliness on the part of the character &#34;Twist&#34; it is positive, fun, enthusiastic and more than that...nice to listen to from the other room."
"My daughter loves this. One day she was dancing alone. When I asked her why are you dancing, she said we don't put on weight :). She learnt from FBB."
"My son loves this show! It's fun, upbeat and entertaining. I think it's great for small children who love music and dance. Plus, it teaches a great way for them to learn all about rhythm and rhyme."
"I love this show for my daughter, because she watches it and learns about music, plus she's always moving/singing/dancing while watching it. It has really cultivated a love of music in her."
My son is autistic so he really really likes bright colors and music so it works really well for him.
My four year old loves this show. When my son was younger he also loved it. Unlike a lot of the Disney stuff that I won't let my kids watch alone anymore until I'm sure they are not pushing sex on my four year old daughter. The fresh beat band is fun where my kids just get to dance along and sing and I don't have to worry about the message.
"we love all things British and The Last Enemy is no exception.  Lots of intrigue, smart plot lines.  We were just so disappointed it only lasted 5 volumes!!"
"Great, Cumberbatch is a very enjoyable actor to watch. The story is well done and holds your attention throughout. It is good to see this actor in a role prior to his work in Sherlock."
Another great mini series with another batch of excellent acting. Don't know if there are any more or that's it. I have been looking for things to watch and have to say Masterpiece theatre has not let me down yet!
Another great BBC production. This one has the former Mr. Holmes as a mild mannered mathematician who continually does what no one else can do.Great series looking forward to more form BBC/
I watched this series on TV before but have gone back to it on my Kindle to focus on the deatils. The acting is superb and no on e is who you think they are. Superb plot lines and characters.
The premise of the show was very good and really makes you think about the lack of privacy in this post 9-11 world. It is a show that really makes you think about mandatory identification cards and how a good idea can turn bad with the wrong people in charge. Highly recommend the entire series.
Excellent!  With lots of suspenseful and unpredictable twists. The acting was great. Especially Robert Carlyle playing the ultimate bad guy whose motives come as quite a surprise.
I found this to be a very intense mini-series where everybody must have an ID card to exist.  I was looking forward to the next segment each time and was disappointed that it ended.
PBS called this SciFi - seems more like fact in many instances.  I enjoy Mr. Cumberbatch as an actor and respect the ensemble cast.
"A great series, this is one I have recommended to several of my close friends, and they agreed it was just great TV.  Mystery, Drama, and irony. I was wary about watching this at first, but after seeing 'Sherlock' with Mr. Cumberbatch, I thought I would give it a go, and I was impressed."
Cumberbatch is excellent.  The story line is great about the new surveillance environment we are living in and what is to come.  Watch if you are interested in how subtle we loose the rights we have come to be consider in alienable.
"This was a very exciting series, even if I could not understand some of the accents at times. Most were very clear, but not all. Story was great and I hope there will be volume two to see what happens about the brother Michael and his wife. Really scary idea about being controlled by computers and chips in our body. We should pray this would never happen to anyone."
I love Ben Cumberbatch. He is amazing in everything!!! I love this series. It's an interesting plot about how government tracts us without our knowledge and how much worst this is going to get in the near future.  I am going to watch this again and again. The acting is superb.
"The future is now.  I know this was released in '08, but it couldn't be more spot on with everything in the news today.  The same use of words we hear everyday.  Our protection.  For our own good.  It will make life safer and better for the (here is the expression I hate the most) &#34;Greater Good&#34; - whose good?  Not mine that is for sure.  This is how liberty is destroyed.The story line is fiction the premise is not.  The government has the ability to do all of this now; sans the vaccine.  Then again how can you be sure?  Answer:  you can't be sure.  Nano technology is already here - at least the part we know about.  In today's medicine you can swallow a capsule equipped with a camera...ahem or a &#34;Tag.&#34;  We already have this for our pets in case they are lost any vet can scan them to see who the owner is.  And...it is the size of a grain of rice.No, I didn't find the story at all far fetched.  I did find it very creepy because now we are becoming the pet with all of our personal and private information available tot he highest bidder - the guy with the scanner.I found this a very intense story.  The acting was superb and the moral is yours to decide."
"Had the blinders not been taken off our eyes by revelations about NSA snooping, this would have just been a clever piece of SciFi. Not anymore.  WARNING: This is  NOT a feel good movie but excellent story line that imagines what life would be like in a monitored society.  Evil has a pretty face and wonderfully logical mind in this film. I enjoyed the opening comments by the PBS host for the series as much as I did the show itself.The mini-series asks the question: How much is your privacy worth?  Be careful of the answer you give; The Last Enemy plays out one horrific possibility.  BTW fascinating to see how far technology has come from cutting edge in 2008 (when the series was produced) to present; everyone is using Palm Treo's!"
I really enjoyed Mr Cumberbatch as Sherlock and figured he would be good in this role.  Kept me interested and intrigued and I can not wait until I can continue with the series.  I do not know why the Brits just seem to be masters at this sort of television.
"From the moment this precient narrative begins, viewers are transported to another world, in the not too distant future. The whole ensemble cast, from Benedict Cumberbatch, to Anamaria Marinca and Robert Carlyle, make this dark futuristic tale by Peter Berry more believable. Cumberbatch is superb as Stephen Ezard, a research scientist just returning to London from China to attend his brother Michael's funeral. After all his years away, he is bewildered by an England he does not recognize; London has become a police-state. Unlike his late-brother, Stephen Ezard is a recluse who abhors germs and personal contact. Despite his walls, he's drawn to his brother's complex widow, Yasim (Anamaria Marinca delivers a finely nuanced tough/gentle performance), a medical doctor. They become embroiled in a swirl of conspiracies while he works on the government's super-database. Ezard's struggle to survive is a superb character study enriched by a marvelous performance by Cumberbatch. Robert Caryle is perfect as a menacing rogue government agent - quite convincing. Despite the subject matter, this isn't a political left/right film or story. As one outsider-character states, people have the right to be anonymous. ""The Last Enemy"" explores what happens when populations lose that privacy. A topical, haunting story, quite relevant to issues today, and also reminiscent of Ray Bradbury's masterpieceFahrenheit 451: A Novel."
I love British TV anyway but this series blows everything out of the water! I think everyone should be playing attention to what this show is showing and even through the host makes a point of stating this is just a TV shows these things are already in place and growing! I am not sure it is still on because there was only one season available on Amazon.I love everything I ever watch with Benedict Cumberbatch in he is such a great actor and so believable in every part he plays whether it is in this show or Sherlock Holmes. He is the best Sherlock! He stole each scene he was in! Love this actor he is brilliant ! The Brits really produce and write excellent shows! Bring more seasons to Amazon!
"I liked it has a nice balance of intrigue, action and suspense. I would like to see more but it stopped on episode five.It is easy to imagine how all that control would make it easy to control crime, medical treatment and so forth, but it is also scary to give all tha information meaning power to someone or a government."
"This series is intense, believable and gets into your head.  It's really given me insight into how much of our lives could be and are monitored by &#34;the authorities&#34;.  Benjamin Cumberbach rules."
"Great acting and great plot, Amazon you do us a great service and I for one really appreciate it. Keep up the good work!"
"Very well played by an excellent cast. The message of the production, however, is probably prophetic and thus frightening. We are already very close to that nightmare scenario, as witnessed by recent events. Whether by government or mega-corporation, we are already being manipulated."
"Don't care much for predictive cliff-hangers, but loved this one. Hard to tell the white hats from the dark, but liked the acting, characters, and ending. Too bad there isn't a sequel."
"Have transitioned from Sherlock Holmes novels to following Benedict Cumberbatch  which led me to this film. So engaging you hang on to every word and nonverbal cue. Well written plot and character development for the most critical viewer, and Cumberbatch and fellow actors are superb. Now, to the story line...you will think twice about Facebook, Snowden and the NSA...ignorance is not bliss."
Cumberbatch is better than ever in this tense drama.Everyone's acting is terrific; writing is top notch.Grabs you right away.
"Just love Bendict Cumberbatch, I didn't know who he was until I started watching Sherlock Holmes.  Now I'm sherlocked on him I have to see everything he makes.  This movie didn't disappoint.  All great actors.  He is scrupulously fabulous."
I think the british do a great job on movies. For some reason the put it all together and make a better show than we do.I liked it very much.
Hidden gem of show where the cast interaction is on level of excellence bar none.  A thespian experience that is intense and surprising moment by moment as the story goes on!
"cant wait to finish the seris, defintely tiding meover until sherlock comes out in november... want to see benedict in star trek too"
"This is an Orwellian distopia type drama set in the near future.  For those that like this type of storyline, it's quite good.  The acting from Benedict Cumberbatch is top drawer as usual.  You must pay attention, as there are a number of sub-plots going on constantly.  My wife and I are only on episode two, but already hooked."
This is a very good mystery.  I believe you will enjoy this movie and is good for the whole family.  Very good acting in this movie.
"the show was a well acted and gave me much to consider in every day life. A second season is needed,as I felt it left me hanging wanting to see the ext episode!"
I liked this tale.  It is very thought provoking.  It helps the viewer understand the price of having so much personal information on the Internet.  I have only watched three episodes but have enjoyed them immensely.
"This is a tense, suspense-packed series that I highly recommend.  It is Cumberbatch doing the offbeat guy he does so well---and a likable one at that!"
"Very sexy, intelligently done upgrade of Sherlock and Watson! Love, love, love it! Just wishe there were more episodes per season."
I chose this rating because I couldn't put my Kindle down. It had a slow start but then it started to move at a faster pace. By the time it was over I was crying with the main character. There were twists and turns I didn't see coming which increased my enjoyment because I couldn't predict accurately what was going to happen. I don't know if this story is for everyone but I did enjoy it.
"Surprisingly excellent series (surprising because I'd never heard of it before). If you liked Enemy of the State (Gene Hackman/Will Smith movie), this goes further and does an outstanding job of looking at the madness of total surveillance. The story is complex, the cast is extraordinary. What more do you want?"
This is a thriller from start to finish.  I watched Benedict Cumberbrand I think that's his name in Sherloch Holmes for PBS.  When I saw he was in this I wanted to watch immediately.  It kept me guessing right to the end.
"I loved this show. It's action packed and has a great story. I wish it was a series, not just one show. I'd love to see more."
"I enjoyed the plot twist and the ending.  It was thoughtful...very 1984.  In some cases, I don't think we are too far from the scenario.  Would like to see Volume 2."
Found this show when I was having Sherlock withdrawls. I really liked it but it obviously was cancelled since it was filmed in 2008 and says Season One. So take it for what it is and enjoy.
Am a big fan of &#34;what if&#34; movies and The Last Enemy is illustrative of this category. Thought provoking with relevance to our modern plight: how much of who we are will forfeit to our government for the sake of security? What guarantee do we have that the State will respect our privacy? How much have we already given away? Excellent movie!
I've always like Benedict Cumberbatch. I first watched him in Masterpiece Theater's Sherlock which he does masterfully. I haven't watched all of this series but the first episodes were very exciting.
"Dramatic, fast moving, and a bit scary as it gave a view into life with the government able to track your every move."
"I realled liked this series and was sad to see it end.  Very interesting for sure, thrilling at times. Good work."
"The subject matter of this well executed series is relevant to what is on the minds and hearts of people all over the world.  &#34;People have a right to be anonymous,&#34;  is a quote from the underground leader that rang true to my heart in this age with surveillance cameras everywhere and governments listening in on innocent peoples private conversations and email correspondence.Excellent!Peace,Susan"
"I enjoyed it very much - mystery, suspense, romance and a sad prophetic ending.  It would have been better if there had been some hope at the end for me however."
"Orwell had it all too right - this show dramatizes the risks of sacrificing freedom and privacy for a so-called 'safety'.Cameras and listening devices in every conceivable location, controlled and closely monitored travel, and social control by a government elite that answers to none......  Hmmm sounds frighteningly familiar."
Fund movie to watch with the family. A little too much action for my 16 year old daughter but just right for my husband and our 13 year old son...
awesome show in hands i would probably give any of the x-men movies a  five star review in action and adventure
This is a really good movie. it has heart and soul. this is probably one of the best and funniest eddie murphy movies i've seen in a while. and the little girl who plays his daughter in the movie is going to be an upcoming actress. she is so cute and really smart. i loved the story. and all the actors were great. this is a movie the whole family can enjoy. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
"Finally, a family friendly comedy that is both funny and original. Eddie Murphy, an ambitious financial investor, comes to believe his daughter's blanket can give him sound financial advice! Meanwhile, his competitor, Thomas Haden, uses Native American mysticism and animal aphorisms to woo clients. Add to this the adorable Yara Shahidi, who plays Murphy's daughter, andImagine Thatmakes for the first truly enjoyable comedy I've seen in years. The ending got a bit cliche, but at least it was done with style (Eddie Murphy's final wardrobe is quite fashionable!). In fact, I'd go so far to say that this movie has quite a bit of imagination."
Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This movie rocked because of it's awesome fights scens and I am pretty certain no other movie has stunts like this with elephants! Props
"If you like action this is a great movie for that. Awesome fight scenes and worth watching! Move over Jackie, Tony Jaa just took your place!"
"Jaaman returns in what I consider to be his best yet.  I actually like the story and I thought it was well acted and directed.  This is one beautiful looking film and just as brutal.  Jaa is in top form here as he goes through numerous fighting styles including the use of weapons.  The fight that ends the film is incredible and clocks in at almost ten minutes.  Yes, the ending left you hanging but this is part of a trilogy.  Think of it like the ending to Kill Bill 1 and you'll know what I mean.  It's so good they can call it whatever they want, this is now my favorite Jaa film."
"The third season of Californication continues along the same Holden Caufiled-esque journey of Hank Moody, he is still drifting, perpetually drunk and rudderless through one insane situation into the next... This season he falls backward into a job as a college professor after accidentally destroying the hard won sobriety of his predecessor, a far more successful and famous author. His casual attitudes about sex, drugs and relationships are starkly illuminated by disapproving stares of his teenage daughter.  This season features Hank in a romantic triangle with an older woman, a much younger woman and his T.A., all while he continues to try to finally win the heart and mind of his true love Karen. His sad-clown sidekick Charlie Runkle is back and as hilarious as ever, he provides great comic relief for Hanks depravity. Binge watch this!"
"Lots of twists and turns, irreverent and truly &#34;California&#34; style.  David Duchovny shines and stays true to character....a guy you may never want to know!!"
"I find myself cracking up even more than usual.  ""Dean Coontz"" is fantastic as the up-tight dean of the uni Hank is now working at (""Bueler.. Bueler.. anyone?  Bueler..), and with Hank's wife off in New York for a spell, the college setting provides a pretty good set-up.  Runkle's female agent boss is hilarious (""You say harassment, I say a couple of big juicy orgasms between friends""), as is the continuing saga of Runkle's marriage. Rick Springfield is one of his clients (turns out Runkle's girl may be better than Jessie's).The end of this season will be sure to leave you wanting more from the 'rocket man' and company.  This is an addictive show and Season 3 goes out with a bang.  Brilliantly filmed last scene."
But very sad ending.  I really enjoy the black comedy of this series and here in season three as a teacher...oh come on.  The series is funny and sexy and well written and this season might just be the best. All the players are in top form.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
"This season is great, not quite seasons 1 and 2, but still pretty darn good. However, by the end of the season you find yourself asking why Hank would screw up again and again. Well that is addressed in season 4 so you will just have to wait and see. It is a typical season full of laughs, frustrating, and at times emotionally painful moments. Still a great watch for those looking for interesting, creative television."
Possibly a glimpse into the life style of the Beautiful people of Southern California and probably isn't confined to Them alone.
The third season was filled with eventful twist and turns. This show is addicting. I want to see more and more. I recommend go back and watch all the seasons. I have seen every single show. I highly recommend this show.
"This series is for those of us that love life and the predicaments that can happen and you get caught at all of the times that you wish, as an observer, would love to either rescue, hide and save the characters from what happens when you are in the wrong place at the wrong time.All of the actors are endearing and acting out their characters at an A+ level.  I have all of the Californication Series and, of course, &#34;the Hankster&#34; stays in situations that make you love him more at every turn.I happen to love David Duchovny and have since I saw the movie &#34;Return to Me.&#34;A gorgeous man, intelligent and entertains at every opportunity that comes his way.Californication is a real mind blower and the observer is caught up in all of the raunchy, sexy and loving moments that have been made and rewarded by their peers."
"It's been working wonderfully, raunchly for two seasons; why mess with it?It's recommended I write between 75 and 300 words. So...So the theme is extended nicely, maybe into more-believable CA lore. I lived for20 years in the Hollywood Hills, LA; CAFORN's rendition so isn't far off. It's nowunobtrusively ABIT more serious and mature. No preaching. No harsh knockingof doing naughty stuff, just a few more implications there are consequences andbeing bad does come with some painful (or inconvenient) lessons from whichone should learn.But the girls are still beauiful, the sex is as close to X as possible, Hank as horny as ever,maybe moreso. A few 'immorality/substance abuse are bad' lessons are slipped in, viatouches of angst, trouble, embarrassment and ennui; not enough to curdle the cuddle-the-voyeaur formula. Okay, I'm between 75 and 300 words.I hope they keep doing versions of what they're doing. It's like visiting the old homesteadyou grew up on. For a lucky few. You go Hank, or David. America needs more sticky-gooey irresponsible, edge-nudging vicarious sports to turn off the recession.."
"...for loving, liking, or hating Californication.  If you've made it to Season 3, you've seen somewhat of an evolution in Hank Moody (emphasis on ""somewhat"") and the show itself, from a highly entertaining, ALWAYS well-written but relatively shallow dissection of the California entertainment lifestyle (kind of a 40-something, high-six-figure Entourage) of Season 1 to a maturing, in his own reflective way, of Hank in Season 3.  You came for the gratuitous ribaldry, now stay for the reality of Hank's life-choices setting in.Surely, many dislike Moody's antics and devil-may-care attitude about pretty much everything he interacts with, but the grounding principle of Californication is the sheen of LA tarnishes quickly when real love and family are at stake.  This is what I love about the show - it lures you in with its flash and fast-living, but reminds you frequently that the lifestyle Hank lives isn't what ultimately makes him, or probably anyone, happy.He's the ultimate lithario, just good looking enough to inspire attraction and a high-functioning wordsmith that almost always seals the deal for him.  As a guy watching the show, I would imagine most of us wish we could come up with, let alone manage to pull off, the verbage Hank Moody does seemingly every minute of every day.  Still, its a hedonistic existence that doesnt bring him joy except in the short term - but if Hank grew-up, what would the show really be?To me, this is a writer's show about a writer, and while there is plenty of sex and occasional action and drama, its the flawless, yet believably effortless dialogue that keeps me coming back season after season.  I thought Season 3 began well and ended on a much higher level than any prior year, with Hank's sins finally catching up with him in a big, big way.  Would we all, on some level, like to behave like Hank Moody?  Season 3 reminds us that we're better off watching him from a safe distance in 1/2 hour episodes.  Watching on DVD, six hours flies by, and like any good train wreck, its fast, spectacular, impossible to look away, and ultimately heart-breaking."
"Yeah, this series is filled with T&A and excellent writing.  The multitude of plot surprises is worth every cent you pay.  You will not be bored with CALIFORNICATION."
not out for that long do not know why?  i never watched this TV show when it came no rips dents or other disasters to the case.
I love the Stargate Universe series. The actors are so perfect for their parts and it is a joy to watch this science fiction action. I higly recommend it to all scifi fans.
"With ""Battlestar Galactica"" all wrapped-up, I was hurting for more hard core sci-fi! ""Caprica"" filled that gap until the season ended. Then to my surprise a new Stargate adopted the hardcore egde! I know that some people will hate this but I cant get enough. SGU starts out a bit slow and I think that's great.Early on the newly formed crew is desperately trying to find out where they are and what the hell happened! They learn that they're on a ship called Destiny very far away from earth. They must also find basic recources for survival but most of these people aren't trained SG military officers. Naturally lines are drawn and alliances are made. And like BSG and Caprica, no mercy is shown. There are military men and women with guns and more guns and there are civillians. They have no guns. Guess what happens when critcal life and death descisions need to be made and one side has guns and the other does not? Yeah - It gets ugly.As time goes on the crew finds a new star and planet that wasn't originally there back in the day. Some of the crew decide to stick around because they think who ever created the system will help them get back to earth! Really? Mabey these super-intelligent beings dont want filthy humans pissing on their brand new planet. Time will tell!...I love this kind of Ultra hardcore sci-fi. Im glad to see that the Stargate franchise went in this direction and I cant wait for season 2. Wether you like sci-fi or not this show is a great buy. It's the kind of show that's actually genre bending! Is it really sci-fi or is it drama? I had to ask myself that question about BSG. What do you think?UPDATE:The special features are top notch! It's all in HD and well put together. You get to see the actors behind the scenes as well as insight on the sets. There are also sit-down interviews with the actors, opposite the producer and creater, to discuss the psycology of their own character(s)! But for me seeing the actors outside of their charaters was eye opening. The most drastic difference was with Louis Ferreira. You quickly begin to understand just how good these people really are.UPDATE 2:It's been CANCELLED."
"At first I was not as happy with this Stargate as the others, but it still kept me interested enough to keep watching it.  It is a much darker version of Stargate, but I also think a much truer.  I loved the characters and it made me very sad that they did not continue the show."
"This is a series that was cancelled before its time.Two great years of episodes.The series had a great cast of actors, stories, special effects, and music.It is different from the other SG series which I enjoyed too; however, SG:U is my favorite one of the SG series.Watch and enjoy!"
"Many people have compared this offshoot of the Stargate franchise as a Battlestar Galactica wannabe. Since I've never seen the newest BSG series, I can't compare it myself. So, I'll just say that I loved this newest SG installment and wish that it hadn't been cancelled after Season 2. However, even though it was cancelled, it was just so much fun. Now, the stars are off doing other series. However, if I ever win the Lotto, I will personally fund a TV movie or another season of this show. I miss the characters and would like to see them again."
"I was very disappointed that Stargate Universe got canceled, a real poor choice on scifi channel's part. I at least can re-watch it here on Prime video and dream about a movie that will never be and the demise of good science fiction on television."
"I really like how this story line deviates from the other SG shows.  The other shows condensed a story line into a few minutes of light drama, action, comedy, and always &#34;saved the day&#34; no matter how far gone things were.SGU does not do this!  While there is a plot in each show, there is still the large plot that is &#34;where are we going, and why?&#34;.  The story line is more adult/grown up, and is a more of a mature &#34;soap opera&#34;.To bad the series ended short, due to the reasons I stated.  It lost the key group that kept the other SG series going."
"It's too bad they didn't take this series further, because it was actually really well done.  It takes a much darker approach than the rest of the Stargate series, which I really liked.  It didn't try to be funny, but instead focused on the classic questions and sense of wonder that make sci-fi great.For those who liked the cheesy jokes and two-dimensional characters of the other Stargate series, this probably isn't for you, which is most likely why it was so short-lived.  For those who tolerated the other series but prefer something with a little more depth and intelligence, then this is the Stargate series for you.I enjoyed the complexity of the characters, who could be both villains and heroes and still maintain the lead roles.  I also enjoyed the constant suspense, sense of exploration, and the quest for ultimate understanding that drove the plot.  I guess when it comes to intelligent sci-fi on TV, getting cancelled is just destiny."
Great series. It was great getting to see how people are at their best and worse it any given circumstance
"Season 1 was brilliant.  I liked it when it originally aired, but forgot how great it was.  Sad that it only lasted 2 seasons, I was expecting a movie later."
I love sci-fi. This almost makes me wish that I had a chance to be on the Destiny. Imagine if we could experience something like this. Great imagination. I wish it was still on. Everyone who is behind the show did absolutely fabulous job and thanks to Amazon for bringing us the series.
"I never had the chance to watch this show while it was airing and now love it. To bad they cancelled it, it really has a great cast and story line. I will be lost to find another series as good when I finish watching season two."
This is a different kind of scifi.  I'm still in season 1 and it will be interesting to see where it goes.
Certainly among the top 5 sci-fi pieces I've ever seen. Ranks with 'Fringe' for instance. Keep um coming. This is a movie buff's dream.
This show is quite different from Stargate because it has a story line from one show to the other and can be followed accordingly.  The plot has a lot of suspense and mystery to it but is quite intertaining.  Would recommend this show.
I just love the series. It's very interesting and gripping to see these detectives work cases. Great show to watch.
"I love this show I hope more seasons come so I can enjoy watching it, you feel you are right there with them."
An overview of many of the Presidents of the USA with information on their political lives and glimpses into their private lives.  Entertaining and educational.
Loved the series we have watched so far.  Very informative - much information that was unknown to us.  Would recommend this to all ages as a great history lesson.
We really enjoyed &#34;American Experience:  The Presidents&#34;!  It was so informative about each president.  It gave you an insight of their private and public lives.  We highly recommend seeing this well-made production.
Excellent!!! Loved it! it covered the president whole life without dragging it out!! Great film clippage. Can't wait to watch all of them!
"We have not watched any yet but the one (in 4 parts) on Ronald Reagan.  It was very well done - honest, fair, and (it would seem) thoroughly documented.  Ken Burns is to be praised for his attention to detail, and writes of those parts of Reagan's life that are admirable and of those that were less so (no perfect Presidents, of course, but some are more to admired than others).We enjoyed it, and were fascinated with all the detail added."
"This series is one of the best of its' kind.  We have  seen several similar videos, however this series is located in ONE place. High quality videos, great content-its' all good."
"American Experience delivers insight into the politics, personalities, and historical perspectives of six presidents. Covered are FDR, Truman, LBJ, Nixon, Carter, and Reagan. Just to be clear, I did not buy this. I watched it on Amazon Instant Video. I especially enjoyed FOR as it covers the Depression, World War II, and the effects of polio. Beautifully narrated by Historian David McCullough I recommend watching all or part of this 17 episode presentation."
"Like most schoolkids, I learned history via the &#34;factoid&#34; approach.  I have really enjoyed these documentaries for the chance to put together in my mind the broader issues going on in society at the time.  They are still, of course, a mere glimpse into the lives of these powerful people, but I have learned so much."
"This collection of 17 DVDS (grouped in 3 DVD cases in a slipcase) is an updated version of the 2008 PBS Home Video set, which only went through President George H.W. Bush to include the addition of the program on President Bill Clinton. (To my knowledge there were no American Experience documentaries on the later President Bush - W - and President Obama is just ending his first term.).The earliest subject is Theodore Roosevelt ( a program originally aired in 1998 along with 5 of the others) and now covers 11 consecutive Presidents (with one exception - Eisenhower! - will they ever get around to him?) Though packaged together until the ""umbrella title"" of  ""American Experience"" these show were produced and directed by different people but all appear to be well balanced and objective. I've seen a few of these stories on either TV broadcast or on individual volumes over the years. There is almost 39 hours (!) of material in this set, so I'm still working my way through.But, based on what I've seen so far I can highly recommend this collection (with a significant reduction in ""per President"" cost) to any history or political junkie and it certainly is essential for any media library.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic"""
Excellent behind the scenes look at the lives and deeds of our presidents. Listen in to their taped conversations with most trusted confidantes. Great historical benefit. Here's a revelation...our presidents are NOT saints with the best interests of American's at heart!
So far I have just watched the episodes on FDR but I must offer the highest praise for the wonderful details and enjoyable story telling. The actual video is so remarkable. I have learned so much about FDR. I am sure the remaining episodes are equally good. I recommend this show to everyone and it would be great if all high school students could watch and learn from  this as a part of their history lessons.
"If you want to learn about biblical times, from Abraham to the new yeast ament, then this 3 part documentary is recommended. It's by PBS"
"The Empires series &#34;Kingdom of David&#34; did a great job at &#34;connecting the dots&#34; by filling in the information explaining how the Jewish people got from the biblical account of their nation to what we see as the practice of Judaism today. People who study the Bible must wonder how the Jews came from the temple service to the present practice of the Synagogue. The series treated this part of Jewish history very well. Rather than taking an &#34;events & dates&#34; approach, the producers blended the historical account with the religious and philosophical development of the Jewish people. I found this a great help in better understanding this fascinating culture."
"This series is deceptively droll.  It takes a few episodes to realize exactly what this series is doing.  When you do put it together, it really is laugh out loud funny.  The creators have taken the most bucolic English settings of a dream life country life style and plopped down on top of that the grisliest murders.  These are all committed by these archetypes of English gentility. To solve these murders are added two seemingly staid and bland detectives who traverse all this scenic countryside in business suits.  As you get to know these two, however, they are quite eccentric themselves.  The older detective, a chief detective, resists moving to the countryside, although his wife wants to do so, because it is so bloody and grisly.  He finds cities far more restful! The younger detective travels the country lanes in their car as if he were Mario Andretti on acid. The older detective's daughter treads the boards of community theater in plays so awful that it would be more interesting to watch paint dry.  This becomes more and more compulsively watchable as you catch hold of the spirit of the whole thing.  I recommend you give this a try.  Netflix streaming as of this date shows seasons 1-12."
"I've seen every episode at least twice.  The main characters are fun; the scenery is beautiful; the number of murders in this relatively rural area is remarkable and part of the underlying humor.  It is a fun BBC/English detective series with not much violence, no profanity, no nudity.  The entire series is great although I stopped watching when John Nettles retired so I don't know about the series after that.  I highly recommend it."
"I really like this show.  I am a fan of Inspector Lewis so when I watched them all the way through series 5,  I began to look for something similar.  This show fits the bill.  The only thing I find curious about both shows is that, (just like in US cop shows), there's never just one murder.  There's the first one, and then another and another.  Anyway, it makes for good TV."
"I've watched seasons 1 & 2 so far and have been very entertained as well as mentally engaged. The plots are good, and while I could guess whodunit on a few, on most I couldn't be sure until the last 15 minutes. Each episode is luxuriously long, and the acting quite good. I enjoy the bits of humor weaved in, and appreciate not seeing a lot of violence. Just really good storytelling. Thank you Amazon for having these episodes on Prime!"
"This is an improved rerelease of the Midsomer Murder episodes. Now with SDH subtitles. For those who do not own them, they can be purchased in sets that come in the correct order of the UK airings. If you own previous DVDs, be sure to check that you are not duplicating. If you are new, sit back and begin to enjoy one of the best cop/crime shows ever produced in the WORLD, and it continues today (2013), 16 years running. And expect multiple murders.TOP British crime drama, with a twist of humor and romance. And then there is the awesome footage of British village life, as spectacular as any English documentary/travel DVD. The characters are believable, and the crime solving is reasonable, although complex enough for the most avid of mystery fans. I have never watched an episode that was not a 5-star production. Speaking of stars, every British TV & film star now wants to be a guest star on this show. Guest stars began in the beginning, and are a part of what makes this such a delightful series. Prepare yourself for some very tender moments or a belly laugh. It has it all.Tom Barnaby (John Nettle) became an icon for Murder Mystery TV fun. Episodes are based on novels of Caroline Graham. Eventually most reviews of other crime shows get around to comparing to Midsomer. It's that good.SUBTITLES NOW INCLUDED, an update from the old releases. Midsomer episodes are 100 minutes each.1-The Killings at Badgers Drift  -March 19972-Written in Blood  -March 19983-Death of a Hollow Man  -March 19984-Faithful unto Death  -April 19985-Death in Disguise  -May 1998"
"Midsomer Murders was rather refreshing after watching police procedurals such as Wire In The Blood: Completely Wired - Series 1-6 Collection [NON-U.S.A. FORMAT: PAL Region 2 U.K. Import] and Touching Evil: Complete Collection. The two latter shows are great crime dramas, but much more gritty and gruesome than Midsomer Murders.Amazon Prime members are able to view Midsomer Murders' episodes via instant download for free and I must say the stories are engaging and interesting. Set in the bucolic English villages in Midsomer County, the murders that occur here(at an alarmingly high rate, one might add) are in stark contrast to the serene beauty of the English countryside.DCI Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) resides with his wife Joyce (Jane Wymark) in the country town of Causton, where the Criminal Investigation Department is located. Tom is a meticulous investigator and an astute observer of human nature. His methodical investigative methods and keen eye contrast with his young DS Gavin Troy (Daniel Casey) who is not very PC and often blunders to the wrong conclusion regarding the identity of a particular murderer.There is a Gothic feel to many of the crimes, which is enhanced by the unique music chosen to accompany a particular episode. At times, certain scenes seem overly exaggerated, but to me, they only add to the charm of the show. This is a great example of atmospheric crime dramas with a wonderful ensemble cast and riveting storylines. Midsomer Murders will appeal to fans of British cozy mysteries, where blood and gore take a backseat to wit and humor, and the focus is on investigations set amidst a bucolic, close-knit setting."
"Just when the world could not seem to get any stranger, it goes a deeper level- cryptically bizarre.The episodes follow the precise same structure as the previous season, but it goes farther in the revelations- in a greater number of the tapes, you actually see the creatures the tapes deal with, not only that, but a greater number of people meet their doom (don't worry, some live on), and, in the end of the episodes, you do get to learn a lesson well worth learning- if the government says an ""official"" story and there's evidence that contradicts them- it's worth being skeptical.There were a lot more moments in this season than the last where I actually felt chills watching what would unfold and a couple really good moments where something happened that I ended up jumping at, so they must have decided to bring on the better tapes this time."
"This is a great syfy show you could not ask for anything more in one show. Action, creatures and unexplained powers."
I love this series. I purchased seasons one and two. Both seasons are awesome. My sister purchased the remaining two seasons (three and four). This is definitely another winner.
Great show.  Something different than all the other shows out there.  Wish they had more episodes each season.
This is one of the most important seasons of Sanctuary. Because it ties together so many of the questions left unanswered by season 1.
THIS IS A GREAT SERIES FOR THE MONEY. IF YOU LIKE SCI FI WITH SUSPENCE AND SOME MONSTERS IN IT THIS IS THE SHOW FOR YOU. GREAT ACTING AND STORY LINE ESPECIALLY WITH THE LOW BUGET THEY HAVE FOR THESE SHOWS.
Amanda Tapping has created a futuristic (but realistic) show. I wish it had gone on longer (Boo to the networks for cancelling it!). Thank you for 4 wonderful seasons of creativity.
The season I received came from Amazon and was in excellent conditiion and on time. I enjoyed this season very much as I did not have to see the commericals. The extra were interesting
"The shows second season was better than the first, and the third is even better.BUt this was a solid season. I do think the loss of ashley was a shame but that's the way this show went. Amanda Tapping, as usual leads the show with her usual skill , beauty and talent that you would expect of her. The rest of the cast is good too. I do think the big hairy guy is underused. THe dvd set looks fine here with some bonus material."
"This season really ups the ante from season 1. Things get more tense, more sinister and a bit darker. There are still a lot of fun moments and a bit of humour, which makes the show really well-rounded. There is something here for everyone. I imagine this show has quite a good fan-base by now, but if you're late to the party, you will most likely love this show. Especially if you're a sci-fi fan"
The Sanctuary DVDs are well written and well acted.  They keep you interested and wanting to buy the next season.
I am patiently waiting for the next season.  Twists in plots and a few special effects keep us wanting more.
"I had seen several of the later episodes when they aired, but was a bit confused in a few places as to how, when and where. After purchasing Seasons 1 and 2, the blanks are filled in, and while I have found some episodes sort of ordinary, others make it well worth while to watch.The presise isn't new - not matter who or what we are (or look like) we deserve conpassion, but it's taken over the top, and pushes that point. A bit quirky, especially with a reformed Jack the Ripper, and Tesla popping in and, but totally enjoyable.If you like fantasy served up as possiblity, you'll love the series."
I was really hooked to the first season and now a more exciting and action second season has added more questions..Can hardly wait for the thirsd season.
This is one heck of an excellent series. Very unique and creative. Excellent writers to come up with the new episodes. As usual the stupid big wigs at the studio canceld this great show after four seasons. &#34;Shmucks&#34;!!!!
"We streamed a few shows of Sanctuary (not the best Internet connection at our house for streaming) and decided to buy the Blu-ray disc set as soon as it came out.We save watching the Sanctuary shows for when nothing else is on; we don't want the shows to end too soon.We are Stargate fans, and we find Sanctuary to be a wonderful option for science fiction.Why would any person complain? There is nothing else worth watching for people who only receive over-the-air television."
Nice off-shoot of &#34;Greys Anatomy&#34;. The actors characters have diverse personalities and interactions that makes each episode different and interesting to watch. Tends to be a bit too serious at times.
"The series Private Practice just gets more interesting.  It is the type of series where the characters are likable and you cheer them on.  The series can go from a light hearted fun to a really tense act of terror.  Adults will enjoy this series as there is plenty of sex going on and a lot of bed partner change overs.  As new characters develop,  you are anxious to see where their stories will go."
Tosh.0 is the best of the youtube commentary type of shows. I can't believe how funny he is. I just peed.
Watching the episodes with my Prime subscription has been awesome!  Daniel Tosh is hilarious and I laugh out loud while watching him.  He is a gifted comedian and you can tell his crew work hard to find the funniest clips from the internet for our enjoyment. Season 1 and 4 are free for Prime members... I just wish season 2 and 3 were free as well. Daniel Tosh has become a fast favorite of mine... right after Joan Rivers! : )
Tosh is funny. Not very original more commentary/observational but still very funny. Mostly internet videos that are very funny. Funny
"He is brilliant and totally irreverent!  I love Daniel Tosh!  I liked him when I first saw him do stand up, and in this vehicle he really shines!  And as long as there is crap on the Internet he will never ever run out of material :-)"
This guy is so funny. The writers are excellent! IT's non-stop entertainment. Only he can be high-brown and uhm very low-brow at the same time. love it. Can't stop watching.
I chose 5 stars because everyone loves Sesame Street. Very informative and my 3 year old loves the music and lessons taught in the show. Definitely recommend watching.
This is my son's favorite show.  He is overly obsessed with Sesame Street!  I love amazon prime for having these seasons!
"The best in children's programming...no wonder it's been on for thirty or forty years!  It combines humor, puppets, animation, celebrities, music, and ultimately fun to make a worthwhile and educational show!!  Who doesn't love Elmo??  Enough said."
It's Sesame Street what more is there to say
"Great quality! My son is almost 2 and can't sit through a whole episode sometimes so it's great that I can skip through to his favorite characters parts. The quality is very clear, no pauses for buffering. Great entertainment for my son at home or out when were waiting somewhere. I highly recommend!"
"We love Sesame Street. I grew up on it and now my daughter will too. It's entertaining and educational. My daughter just turned two and already knows her letters, colors, and most of her numbers."
My Granddaughter loves this video.  The colors of the characters are so vibrant and they are so animated!!  It's no wonder that Sesame Street has stood the test of time!!  I enjoyed watching the video with her.
"Every body lives Sesame Street. It's nice to have it handy on our kindle, especially when my little guy get up before dawn."
I I like my brothers did to that was a very very very good show... All Kids like to show that ...is a very very very good show.
I have a 2 yr old and she loves the all of the cartoons shows available on the prime channel.
"Fantastic! Great quality, no buffering. My son loves Sesame Street! It's great he can watch it anytime with amazon prime!"
My granddaughter watches this show and series every time she comes over. Great for all ages.Wish II had this when I was a child.
"This is more a blanket review for Sesame Street than any particular season.  All three of my children have enjoyed this show, with my daughter (almost 2) actually seeming to be the one who is going to enjoy it the most.  She enjoys seeing most of the muppets and can name almost all of them, but for some reason she goes crazy over Cookie Monster!  She absolutely loves him.  She is picking up counting and some of the songs, and it manages to keep her attention for almost 10 minutes at a time sometimes, which is huge for a 1-year-old.  The best part is I don't feel guilty for letting her watch it.  I grew up on this show so I'm happy to be able to share it with my children."
My daughter loves Sesame Street and I love that's its quality educational programming. She counts and sings along with them the whole time. Its very interactive and she stays entertained.
too bad it was cancelled - i watched this through the entire season on the tv but missed the last two episodes so it was nice to catch up - too bad they didn't really tie up all the storylines.
I liked  this series a lot. It's too bad it was canceled. I thought it was interesting and entertaining I am glad the woman who played the mother V is now on Homeland.
"Im not a chick but I do enjoy ""drama"", when it's done right, and I absolutely love sci-fi. Real sci-fi not that mystical magic crap that makes up 99% of everything that comes on the SyFy channel. This show does have a bit of a slow start but it is worth the wait. Season 2 is even better. Other than Stargate: Universe ""V"" is the top show on tv!"
"""Hearts and Minds"" is a pivotal episode in the series, adding several key elements for future story lines. No spoilers from me, but as the title suggests, the ""Vs"" are working very hard to win the ""Hearts and Minds"" of the humans and seek to capitalize on the activities of the Fifth Column.This episode also shows us a little more of just how inhuman Ana is with the treatment of humans (with on scene that is not for the squeamish) and even her own daughter.Highly recommended!CFH"
"I hope the show was as good as the pilot.There were a few cheesy moments but, overall the show looks great."
"I can't understand the 7 bad reviews for this show I read but whatever. I'm an average sci-fi fan who thought the 'V' of 25 yrs ago was 'ok' but this updated version is terrific. And the ultimate compliment to it is that in season 1 you get a mere glimpse of what the aliens 'really' look like and yet the show is compelling and creepy and utterly entertaining. The show is totally made by the perfomance of Morena Baccarin who plays 'Anna' the alien Queen. She is so beautiful, creepy, and deadly you almost wind up rooting for her in her quest to wipe out Earth! Her counterpart Elizabeth Mitchell as the FBI Agent on Earth trying to expose the 'V's' is also terrific. It is this battle between two Mothers that actually drives the show. The supporting cast of Joel Gretsch as Father Jack, Scott Wolf as a self serving journalist, and the gorgeous Laura Vandervoort as Anna's daughter are all great additional characters on the show. Post 911 fears; idolatry; wanting someone or something to 'fix' all our problems; these are just a few of the issues dealt with on 'V'. I really, really liked it and didn't think I would. I will definitely purchase season 2 when its available."
"This is a reimagination of the hit 1980 mini-series and though I'm a huge fan of the original, this new version provides more interesting plots and technology. The original mini-series (plus the TV series) didn't have the CG technology we have today, so the use of green screen was heavily used in the 2009 series."
I LOVE this show! Definately one of ABC's best! I'm loving the second season and hope many more are to come!
"This is one of the best science fiction mini-series ever, and it is far better than the 80s original.  What if advanced aliens openly arrived on Earth, professing friendship but with ulterior motives?  This series examines this premise plausibly and with zip.  The pilot grips the viewer immediately, and by the end of it I was hooked.  Elizabeth Mitchell as Erica Evans is, as always for Mitchell, superb. Morena Baccarin, as ""Anna"" the leader of the Visitors, manages a wonderful combination of beauty and creepiness.  Linda Vandervoort as ""Lisa,"" another Visitor well, she is just plain beautiful.  The special effects here are several cuts above what one expects to find on television.  This pilot hooked me on the series and for good reason.  Great entertainment.  RJB."
This show really had me hooked with the way the aliens were moving in an then how the earthlings were awaking to see what was happening and what they were trying to do to counter these actions by the aliens..Cannot wait to see the second season..
"V stands for Visitors and it is one of the best show that you've never watched. Most fans of the original series weren't happy when they learned that V (2009) would be a re-imagining of the franchise as opposed to a modern day re-creation of the show, but that didn't stop them from watching it. V was the highest rated premier of any new show on any network in 2009, but as usual, ABC managed to screw it up. The show premiered with 14 million viewers and kept it's audience over it's first four episodes. ABC, in their infinite stupidity, decided to keep the fans hungry for more, and decided to hold the next eight episodes until nearly four months later! By that time, more than half the audience was gone and the show was barely renewed for a second season, but thank God it was, because as good as the premiere season was, the second season was ten times better! It wasn't until almost a year later that ABC decided to air the second season of V and the numbers were decent, but not enough to motivate the network into renewing the expensive show. The fans launched a huge campaign to try and save the show and to ABC's credit, they did try to sell it to another network, but ultimately failed to do so and V became another Nielsen casualty. As for the show itself, it had some similarities, but was ultimately very different than the original 1983 version. On a random day, at a random time, 29 alien ships appear over major Earth cities. Shortly thereafter, a beautiful woman appears explaining that they are peaceful beings who are here to help us and give the people of Earth some amazing gifts, but as always there's a twist. We learn that Visitors or V's are actually highly aggressive, reptilian creatures, who have been on Earth, disguised as humans, for years. Many have kept their cover, while others have learned to experience human emotion. These emotions have led them to join up with the human and rebel against their queen. The star of the show is Elizabeth Mitchell, better known as Juliette from Lost. She plays an FBI agent who doesn't trust the visitors and wants to find out what they're really doing here and I can honestly say that she makes the show. If you thought she was good as Juliette, wait until you meet Erica, a smart, tough, fearless woman who will do whatever it takes to find the truth and protect her family. She is joined by an outspoken priest, a rebellious V, and a wanted terrorist, as together they form their own resistance cell. The leader of the V's is Anna (Morena Baccarin), and yes, she is the daughter of Diana from the original series, and that's how the two series are linked. Diana was a pretty tough character, but Anna is absolutely ruthless. She has no limits and is willing to do anything to achieve her goals. She trusts no one and won't let anyone get in her way, even the people she loves the most. The first season is really about discovering who the V's are and seeing how ruthless, cunning, and cold they can be. The second season is more about getting inside the resistance and seeing why they are fighting and what they are fighting for. As you all know, I am a huge science fiction fan and I have no problem saying that this may have been the best sci-fi show to come along in the last twenty years. The writing is just incredible and when you pair that with acting that is just utterly mind-blowing, it's a recipe for a show that can't be missed. V had the potential to be the show that changed the very face of TV Science Fiction forever. I am not exaggerating when I say this, because this show really was that good. It is so imaginative and exciting, like a soap opera and action movie combined with the unique and unusual genre that is the essence of science fiction. There wasn't a single episode of this series that I didn't love, the cast is as good as a cast can be, and the writing is the kind of creative stuff that Hugo and Saturn awards are made of. V was the heart and soul of a potential Sci-Fi return to the top of network television, but they made the mistake of putting it on ABC and for that V paid with it's life."
"Once I started watching ""V"" The First Season it became addictive and I had to find out what happends next. I have to say that some of the acting had alot to be desired, but Anna portreys what evil is all about. One has to read and become aware of the details if one is to find the devil. I can't wait until The Second Season is released."
Can someone please tell me how long the extended version is? How any hours and minute? I want to make sure it's the full version which I've heard is better.  Thanks!
This film was extremely well done and historically accurate. One could wish that Hollywood could put forth films of this quality.
"I will admit right upfront that this is not exactly a genre that I spend most of my time viewing. I will watch these if they have any accurate historical relationship to that period. Wow! I think that whoever first spoke the word &#34;epic&#34; had to have just gotten done watching this film. This movie really brought it all to the table. I can't even begin to do this movie honor with my peasant description.What I can do, if you are only now happening upon this experience, is start off by highly recommending that you get the long, international version that comes on 2 discs. I also suggest allotting two nights with which to view and savor all that it will offer. I lent it to a friend who tried to &#34;binge&#34; view it all in one evening and came back squacking that &#34;it was too long&#34;. Last, I always use the sub-titles as most dubbing never sounds right to me.(Except maybe for &#34;Brotherhood of the Wolf&#34; and that was because most of the actors were bi-lingual and dubbed there own parts.)"
"the movie was great. love the historical, the costumes. the acting was great. the story had great historical information. very much enjoyed the heroes."
"Red cliff is a great long movie about war and strategy. It doesn't have any martial arts and isn't based on a real story (i think). But it has lots of action , dialogue, and plot. I can't really say too much other than if you like foreign films dealing with fighing, war, and martial arts this is a must see on amazon. Thanks"
"This is based on a true fact of Chinese history, and John Woo, a master at film-making, has taken full advantage of computer-generated skill to present us with vast armies, flotillas of warships and - of course - one of his favorite stars, Jet Li.The film is awesome and spectacular, and no one has mastered the concept of a moving camera as well. Gone is the stationary tripod, and Woo keeps his camera hovering over and around his characters almost constantly. This is an epic winner."
"They may be speaking Chinese, but you almost feel you can understand the actors. Well done film that held my interest throughout. It is one Hollywood should watch to get back to what they used to do well."
I was expecting this to be along the lines of Curse of the Golden Flower; it was better.  This is a look at warring factions during the end of the Han dynasty.  Everything was good about it.  The only thing that some people may not like is it is in Chinese with English subtitles.
"I loved the fact that this movie was 4 hrs long.It's staying on my shelf.The one flaw was the prop wash when the defending navy set off to torch the enemy ships.One would think that as much CGI was in the film, they could have done a quick erase.That being said ...I liked the 3 Kingdoms Chinese history.There wasn't a lot of wire foo which made the film more believable.You were rooting for the good guys in this movie.I have a huge respect for the cast & crew.Could you imagine filming during a monsoon with your set being washed away every few days?Yeah ... watch the specials."
This movie was spectacular! I love the history. Stunning! If you are a fan of the three kingdoms era then this is a must watch.
"I had been wanting to see the complete cut (International Version - Part I & II) of Red Cliff for a long time now, so I was very happy to find the time to sit down and finally view this nearly 5 hour beast over the period of two weekends. Too bad it never got it's due respect over here and got a proper wide release. Do yourself and favor and don't even bother with the Theatrial Version that is lacking over TWO HOURS of material.John Woo has made some entertaining films, like Face/Off, in the past, but this is his first true masterpiece. All of the actors, locations, individual fights and huge battles are fantastic. The scale of these battles are probably the largest ever filmed. I'm talking Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King on steroids.The only very minor negatives would be that it was somewhat hard at times reading the subtitles for such a long period of time. I wouldn't have it any other way (I hate dubbing), but be prepared to miss what's happening on the screen while you're trying to keep up with the words. It gets a bit easier after the first half hour or so. Also, the martial arts scenes during the battles are very well done and keep things interesting, but they kind of take away from the realism (a single guy slaughtering dozens with ease).The picture quality is right at the top of my growing Blu-ray collection, and the audio is earth shattering through my speaker system. I don't have the time to mess with them, but the special features run almost as long as the movie itself. Very impressive.If you love any kind of historical epics like Braveheart or Kingdom of Heaven, Red Cliff is worth a look at minimum. Just be prepared to have your reading glasses on."
Wow! I'm not one to watch war movies at all. It was the interest in Chinese history that made me watch. An epic!
"I was recommended this movie by a friend.  I saw it in theatrical version but I understand that there is also a ""direcor's cut"" version that is almost three hours long.  Theatrical version was dubbed in English.  I personally prefer subtitles, but for audiences who do not like to read subtitles, this version will be great.Story is set during Chinese Han Dynasty.  One of the top advisors to the emperor is staging a war accusing local leaders of betraying the emperor when in fact, this advisor's desire is to overthrow the emperor and take over leadership of China.  There is also a subplot tot he story.  He is enamored with a beautiful woman, married to another nobleman and the intent is to win the war and claim her as his.What is amazing about the film is the production of the battles.  They are combination of war strategy, martial arts and ""Art of War"" philosophy.  Cast is delivering story that is compelling to watch and mesmerizing in its story plot and wonderful scenery of nature, not to mention costumes that are both elegant and visually pleasing.I absolutely loved this movie and I will strongly recommend it.  It is a combination of chinese history, love story and great action (both military and martial arts).  It is a must see movie."
"Hao Hao!  This is an exceptionally well-crafted movie, from story line to visual execution, I found myself watching it twice. It is a period piece with large battle scenes and close-up individual fight stunts that are awesome. It is a tale of friends who rise to protect their land and the people who live there. Beautifully choreographed and filmed, you will want to own this one. Others have reviewed with great detail, and I will let their comments stand. The five and four star reviews here are excellent. I am a PRIME customer, so I got to watch this free on AMAZON.COM. For $79 a year, you can save a truck load on shipping costs, get your merchandise quicker, and now you get access to great movies and TV shows, FREE!  I have been a PRIME customer since 2006 and I can tell you it has been worth EVERY CENT!"
"I am absolutely Stunned by This Movie directed by John Woo...This film is a beautiful film which I have to say deservers *5* Stars!!!It is a beautiful retelling of the Red Cliff Wars in 208 AD in China.  All of the actors werereally Great.  I wish I had the whole version of this movie, but alas,I only have the American Version that only runs for 148 minutes.  I hear thismovie is actually 4.5 hours long.  But I like the American Version just as well (because you can hear it in English)"
"John Woo's huge historical drama and battle epic, set in 208 A.D., is an international hit from last year and new on Blu-ray.  Available in two versions, the tighter 148 minute cut condenses the original two-part, nearly five hour, depiction of the massive battle that ended the Han Dynasty into a clear overview of the forces that changed the face of China forever.  The longer version allows for much more character development and methods of strategy employed in the conflict of the Han warrior's attack on two warlords that stand in his way.  (Spoiler alert)  An attack that failed when the warlords banded together and defeated the overwhelming forces of the Han emperor in a heroic campaign ""unrivaled in history.""  Woo does justice to the extraordinary scale of the story and the intimacy of the men involved.  The result is a massive and beautiful tapestry of a gargantuan, visually breathtaking, battle.  It is rare for a film to so perfectly capture the emotions and also invoke the visceral vectors of history when a paradigm shifts so completely."
"The film is overwhelming with overkill.  It has everything.  Great stunts, great cinematography, epic (and acrobatic!) battle scenes, more blood than Quentin Tarantino could stomach, some sex, tea ceremonies, Chinese poetry, The Art of War, great acting, great overacting.  Director Woo was out to Wow and he succeeded.  Don't skip the credits.  The cast and crew of this film make the old DeMille &#34;cast of thousands&#34; look sadly understaffed.  If we started making films like this in the USA we could reduce the unemployment rate below 4 percent in no time at all."
"USA knows how to do summer television right. With hits like Psych and Burn Notice, it's difficult for the network to do any wrong. After tackling different sides of the law, USA decided to take on the unique and fascinating world of white-collar crime in their exciting new comedy police procedural White Collar.In White Collar viewers meet con man Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer), a sophisticated white-collar thief who has finally been put behind bars by his archnemesis CIA Special Agent Peter Burke (Tim DeKay), an agent in the white-collar crime division. Just months before his parole comes up, Neal escapes from prison to track down his ex-girlfriend, Kate (Alexandra Daddario). Peter hunts him down, but finds that Neal may be helpful when it comes to solving white-collar crimes. After solving their first case together, Neal joins up with the CIA as a consultant and works with Peter to fight white-collar criminals.The centerpiece of the series is the hilarious relationship between Neal and Peter and the way they play off one another - basically bickering like an old married couple. Though I admit this relationship feel somewhat strained in a few episodes, it cleans up as the show goes on and the actors become more comfortable with the characters. Aside from Neal and Peter, the eccentric, quirky Mozzie (Willie Garson) constantly battles the pair for attention on scene and, honestly, occasionally wins. Garson's whimsical delivery and throughly developed character is one of the highlights of the show, and it'll be interesting to see how he continues to develop. Of course, you can't forget 90210 alum Tiffani Theissen as Peter's wife Elizabeth. Though she seems weak aside from some of the other characters, she's not the typical TV CIA wife and grows into her own lively character as the season goes on.Unlike the popular prime-time franchise CSI, White Collar focuses on sophisticated, high-end crimes such as art theft, forgery, fraud and embezzlement rather than violent crimes of passion.This allows for a fresh type of feel to police procedurals, rather than chasing criminals around New York or LA after discovering a murder, Neal and Peter put their heads together to unravel complex, sophisticated crimes that take a few more brain cells than the average murder.This three disc set is presented in 5.1 Dolby Digital surround sound, but only in English. Subtitles are available in English, French and Spanish.The bonus materials were pretty good for the first season of a new show that USA was taking a gamble on. They include DVD staples such as a gag reel and deleted scenes - my personal favorites - and a handful of features that include interviews with cast and crew and a discussion of the crimes that inspired the episodes ""Pro and Con,"" ""A Cool Cat in the Hat,"" and ""Nothing But the Truth.""White Collar is another wonderful series from USA that breathes a refreshing summer breeze into some exciting television. If you haven't see the first season, you should pick it up before diving into season two, or else you'll miss some important plot points. Don't let this white-hot summer series pass you by."
Very enjoyable season premiere.  I am looking forward to watching the rest of the shows.  As soon as my daughter is asleep.......
I Love this show...White Collar: Season OneMatt Bomer...bought all seasons my daughters favorite show. He is such a cutie.
What a great show. It's interesting and clean. It keeps you thinking of how he will solve the problems. I can hardly wait for season 2 to be released.
"Looks like the USA Network has got another banging hit in its lineup. WHITE COLLAR, an easy-breezy crime drama, swipes heavily from the buddy cop genre, and that this beaten-to-death premise (which owes a lot to 48 HOURS) works for this series is purely because of the appeal of the two leads, and specifically Matt Bomer. This is not to dis his semi-rumpled co-star Tim DeKay, but clearly this show rises or collapses on how effectively Bomer brings the sexy. Tim Dekay - while also charming in a more low-key sort of way - works best as Bomer's exasperated foil.Sophisticated con artist Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer) - convicted of bond forgery but suspected of many other crimes - is hailed as ""quite the Renaissance criminal."" He has only three to four months left to serve in his prison sentence when Kate, the love of his life, breaks up with him and then amscrays for parts unknown. Demonstrating that a maximum-security prison isn't a deterrent if you're crazy in love, Caffrey breaks out of stir to try to find his girl. Except that he gets caught, and gets caught by the same dogged FBI guy who nabbed him the first time, Peter Burke (Tim DeKay).Agent Burke toils away in the white collar crime division in the Big Apple and, before he got pulled away into again running down Caffrey, he was steadily getting baffled by a cunning master forger called the Dutchman. But the long-awaited break surfaces when Caffrey proposes a deal: Caffrey will help Burke catch the Dutchman if Caffrey is remanded to Burke's custody and be out and about in the real world. It's plain to both that the real reason for Caffrey's offer is so that Caffrey can keep looking for his lost love. Burke reluctantly takes the deal. Caffrey gets fitted for a GPS tracking anklet. And off they go to make a serious dent on the Friday Nielsen ratings.WHITE COLLAR debuted this past Friday, October 23rd, and it was so much fun watching it that I went and saw the repeat airing a few hours later. Matt Bomer - who also played Bryce Larkin inChuck - The Complete First Season- is projected to be the show's breakout star, and it looks like he's got the goods. But it helps that the writers saddled his roguish character with a romantic streak. Meanwhile, Tim DeKay holds up his end, making lemonade with his more thankless role. DeKay is really good at doing that ""exasperated and ill-at-ease"" thing, and nothing ruffles his by-the-book FBI agent's feathers quite as much as the ridiculous ease with which Caffrey persistently finagles his way to the cushy things in life. Given that $700 is what it cost to house and feed Caffrey while behind bars, the same amount is allotted to finance his new digs on this shaky ""work release program."" Initially assigned to a very seedy flophouse, Caffrey moments later charms his way into becoming a house guest in an uber-luxurious penthouse. Along the way, he also lands some very sleek threads. He airily describes his new wardrobe as ""classic Rat Pack."" Burke grinds his teeth, yet can't resist sipping from Caffrey's excellent coffee, from sampling a taste of the good life. It's immediately apparent that Matt Bomer and Tim DeKay demonstrate a terrific give-and-go rapport. Their characters aren't exactly overtly adversarial, but they are trying to one-up each other in subtle ways. It's fun to watch.As these two start to build a working relationship, their respective personal lives are touched on. For Caffrey, this involves touching base with his street contact (nicely placed by Willie Garson) and searching for his vanished girlfriend Kate. For the workaholic Burke, it's all about balancing career and marriage, except that the scales tend to tilt in favor of career. Tiffani Thiessen plays Burke's impossibly understanding, long-suffering wife Elizabeth, and since this is Tiffani Thiessen, I'm guessing there are fireworks scheduled ahead for Elizabeth Burke.Like other shows on the USA Network (MONK, BURN NOTICE, PSYCH), WHITE COLLAR flaunts a playful side. In it's key conceit (""It takes a thief...""), it actually shares more in common with a series on TNT, the very goodLeverage: The First Season, and with Spielberg's cool con flickCatch Me If You Can (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition). This isn't one of those cable shows that tries to be ambitious (MAD MEN, SONS OF ANARCHY). And, as great as MAD MEN is, there are times when I'm in the mood to just be entertained and not have to think or analyze things too much or get mired in serious angst. WHITE COLLAR is irresistible comfort food for the mind. I just saw the 90 minute pilot, and I thought: So what if maybe things fall in place a little too conveniently in this show? So what if the unlikely partners develop camaraderie maybe just a tad too effortlessly? So what if the ""collar of the week"" isn't all that compelling? The point is that the show knows its strength rests on showcasing its ridiculously likable two leads. And maybe there's someone on television currently more rakish and dashing than Neal Caffrey. But, for the life of me, I'm drawing a blank."
Matthew Bomer as the lead criminal in White Collar definitely carries the season into incredible crime solving. With some humor and danger the season is exciting and attention grabbing. White Collar crime has never been so exciting.
"I am giving this show five stars---I'm actually on the third season and I still love it. You do feel like you are being conned sometimes, because the plots don't work, and they hope you don't notice.  But it is sooooo good otherwise, I have to go with a full five stars.  The characters are rich and believable and adorable. The characterization details in the dialogue are amazing. The con details are interesting.  There's no gross yuk stuff---like dead bodies staring at you.  I hate that! It's really a great show!"
"IF ONLY NBC, USA Network's parent network, could harness the creativity of their cable programming. With series such as ""Burn Notice,"" ""Royal Pains,"" ""In Plain Sight"" and, now, ""White Collar,"" USA is the turn-to station for entertainment.The chemistry sells it. Matt Bomer (""Chuck"") plays handsome con artist/thief Neal Caffrey. Tim DeKay (""Carniv&agrave;le"") is the by-the-book FBI agent, Peter Burke, a likable Joe Friday responsible for catching Caffrey twice. The agent makes a deal with the thief, allowing Caffrey to serve out the remainder of his four year sentence under Burke's supervision, helping the FBI solve high-end crime. Together they bust stock scams, art theft, diamond heists and bond forgeries.Sounds simple, right? Wrong - Caffrey has a personal agenda he plays out while working with his new friends. He's got a two mile movement radius on the ankle tracker he's forced to wear and he makes good use of it.Caffrey and Burke are aided by a merry band of characters including conspiracy fanatic/thief Mozzie (Willie Garson) and Burke's smart and beautiful wife Elizabeth (Tiffani Thiessen). Diahann Carroll shows up as a recurring guest star, as lovely as ever. In face, every co-actor is superb, contributing their own unique touch to each caper.The 14-episode, three-disc set looks great on Blu-ray. Filmed in the Big Apple, settings are clean and crisp. Color is good and skin tones spot on with a decent wash of grain. Fashion is stunning and you can learn more about the choices in the featurette, ""Cool Cat in a Hat."" Sporting a vintage Rat Pack look complete with fedora and tie clasp, Caffrey could be Carrie Bradshaw's twin brother. DeKay and Thiessen look sharp, too.A DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 allows witty patter to shine while offering some ambient, surround sound city noise. There aren't many big special effects outside of the season finale.Additional extras include Jeff Eastin talking about casting his two main characters, a few good natured commentaries, a gag reel and deleted scenes. Series tech consultant, Tom Barden, a former FBI agent, talks about his work in ""Nothing But the Truth."" Fascinating stuff  but it should have been longer.Highly recommended!"
"If you like stylish, upbeat white crime shows which are based in NYC, this show is a winner.  With original plots, charming characters, gorgeous sets and scenery, this series is great escapism.  I'm always looking for mysteries/thrillers to treadmill to, and this one will supply many hours of great watching."
"This show has it all with the sexiest guy around! You know Matt Bomer! He is smart, clever and all those things wrapped up in a Man body. The show is great with all the other characters mixed in. You should get a copy and see for yourself."
I started watching this with some concern.  I have seem so many detective type shows and am really sick of them.  But this show is different it has a great cast and the storylines are excellent.  I loved Season One and can't wait for Season two.  If you are not sure about this DVD then I think it is definitely worth purchasing it as you will not regret it.  I know with most shows like this i.e. The Mentalist the storylines are paper thin and you know within minutes who is responsible for the crime.  This is not the case here.  Do yourself a favour and try this DVD.
"I've long been a fan of television shows being released on DVD. For one, it gives me a chance to catch up on series I may have missed for whatever reason when they first began. Another reason is I hate the cliff hanger that keeps me wondering what happens next only to miss the next episode for some reason like, say, real life interfering. So series released on DVD are a plus for me. And when the series is a great one, like WHITE COLLAR, it makes it even better.The set up for the show seems simple, but then that seems to be the case for most shows. We are presented with a charismatic con man named Neal Caffrey played with charm by actor Matthew Bomer. Neal starts the show out in prison, placed there several years earlier by FBI agent Peter Burke (Tim DeKay). With only three days left till his release, Neal escapes and Peter, the expert on Neal Caffrey, is on the case.It doesn't take long for Peter to find Caffrey but at the same time he wonders why, with only three days left, did he escape? In reviewing the tapes of Caffrey's visitors he sees Caffrey's girlfriend stop in and appear to break up with him. Could this have been the reason?Talking with Caffrey, Neal makes Peter a proposition. He knows that Peter is in the middle of an intense investigation for the white collar crime unit. If he will get the FBI to release him with an ankle monitor in place, he will offer Peter the assistance he needs to take on the latest criminal he has his eye on. Of course they agree and the series is set. Caffrey is a partner with the FBI in helping to take on criminals, the simple explanation for the show.But there is more to it than just that. The elusive reason for Caffery escaping and searching for his old girlfriend Kate. More was at play here than even we as viewers and especially Peter realized. And Neal is searching for clues to her whereabouts with each episode. Helping him along the way is his trusted con man/thief friend Mozzie played by Willie Garson who does a great job.Each episode of the series takes on a new white collar crime and criminal as the FBI attempts to catch them. And along the way we get to know more about both Neal and Peter. Neal is the sophisticated art connoisseur, the lover of fine things, the man about town. Peter is the trustworthy, loyal, hard working, dedicated FBI agent who plays it straight all the way. Well until Neal starts to rub off on him just a bit.Also in the mix is actress Tiffani Thiessen who most will remember from SAVED BY THE BELL. She's grown into an accomplished actress and it shows here where she plays Peter's wife. She took takes a liking to Neal Caffrey but not in a sexual way, more in an admiration for his love of life and the comradeship that she sees developing between Neal and her husband.The chemistry between the two leads makes this show not just believable with a premise that can't be, but enjoyable to watch as well. Both are good looking actors but Bomer has that charming leading actor appearance while DeKay offers that solid FBI agent appearance. They suit their roles perfectly and the banter back and forth between these two characters, as well as their growing fondness for one another, makes for interesting viewing.The secret to making a great TV series is to get the viewers to care about the characters involved. That happens with these characters. You learn to like them. You learn to care about them. You learn to hope that Neal eventually does find Kate and who it was that was making her leave him. In so doing, you find yourself wanting to see more of these folks and that's the real treasure in finding a series on DVD that works. Not only do you enjoy the discs you own, you find yourself setting the DVR to record the new episodes of the series and become fans.  Thus the DVD release becomes the best promotional tool out there. That is if the series is good and this one is fantastic."
a very original series... can't recall anything like it in all my years of watching hollyrock.  great views of nyc and matt bomer is exceptional as an art thief!
"Enjoyed it very much.  Good stories, different from the usual fare.  Acting is very good and it is all very enjoyable."
"90% of this shpw is better then good. It really gets your attention. Personally, I like  Kate!But that is my choice. Buy the set you will  not be sorry."
She had an interesting life and I was pleased to hear about her being defended against her daughter. The daughter who wanted an acting career and a rich Daddy. Considering the fact that she was an adopted child I do not believe that she appreciated Joan Crawford as a mother or anything else. She was a self made woman. She deserves credit.
"By no means is this the best documentary on legendary movie actress Joan Crawford it is nevertheless an interesting insight into how Lucille Leseur became Joan Crawford and went from nothing to being the highest-paid actress in Hollywood during the 1930's. With some rare interviews with those who knew her ""Always The Star"" concentrates more on Joan's acting career than her personal life. Having shot over 80 films, numerous television guest-star spots, commercials and winning the coveted Academy Award, Joan Crawford is cemented as one (if not the best) actresses in Hollywood history."
"I thought this was excellent given the amount of time involved. Very good overview of the movie, which I also like. If there is a problem, it would be that it may give away too much of the plot. Katherine Heigl makes both this featurette and the movie worth watching. I also feel that, while the movie is a comedy, a lot of people should look at with just a bit of seriousness, as well, especially the 1st half of it. There is a lot of truth there about how men and women are hard wired for certain attitudes, and wishing it was different won't change it."
"good movie, like cast. shows how different women and men look at things.  Great, funny love story.  yea yea yea"
This was a little slow at times be patient though because  I found it to be very entertaining. you will enjoy it.
This man has transformed so many characters with personalities and voices to match that it makes for an extremely entertaining show.
"A truly enjoyable, funny and educational ( the use of 3 D printers to make his accociates.). Sometimes his associates seem life like, of course, that is the idea."
"During my husbands recovery from minor surgery, I placed The Jeff Dunham Show on our watchlist.  My husband enjoyed watching and it really cheered him during his recovery.  Laughter is the best medicine."
"This show is hiiiilarious! The interaction and relationship between all the characters will leave you laughing out loud. Even if you don't watch football or participate in online football leagues, you will be able to follow along and appreciate the humor of this show."
"The League is by far one of the funniest shows on tv. If you dont watch football then dont bother really, but if you are a football fan and a fantasy footballer, you will relate to everything this show has to offer. AMAZING!!"
"The league is a extra funny show. Even if you don't like sports, or football, you can't go wrong with all the laughs this show offers. I really enjoy it and would suggest you check it out for yourself."
"I was reluctant to start watching this show until i caught a few episodes at a buddies house. I immediately went home, logged on and bought it. The show is clever, and has a good slap-stick element to it. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys well written, slightly dry comedies. All my coworkers and I love it and we catch all the new episodes. I work in a research lab, which goes to show The League is not for sports fans/ meat-heads only."
Really funny show. Nick kroll never disappoints :) I don't follow sports but this show is still hilarious . I recommend it
"Before I accidently caught an episode of The League, I thought I knew 3 things:  I hate football and don't think Nick Kroll and Paul Scheer are funny or great actors.So imagine my surprise when I kept sitting thru repeated viewings of the same episode with my chin on the floor!  Where the heck did this gem of a comedy come from?!  I still hate watching football but these guys just crack me up with their enthusiasm for the game but more than that, this ensemble of actors make this show work.  My funny bone they definitely tickle.  And Nick and Paul are hilarious in their roles!  I now see them in a completely different light.I finally figured out that the girl who plays Nick's wife was the girl from My Name is Earl.  ( don't you hate that - when you know you know the face but can't quite place it?)  But my favorite chracter is the guy who plays her brother, ""Taco.""  Not sure which season/episode it was but when he started singing/rapping I was hooked.This series is pure entertainment and whoever does the writing on it deserves all the praise he gets and more."
"If you enjoy a good comedy then this is a must have for your collection!  Hysterical!  After watching season 1, my friends and I set up a Fantasy Football League and heckled each other all season long.  Can't wait to see season 3, season 2 was great as well."
I was actually shocked at how funny this show is.  It's basically guys getting together with guys and talking smack like guys do.
"Serious Moonlight starring Meg Ryan and Timothy Hutton is a very funny, unexpected dark comedy. Ryan and Hutton are two of my favorite actors, I just wish Ryan would give up the Botox, ugh! Hutton's character wants a divorce and Ryan's character will do anything in her power to keep him from running away with a much younger woman played by Kristen Bell. Serious Moonlight was a film I just happen to stumble upon by accident, so glad I checked this movie out. Very original, enjoy!"
"I never would have guessed Serious Moonlight would live up to the excitement based on the description but I was totally wrong.  Even more surprisingly, the way the story eventually changes is somewhat complex and I was *not* expecting a degree of sophistication to the writing whatsoever.  A wife (played by Meg Ryan) duct tapes her husband to a toilet after he tells her that he's been seeing another woman and that the two of them plan to run away together on a trip the next day.  So... what does Meg Ryan do?  Why, she smacks her husband over the head with a flower pot, knocking him out cold on the floor!  When he awakes, he's wrapped up tight in tape and unable to move.This is definitely a comedy intended for women since the storytelling and atmosphere feels sort of feminine.  However due to the amazingly well-written way the storyline unravels with several twists and turns (including the mistress eventually playing a more important role and, more importantly, robbers coming into the picture to wreak havoc when they spot a golden opportunity to do so) I have no choice but to declare Serious Moonlight a comedy that *both* men and women can enjoy.  The many twists and turns guarantees that both men and women will be surprised and laughing hysterically at the way these events unfold.  Serious Moonlight manages to successfully weave a subtle touch to the story together in a way that both men and women will be able to appreciate.I really don't want to spoil more to the storyline since I feel I'd be giving too much away.  It's the kind of comedy that demands the viewer to watch every aspect carefully so as not to miss anything.  I just think it's hilarious that Meg Ryan ties her husband to a toilet and tries to reminisce about their many years in a relationship and doing so in a serious way assuming the husband will be able to think contently and reasonably without any concern for the fact he's tied up, LOL!  This is just one aspect of the storyline- the second half of the movie changes the situation entirely.  Great writng and highly recommended."
I love Meg Ryan and Timothy Hutton - I wish both actors were in more movies.  I didn't know what to expect with this movie but didn't think I would enjoy it so much.  Meg and Timothy really clicked in this movie and I think it is now one of my favorites.
This is a great movie for us &#34;old timers&#34; who can remember the &#34;Lil Rascals shows&#34; I loved to watch these. I am sorry that she passed away but living to be 85 was a great long life.
"This is a cute short film from the Great Depression era. It's easy to imagine a theatre full of rumpled children laughing at the slapstick gags and irrepressible  pandemonium. 4 yr. old Shirley Temple has a minor role, but she's a dimpled dynamo in banana curls. Watch her steal the antics-filled radio show segment with her sparkling Satchmo impression on tiptoe. Lots of wacky mayhem served up with squirting donuts, a one-room schoolhouse and a side of radio days nostalgia."
"This movie is hilarious from the first moment. Shirley Temple shines with laughing point after point, the music is great. And the moments of humor are simply great -- and even the kids can watch it."
"This Star Trek should serve as a template for any director making a multi-million dollar science fiction film.  In addition to special effects, this film has character development, humor, human failings, a plot, some coherence, suspense and so on.  Imagine how many other science fiction movies, including the previous Star Treks could benefit from including these things.The cliches--and there are many--mostly have to do with the Star Trek franchise.  And that's fine.  Except for Spock's father (who, unlike Spock, went to Cambridge) this movie avoids the classically trained British actors and corny dialog.  Checkov probably should have gone to a language coach, though.I think this Star Trek benefitted from being so family friendly.  I, for one, did not miss the state-of-the-art depiction of torture or parasitic disease.  To each his own.So the universe is still dangerous (or it was, I suppose).  But there is also bravery, humility, love, and a little humor.  Even poor Captain Pike seems to have a new lease on life...for now."
"I'm going to say this up front: I am not a Trekkie.  I've seen one Star Trek film, and to be honest I can't remember which one it was (one of the 90's ones); I do remember I wasn't overly impressed.  Not my cup of tea, you could say.  However, I've enjoyed J.J. Abrams's films (don't watch TV; sorry folks!), and loved Chris Pine in SMOKIN' ACES, so I figured STARK TREK was a sure-fire delight.  I was right.I won't rehash the plot, because while there IS one, it's so convoluted that I couldn't possibly hope to get it right; it involves time travel, and a sinister-looking Eric Bana (underused and underwritten, unfortunately) who has a grudge against pretty much everyone, but especially Spock, played with jaw-dropping aplomb by Zachary Quinto (and also a much-welcomed Leonard Nimoy; I told you this was a weird plot).  Along for the ride are names that Trekkies will recognize: Dr. Bones McCoy (Karl Urban at his finest); Uhura (Zoe Saldana); Scottie (Simon Pegg, also underused); Sulu (John Cho); and others.  Bruce Greenwood is a delight as always as the rugged Captain who belies in Kirk no matter what, and Anton Yelchin manages to steal most of his scenes as Checkov (much as he did in the recent TERMINATOR film).The other major star here are the special effects, and I must say, they are not lacking.  This is a heart-pounding ride, an action film in the old-school vein of quick wit and terrific explosions.  What keeps it from drowning in its twisted plot is the script, Abrams's spot-on direction, and Chris Pine as the lead role.  Pine shows he can be an action star with depth, a genuinely good actor in a role usually reserved for those with more muscles than talent.  Overall, STAR TREK is a pure and utter delight; it's not quite a classic, though I'm sure sci-fi fans my argue for it (and I won't stop them).  I'm not sure how it appeals to Trekkies, but for someone like myself, who's new to the series, this film is a kick-a** ride, and not one to be missed."
"This Star Trek movie tells how the crew got its start and gives us a glimpse of the characters we have come to love as they were getting their starts in Star Fleet. It does a very nice job of tying things together and setting the stage for some possible new movies that would tell about earlier adventures of the original cast of characters. The movie brings in one of the original characters, Spock, where the young version and the old version meet.The casting was very successful in capturing some of the mannerisms of the original cast; I was particularly impressed with Karl Urban's portrayal of Bones, he did an outstanding job of capturing the accent and mannerisms used by DeForest Kelley in the original series.An effort is made to explore the personal strengths and weaknesses of the characters that help the viewer, who is familiar with the series, to see how they came to be and accomplish what the later stories reveal.The Blu-ray version offers the good video and audio that one expects from the medium and the story is filled with fast paced action that holds one's attention.The financial success of this movie seems to guarantee sequels starting in 2012 according to reports I've read; this seems to bode well for all Star Trek fans!"
"I didn't know what to expect with this remake, but I was totally impressed with the feel of it.  The casting was perfect!  The story was ""classic trek"" which should make any fan of the original television series more than pleased.  There were a few odd additions  (like the quirky relationship between Uhura and Spock, the fate of Spock's mother, and the ultimate demise of the Romulan villain) that didn't gel with what I remembered from the original, but hopefully if this remake kick-starts a new resurgence of sequels, these odd additions may evolve and/or be explained in later movies.Overall, this is an awesome remake amidst a dismal gallery of very bad ones in a variety of genres.  They got it so right... thank goodness!  Enjoy and of course, Live Long and Prosper!"
"I was watching the night the original Star Trek premiered on NBC, wrote several letters to the network advising them to renew it for a second and third season and attended the first Star Trek convention at the Statler-Hilton in New York in 1971.  I've been a Star Trek fan for over 40 years.  And I love this new film.  I saw it the first day it opened, later on an Imax screen and on an airplane flight to Las Vegas.It is a great film from its incredibly exciting pre-credit opening to its conclusion.  Yes it does change the history and continuity of Star Trek.  However it has added an excitement to Star Trek that has not been seen since Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.I'm not going to go into detail about why I enjoy it so much:others have gone over that ad nauseum.  The entire cast is terrific, although I must point out Karl Urban who nails DeForest Kelley as Dr McCoy better than I could possibly have imagined.The picture and sound quality of the blu-ray is terrific, the extra features are good and the deleted scenes help flesh out scenes left in the film.  (I have no doubt Paramount will be releasing another version of the DVD and blu-ray with additional scenes sometime in the near future.)In conclusion, whether you are a Star Trek fan or not, if you'd like an all-around terrific film and you haven't seen this one, you really should."
I saw this movie 7 times in the theater.  I absolutely loved every second of it and will definitely be purchasing it when it comes out on DVD.  I highly recommend Star Trek to everyone. This movie exceeded all my expectations and more.My favorite characters in the movie are Jim Kirk and Bones. Both of the actors who portrayed said characters did an amazing job and in my opinion made the movie even more amazing. All of the other people in the movie were also very good too.  I especially liked Scotty.  He is a hoot!What are you waiting for?  Go and see the movie!!!
"Fantastic movie!!!! The actors have down pat the mannerism and characteristics of the original cast. Great story, great acting, and great pacing!!!"
"First, if you've never seen a Trek film, now maybe the time...this is a solid movie, Trek or not...visually stunning, a wild paced trip with J.J.Abrams superb character banter.Star Trek is such a cultural icon and so a part of the collective unconsciousness that even a passing familiarity is plenty enough to enjoy the new TREK MOVIE. J.J.Abrams of TV's LOST & the Mission Impossible series shows how the famous crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise first comes aboard to explore strange new worlds. Talk about ""no win scenario""...the big question in the minds of fans and non-fans alike: can younger actors fill these enormous space boots.The answer is yes, but with a major role for the original Spock, Leonard Nimoy, time traveling of course, there's no need to worry about the absence of the original crew.Chris Pine's take on impulsive space cowboy James T. Kirk is no SNL parody of Shatner's portrayal but recognizable (although as the climax draws near he scores some very Capt. Kirk classic moments ""I've got your gun.""). Zachary Quinto a.k.a Sylar-Spock is perfect as a young Vulcan (with a girlfriend!). Karl Urban is dead on a Leonard ""Bones"" Mcoy with maybe the coolest intro in the film. Uhura is played by Zoe Saldana who is a great likeness of young Nichelle Nichols, but with so much more to do, than poor Nichelle. The same can't be said for Chekov, Sulu and Scott who had less important places in the big picture, but were each well played, Simon Pegg's Scotty was great fun.Without given too, much away, some answers....Does a ""Red Shirt"" die? Ho yeah...Does Kirk tear his shirt? Nah...Does Bones declare someone ""Dead, Jim?"" Sorta...Nerve Pinch? Got `em....Warp Speed?  The Best ever!!!....Beam ins and outs? Yes and much more (can you say space-dive?)...How about the KOBAYASHI MARU test? I prequel has to have it right? Yes, it is in there and may even live up to expectations, too!Due to interference by a future Romulian, Nero, play brilliantly by Eric Bana, an alternate timeline is created. While strikingly similar to the original Trek, the movie ends with many things already clearly different from the series (like Capt. Pike's final fate).  In doing this 2 things are ultimately accomplished 1.) many Prequel / Series discontinuities are dispersed due to interference by Nero. 2.) the future of the Trek film franchise can continue without fear of rewriting any aspect of the show or films using the new cast.The Star Trek prequel hopefully will herald the reboot of the Star Trek franchise, it sure has the potential. Star Trek Lives!"
"The movie is riveting and holds strong all the elements of the original Star Trek series and movies.  It begins with an attack of an amazing outside-the-box Romulan Ship with a tattooed seethingly evil Captain Nero (Eric Bana).After the attack, one of the survivors, the infant James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is shown as a wild risk taker growing up in Iowa.  He rides wild clunker cars and has no fear.  Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) meets Kirk as an adult and recommends that he join the Starfleet.  This gives him the opportunity to meet Spock (Zachary Quinto) and all the familiar faces in the Star Trek fictional universe.The cast is top notch and their acting shows they have studied the history of the series.  Character essence flows well and gives great satisfaction - like comfort food for the soul.The action and story are fabulous - nothing too long or drawn out - just enough.  The movie is top notch."
"Many modern films begin to show their seams in high definition, but this one looks even better. The ship just looks real. Also, the sound quality is impeccable. I owned the DVD, but decided to get the Blu Ray since we got a new TV. The only downside is that I wasn't able to find a DVD/Blu Ray Combo pack."
"The original Star Trek series took time to establish itself as the premiere franchise it is today. The movies steadily improved the characters and special effects, building on a large canon of established Trek lore.  The best movies gleefully embraced this rich history; the failures ignored or contradicted it. Star Trek is simply too big to reinvent, and J.J. Abrams knows it.  So he did the next best thing by tweaking the established universe of Star Trek just enough to carve out his own little patch for the movie.This is the beginning of Star Trek re-imagined as a futuristic Earth that incorporates the go-go 60s with iPod style.  We see Kirk as a kid on the farm, Spock struggling with his half-Vulcan nature and Bones becoming a crotchety windbag--which, it becomes quickly apparent, he always was. We witness Kirk's solution to the Kobiyashi Maru, Spock's acceptance to Starfleet, and the construction of the Enterprise.  In short, this is a true and proper launch of a Star Trek movie, from the beginning, so that all those non-Trekkies won't feel like they missed out...But if you are a non-Trekkie, you missed out.  There are so many nods to Trek lore that my head nearly exploded. SPOILER RED ALERT.Sulu fences! There's a splash of light over the captain's eyes when he sits on the bridge, just like the original series. Red shirts die! The same sounds beep and bleep in the background, from the sensors to the transporters. There are several Wrath of Khan references, from Spock's famous last words to creepy worms that take control of your brain. There's even old-style Romulans and Klingons.  Fans worried that Abrams was going to remake the series in such a way as to make it unrecognizable can rest easy; this is the Star Trek we know and love, dusted off and buffed to a 21st century shine.The plot involves time travel, a guest cameo, and references to the central conceit of the series: Spock follows the rules, Bones doesn't, and Kirk floats above it all, waffling between the two ideologies and blazing his own path as his ego suits him. The movie has no qualms about portraying Kirk as a womanizing jerk or using him as the butt of some hilarious slapstick. It also isn't afraid to push the envelope with the aliens, going beyond makeup to ensure they're just unnerving enough for you to notice them even if the rest of the crew doesn't. This is more than just a new Star Trek, it's Star Trek done right with a bigger budget.There are some flaws.  The villain is one dimensional. Uhura's headstrong personality has to carry the burden of embodying all females in Trek, which begins to grate. Winona Ryder (age 38) seems to have wandered onto the set to play Spock's (Zachary Quinto, age 32) mother. And an uncharacteristically vengeful tactics from the good guys at the end of the movie borders on ""ludicrous speed.""But you know what? I forgive all that.  This movie made Trek worth watching all over again and reminded us why it's okay to travel through time and space, encounter green alien hotties, and bed them.  Because it's FUN."
"J.J. Abrams has done the impossible by making a Star Trek film for everyone. It will appeal to long time fans (most anyways) and the unintiated alike. What really surprised me is how this is more of a character driven film than one relying just on action and SFX. The casting is outstanding, especially Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock. Pine manages to get the essence of Kirk, but not being a parody of William Shatner. He is cocky, yet you know there is intelligence that goes along with his recklessness. Before watching this movie I couldn't think of anyone who combines the looks and smarts to play Spock other than Leonard Nimoy, but Quinto manages to pull it off brilliantly. Karl Urban made a very good Dr. McCoy early on, but they seemed to forget about his character as the movie progressed. The rest of the cast is good, but they are not given that much to do. I just heard on the news that most have signed on for two more movies, so perhaps they will all get their due in future installments. Eric Bana was the weak link here for me. He just wasn't a very intimidating villain. Maybe it was more of the character than his actual acting, but he is not even close to the legend that is Khan. Leonard Nimoy's role was pivotal and not just some cheap cameo, so that was nice.The story, while not mind blowing, is clever enough. For a time travel plot, it is rather easy to follow and I like how they made it an alternate reality to cover up any inconsistencies with the past series.The music (loved how they used the old theme music over the end credits) and SFX are very good as expected. There is also quite a bit of humor that works most of the time. My theater was pretty much full and everyone seemed to be having a good time during and after the movie ended. Star Trek is a well made summer blockbuster that has wide appeal and will likely spawn at least two sequels. So beam up to your local theater and prepare to boldy go where no man has gone before.4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars"
"Yes folks, Star Trek is back and back in a big way.  Be warned that spoilers are ahead, but considering the plot of J.J. Abrams' reboot of Gene Roddenberry's legendary franchise has been pretty much out in the open, I'm probably not saying anything that you don't already know anyway.  It all begins with the vengeful Romulan Nero (Eric Bana) coming back in time to wreak havoc on the Federation, so much so that it impacts the history and continuity that die hard Trekkies will no doubt find bones to pick with.  From that point forward, we are introduced to the young and reckless James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) who is convinced by Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) to enlist in Starfleet.  It isn't long before Kirk is at odds with Spock (Heroes' Zachary Quinto); who himself is an outcast among his own Vulcan people, and shares a rocky relationship with his Vulcan father Sarek (Ben Cross) and human mother Amanda (Winona Ryder).  The dynamic and groundwork laid of Kirk and Spock's relationship is what helps make Abrams' take on Star Trek so good, as he modernizes nearly everything that Trek fans hold dear (seeing young Kirk driving to the Beastie Boys' ""Sabotage"" may be overdoing it a bit, but hey...), yet he manages to pay enough homage to the original series while putting his own spin on things.  Pine and especially Quinto are surprisingly wonderfully cast and Kirk and Spock, as is Karl Urban as McCoy, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, Simon Pegg in an all too brief turn as Scottie, and Bana as Nero; who is undoubtedly the best Trek film villain since Khan.  John Cho as Sulu and Anton Yelchin as Chekov are fine in their relatively small turns as the film moves along with a nicely brisk pace, but the real surprise manages to be the emotional chords that Abrams pulls; whether it be the destruction of the planet Vulcan or the appearance and guidance of old Spock (Leonard Nimoy), who foretells his past self and Kirk alike that their bond and friendship is more than paramount.  With brilliant effects, epic space battles, and overall dynamite action scenes; this is the Star Trek for a new generation that we have all wanted and rightly deserve.  Now here's hoping that Abrams can manage to pull another rabbit out of his hat with the series someday further down the line."
Awsome movie and the soundtrack is the best to test any new speaker or subwoofer for its good base effects definitely recomend.
"I am older and grew up with the original,needless to say Star Trek is a huge part of my life.When this one came out - I admit I was sceptical, but it held it's ground.People say it's rehashed, - maybe in a small way, let's keep in mind it IS Star Trek and changing it 360 wouldn't make it Star Trek.I've friends that don't like it because it has different actors, I find that to be really, really lame.Not only are most of them dead or too old to act, but if you want to move on things have to change, after all that is what life is all about and I am grateful to J.J.Abrams for keeping it going.They will ease into their own I am sure and am looking forward to it.I hope they keep all the same actors, specially Zachary Quinto - he is the perfect double.They could not have found a better actor for Spock , he is perfect for the part.While I love all the original actors and stories - I am glad that Star Trek lives on.If People talk about Star Trek - it is because it was an extraordinary idea, one that is still valid today, and none of the Actors ( past or present) will ever be forgotten.It's a legacy that I am all too willing to support, Live long and prosper!"
"J.J. Abrams....nothing else has to be said, but i will. Usually do overs don't come close, having said that, this is one of my favorite sci-fi's, or any movie for that matter. The minute this went down in price, I was on it. Try it, you'll like it !!"
Great reboot of the Star Trek Franchise which deserves to be seen on Blu-ray. A great deal for under ten dollars.
A new story to an old fan loving show.  This movie was definitely worth the watch.  The actors were pretty much true to the original charactors. I was very pleased with this outing into familiar territory.
I love this movie! It had great special effects and a wonderful story line too! It is a movie that should not be missed!
"On the one hand, when a studio bankrolls a remake or a 'reboot' in this case, I feel the need to lament the lack of creativity, the lack of original thought at work in the Hollywood studio system. Can't anyone come up with anything new and original? But when the 'reboot' is as good as ""Star Trek"", I kind of wish J.J. Abrams was at the helm of them all. His new film adds richness and depth to a once ailing mythology bringing it back to life by going back to the beginning.""Star Trek"" introduces us to Kirk (Chris Pine, ""Bottle Shock""), Spock (Zachary Quinto, TV's ""Heroes""), Bones (Karl Urban), McCoy (Simon Pegg, ""Shaun of the Dead"", ""Hot Fuzz"", ""Run, Fatboy, Run""), Sulu (John Cho, ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle""), Chekhov (Anton Yelchin, ""Alpha Dog"") and Uhuru (Zoe Saldana, ""Drumline) on the first voyage of the U.S.S. Enterprise. As this is ""Star Trek: Origins"", if you will, writers Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzmann (""Transformers"", ""Cloverfield"") and director J.J. Abrams (TV's ""Lost"" and ""Alias"", ""Mission Impossible III"", ""Cloverfield"") have taken some liberties with the timeline and stayed true to other parts of the mythology. What this mix accomplishes is to give us a fresh take on these characters, allowing us to see how they got started and how they would become what they would become.A rebellious kid, Jim Kirk (Pine) likes to race vehicles he doesn't own in his Iowa hometown. One day, he enters a bar filled with Starfleet Cadets and starts hitting on a beautiful woman. But Uhuru (Saldana) isn't interested and asks him to leave. A fight quickly develops and Kirk gets a bloody nose before Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) puts and end to the bar brawl. He sits Kirk down and explains he knows about him, about his father and challenges Kirk to join Starfleet and do better than his dad did. His dad died trying to save as many lives as possible when the U.S.S. Kelvin was under attack. The next morning, Kirk takes up the challenge and meets McCoy (Urban) a doctor who is also headed to Starfleet for training. Three years later, Kirk is taking the infamous Kobayashi Morou test again. And passes. Much to the astonishment of the test's creator, Commander Spock (Quinto), causing the two to become, at best, rivals. Just as an academic tribunal is called to investigate the charges against Kirk, Starfleet receives a distress signal from Vulcan. They quickly dispatch the recruits to new ships and eventually, everyone ends up on the Enterprise under Captain Pike's leadership. As they head out to assist the other star ships, Kirk becomes convinced they are about to enter an ambush and proves to be right. A Romulan mining vessel, led by Nero (Eric Bana, ""Hulk"", the upcoming ""Funny People"") is drilling into the core of Vulcan, causing seismic activity and he has just blown up the rest of the ships. The Enterprise takes evasive action, but Pike is soon summoned to the enemy vessel leaving Commander Spock in charge. He appoints Kirk his First Officer. The first order of business is to stop the drill and then save the Captain. But Nero proves a persistent villain and when he reveals what he really wants, everyone kicks into overdrive and start working together, becoming the team we all remember. Will Kirk and Spock learn to work together? Will everyone find their place on the Enterprise? Will this vessel staffed largely by new recruits be able to fight off the bent-on-revenge Nero?Abrams has achieved the right balance of reverence to the characters and universe of these people while taking them to new and exciting places, bringing them alive for a new generation. It's really quite remarkable work when you think about all of the other needless remakes and reboots littering the Hollywood landscape.All of the characters seem to have the trademark mannerisms of the television cast. Pine develops a telling swagger and bravado, very similar to William Shatner's portrayal of the role. More importantly, he doesn't display these mannerisms from the beginning; he grows into them as he develops the courage and bravery he will become known for. A friend saw a copy of Entertainment Weekly with Quinto as Spock on the cover sitting on my desk. ""How do you feel about them using a CGI character in this film?"" After a brief conversation, I learned he felt the character had to be CGI because he looked so similar to Leonard Nimoy's Spock, only a lot younger. I explained that an actor was playing the role and he was just amazed. Quinto was, reportedly, the first person hired for the film and he does an excellent job of making the character his own, while paying homage to Nimoy. Karl Urban seems to have a lot of fun paying the perpetually cross Dr. Bones McCoy, again adopting and paying homage to many of the character quirks DeForest Kelly used in his portrayal. Zoe Saldana is good as Uhuru. She and Kirk meet in the bar the night before they leave to join Starfleet and he continues to pine for her throughout the film. Her Uhuru is a little more fully integrated into the plot, a little more active, involving herself with Kirk and Spock. Anton Yelchin has some fun moments as the very young Chekhov. And John Cho. Well known for silly, raunchy comedies shows he may have some action chops on him. Sulu is also new to the Enterprise and has some growing pains. When Captain Pine picks Kirk and Sulu to lead a mission to stop a Romulan drilling device, they team up on a pretty terrifying and thrilling mission. And Sulu's unique skill set quickly comes in to play.And that, is your crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise. Wait! Who am I forgetting? Ah yes, Scotty. Scotty is played by Simon Pegg, a British comedian who stars in a series of memorable films he co-wrote and co-directed (the best is ""Shaun of the Dead"") and he is clearly having a lot of fun playing the role. At one point, he shouts James Doohan's trademark phrase ""I'm giving her all she's got"" and it's nice to hear it even if it seems drowned out by the cacophony surrounding their battle. It is also interesting to see how Scotty joins the crew as he isn't on the ship when it leaves Starfleet.Bruce Greenwood plays Captain Pine, the original commander of the new U.S.S. Enterprise. He does a good job displaying the right mixture of knowledge, leadership and mentoring to his young crew. More importantly, this is Abrams way of giving a little wink and a nod to the fact the original television series pilot was filmed with Captain Pine, not Kirk. The network didn't like it and Gene Rodenberry recast the role making William Shatner Captain Kirk. This pilot episode would eventually become the basis for a later two-part episode reusing much of the footage in flashback. An interesting move on both Rodenberry and Abrams' part.Eric Bana plays Nero, once a simple miner trying to make a life for he and his expectant wife, who is now so hell-bent on revenge, he will destroy entire planets to achieve his goal. He is good, surprisingly, and displays both the right level of menace and humanity as displayed through his reasons for wanting to extract revenge. Bana was once the next big thing and starred in a series of films, none of which ever achieved much critical praise or box office clout. He is more interesting as the villain in this film than he was as the ""Hulk"" in the version directed by Ang Lee. He is following this film with a role in ""Funny People"", the new film from Judd Apatow starring Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen, Leslie Mann and Jonah Hill.And I don't think I'm spoiling anything for anyone by mentioning that Leonard Nimoy makes an appearance as Spock. It is sort of thrilling to see him return to such an iconic role. Better yet, rather than a quick cameo, his appearance plays an integral role in the plot and he has a significant amount of screen time.Perhaps best of all, none of the characters goes without creating at least one moment of levity. It is nice to see that while the material is taken very seriously, they also recognize we can have a bit of humor, to lighten up the serious nature of the story. Just a little.Abrams has created a plot involving black holes, time travel (allowing him to include Nimoy) and revenge. It is an involving, complicated story that makes good use of the characters, their mythology and their backgrounds. It's a great ride and an almost perfect film.I read an article about the making of this film and Abrams noted that when he was researching the material and watching the episodes of the television series, he noticed a lot of scenes had lens flares in front of the character's faces. This is yet another aspect Abrams chose to pay tribute to. And it is an interesting visual device the first dozen times or so. But when this continues throughout the entire film, sometimes more than once in a scene, it becomes distracting and annoying. In almost every scene, a bright light or a lens flare partially obscures at least one character's face for a few seconds before disappearing or lowering to return again. A few times, this is used as a transitional device, but more often than not, it simply becomes distracting.Despite this one annoying (and constant) distraction, Abrams and his writing team have done an amazing job of bringing life back to familiar characters and a familiar mythology that we don't have to give up just yet. I can't wait to see what they come up with for the two sequels. Can Khan be far away?"
I want to go to every island paradise featured in this video. I don't remember them all right now but each one was fantastic. More places to add to my bucket list.
excellent. What is not to like about our Navy SEALs.  Well done by all the actors and the writers. WOW
"district 13 had a lot of neat stunts, action packed martial arts scenes, weapons and exposive scenes. Awesome characters, a hot chinese woman, fighting for a better united society plot and a decent soundtrack! Recommended and thought it was better than what I expected it to be!"
"Don't know how my first review was lost, but I lauded this thing up one side and down the other!  Those who didn't like it ~ well to each their own, and there's no accounting for some people's tastes!"
"How could I best describe D13-U? Not quite easy, despite being an easy viewing. Action-packed, yes. Quite funny at times. An interesting plot dealing with deception and political machinations (one of the few movies with that theme that I could actually understand it pretty well). Pretty well-balanced, at least in my opinion. And, overall, worth checking out.There's not much I could say about it that wouldn't ruin plot points and all, yet I didn't see the first movie, though I did enjoy how this one went.So, the best I could do is a recommendation: if you like fast action, a great-paced movie, a foreign film, numerous twists and deep thought to the twists, and realistic fight scenes, and an eventual cast of eccentric people (including a woman who knows how to fight with her hair as a deadly whip) in the mix and a surprise twist at the end, this could definitely be for you."
"I would like to replace Amazon's ""anti-choice"" review by saying that both films are awesome.  Each had many awesome scenes of Parkour art sequences.  The second film built upon the first and added several new characters, new human dimensions to the franchise.  I understand a few languages and I had no trouble between the first and second films...  I enjoyed the dynamic for both movies and have been thrilled with the characters...  Looking forward to the next installment..."
This one is like the first one.  Lots of action with a short story thrown in for good measure.  Heroes and Bad guys in a world torn with poverty and strife.  Not so far fetched anymore.
"If you've ever had a moment as a teenager where you were sure your life was O-V-E-R (cue adolescent dramatics), hated your bestie because she had a bf and you didn't (yet) or felt like your parents were too ancient to understand anything about you and your life - this movie will make you laugh and cringe! A totally hilarious yet sensitive story about that time in your life where every day can be amazing or horrible!! :)"
"Wow, I'm going to have to change my mind about romantic comedies being predictable.  While this one does end in a predictable way, the story is anything but that.  I'm not one who cries at movies, but I actually teared up during the sappy moments!  All the actors are great in their respective roles, and the story is funny and moving at the same time.  I was going to avoid this movie because of the lame title, but I'm glad I didn't.  I haven't read the books, but I will now.  Very nicely done!!"
"It's curious George what's not to like....plus my kids looooove watching it.Just to let you know amazon, some reviews are just short :-( not happy about having to add more words"
Intelligence and wit.  Unique among the young children's pap that passes for entertainment. Kids love it and parents wont hate it.
"I personally can't feel to cozy with an animal that can rip your face off in real life...  However, the kiddo loves the trouble he gets into every episode.  (As someone who does not like chimps, I give it 2 stars  ;-) )"
"I initially got my 19 month old son into this show. Not soon after I realized it was quite entertaining for me to watch as well. Great morals, beautifully illustrated, and great writing."
Cute show.  We love the music and the monkey antics.  We enjoy watching it because both the nine month old grandson and the ten year old grandson laugh.
"We can't get enough of Curious George in our house. He's the sweetest, mischievous, cutest little monkey. Always ttys to fix his mistakes. Great show!"
"We've been reading the long time favorite monkey stories to our grandchildren, and now they all love to watch Curious George adventures on our kindle. We adults laugh right along with them, and the stories always make everyone feel calm and relaxed at bedtime, making for a restful evening for all."
"Because its curious george. Lol he has so much fun! He has the best adventures, they may start off a little upside down but he knows how to turn it around."
"It's curious George, what more is there to say. My little guy lives it. Would watch it over and over."
"Nobody gets smashed with a heavy object, no slaps, punches or kicks, just entertaining and educational cartoons that I enjoy almost as much as my three year old great grandson.  Curious George gets himself into some amazing predicaments but there is never a hint of violent behavior."
"Curious George has been a classic for years, however, I believe that the Curious George show is better than ever.  There is always a lesson hidden in these adorable episodes.  My son LOVES to watch it, and I am happy to let him watch.  They discuss topics from counting to instruments, colors, nature etc.  The graphics are wonderful and sharp, music is so cute!  I truly find myself singing the opening song with him&#8230;always! It is nice for our children to have shows that are fun, as well as educational."
"Well, he may be biased since he's a big fan of ""George"" but, my son loves this and we read him the book that we happened to have with the same title.  So....there you have it!  :)"
Love this show.  I watch it almost daily with my two and seven year old sons!  Good wholesome fun show for little ones!
"Curious George is a family-friendly show with great tools for any budding scientist, analyst, or news journalist. What do I mean?Each episode, for example, focuses on George going through a scientific-method-like process to figure out solutions to everyday problems. George's inquisitive nature helps him form hypotheses and experiment to test each hypothesis.George lives with a man with a yellow hat (that's his brand). His character's ok, but GEORGE steals the show. Kids will love the bright colors and uptempo pace of the show. The show has a narrator (who sounds a lot like the man in the yellow hat) who helps guide the viewer through George's actions and thoughts.You can't go wrong with this show."
"My whole family loves Curious George and watch it all the time. Surprisingly, even at my age I learn a bit from it. Great television for the family!"
this is my son's favorite show for whatever reason . . . .  the opening theme music always gets him extremely excited.
My baby loves this cartoon. Color are bright and vibrant. I don't like that after she watches it she then starts talking gibberish like George.
My kids love it.  Watch it almost everyday.  Good and funny.  Keeps them entertained.  Hope they get more season's on Prime.
"Best children's T.V. show out there! It provides great entertainment, and in each episode Curious George makes learning fun by teaching the child audience interesting things about our world. Highly recommend this show!"
"Curious George, I think it is a wonderfully done cartoon. The imagery and artwork is beautifully done. The pace is exciting without being too overstimulating and frazzling like many of the other kids shows on today. The color, the selection scheme is aesthetic, not gaudy and tacky as are some of others. The Yellow hat character and others are charming and the show is overall respectful and informative add on shows great respect and forgiveness for George. We love the reality segments as well. Curious George is just so darn cute and the show superbly done. The kids love it."
"This is a perfect cartoon, we love George and the story with the Man in the Yellow Hat. Great adaptation from the books"
"Better than sesame street. One of the best series from PBS. surprisingly education as george takes all sorts of field trips and explores all sorts of environments and settings and the writers use that to teach children about the world.It is very laid back and doesn't use cheesy songs or dances to entice kids. Instead it just focuses on cool adventures with george.As an adult I find it interesting and tolerable (barney or dora being rather nauseating to watch). My kids 3 and 6 find it engrossing and entertaining. they also learn a few cool things each time, especially if i'm watching it with them and pointing out things here and there to stimulate discussion.This is on par with Wild Kratts (which is an awesome series as well), but I'm almost tempted to say it teaches even more than wild kratts."
This plays daily on our fire tv and kindle!
Really fun show for kids. My daughter loves it and it's educational. Very safe for kids so you can let them watch it without worrying about anything inappropriate. I'm glad Amazon has this and other children's programming on Amazon Prime. One of the main reasons I use the service.
"My wife and I have recounted several times how the &#34;Curious George&#34; series has &#34;educated us&#34; on how things are made or simple physics, chemistry, math and science lessons.  I know that our children enjoy the entire series as well.  We have 7 kids, ranging from 11 years old all the way down to twins still in the womb.  We plan to continue (and possibly purchase) the Curious George series because of it's educational value, lessons, and good moral principles that are (for the most part) biblically based on the 10 commandments.  Many lessons like: Why its important to always tell the truth, honoring your parents, not harming others, the importance of listening...all great tools for good education as well as entertainment value.  Would recommend to anyone."
"The kids really like Curious George, I have to admit that I enjoy it too. If you are a parent and you need something for the kids to watch that will not get on your nerves..., this cartoon is it!Enjoy!"
Such a great show. Love George and his adventures. He always fixes his messes and helps out whenever he can.
"Curious George Seasons 2 is wonderful...just like all of the other seasons of Curious George.  As I have said in past reviews: the music is fun, the color and graphics are bold and pleasing for the kids!  My son loves it, and my older daughter always pulls up a chair when she hears the music!"
My granddaughter loves Curious George and loves watching all the seasons and episodes over and over again. I highly recommend this series for the toddler group.
My family is really into Curious George. It is entertaining for our 1 and 3 year old and me and my wife know them all by heart by now. There's interesting things for young and old in here...
"infant son's favorite tv show. He starts to dance when the theme music comes on.  It's not a learning show at all, just mindless entertainment."
"My son would watch it non-stop if allowed. He likes it and it isn't horrible, so i let him watch it."
"Our son loves Curious George, and its bearable for me to watch as well.  He's learned a lot from the different George episodes, making it easier for me to allow him to watch it."
"I wish all T.V. shows were this much fun! You learn as you have a good time, and it always gives you a good laugh, no matter what your age!"
We've watched these over and over again using Fire TV.  My 3 year old just loves this show and can't seem to get enough!
"I have to say with each season I'm more and more impressed by the wholesome fun that is Curious George.  This series has become a stable of one of my daughter's days and my wife and I enjoy watching it with her.  Primarily it is fun, engaging, and full of wholesome morality and lessons, such as: forgiveness, patience, understanding, loyalty, creativity, obedience and others.  I'm not espousing this show is the end all, be all...to teach your child, but they (and you) will have a lot of fun together watching and explaining as you go.  :-)"
"I was never into curious george s a kid but as an adult and a mother of three i hae absolutelly fallen in love with this monkey.  George is alway's entertaining and of coarse curious.  I appriciate this show because it teaches my little one some very important lessons like standards in measurements and sociaization kills, you cant go wrong with this show."
"Very lively and fun for the whole family. I don't mean to sound like an advertisement, but it really does bring on the smiles and giggles."
"As a parent and grandparent of 71 years young, I have seen the excitement and rapture in my children who have had the opportunity to both read the stories of curious George as well as this latest series of videos.  The video is very enrapturing to both adults and children.  Curious George continues to provide hours of entertainment for my 2 year old grandchild.  The added ability to stop and question and interact with your child to discuss what is happening to Curious George in his never ending ability to get into trouble because of his curiousity, is a common theme throughout.It provides a simple way to teach the consequences of not  understanding what might happen if one does not temper curiousity with caution :-)."
"Curious George is a fun, educational and wonderful show.  The colors and graphics are bright and fun.  I love how the show always teachers the kids about something.  This show hits on subjects such as science and math in a fantastic combination of fun stories and learning.  I loved Curious George as a child, and I love it even more while watching with my children"
"Such a good show. My daughter loves it, there is enough sillyness to it that adults should enjoy it too"
My kids love curious George.  He teaches as he entertains.  Good for any age group.  I have a 2 and a 7 year old and they both love him.
fun and cute. my two yr old loves it. it teaches them about consequences to actions in a very positive light.
"This is such a cute cartoon from PBS. We love the story and George, the cartoon isn't as &#34;strobe-y&#34; as others, so find it's a nice change from the other cartoons in the market."
This is a very smart adultoon ( adult cartoon).  Love the innuendo both subtle and blatant.  Worth checking it out
"This show is absolutely hilarious! I can't begin to say how entertaining Archer is to the uninitiated. If you're unfamiliar with the show, it's an animiated comedy about a dysfunctional spy agency in NYC with the mother of the main character running it, with some excellent background characters as well. Every episode is great in its own way and are just as fun upon multiple viewings. There's even some decent continuity between the episodes here and in later seasons. Often times the first season of new shows are good enough to keep you watching but really starts to shine as it progresses, but Archer has been great on many levels since the first ep and is just as good or better than more recent ones. If you're a fan of animated comedy or spy-satire get this and you won't be disappointed."
"Like many people, I suspect, I would see a show called ""Archer"" in the TV guide grid of my satellite subscription. Not knowing what it was, except for the terse episode descriptions (""Archer must seduce an enemy agent""), I often continued channel surfing. IF ONLY I'D KNOWN! I would have been watching Archer from the start. WATCH IT and make up your own mind.Archer is incredibly well written, extremely humorous, and creates stereotypes for the purposes of both homage to old genre/cult TV/movies, and also in order to satirize those aspects of them that are hopelessly out of date. There's also some sly humor about show biz.Archer, both the character and the show, is highly politically incorrect on a constant and ongoing basis. (This is NOT a show for easily offended people.) Yet the political incorrectness doesn't feel gratuitous and joyless like it is on Family Guy and American Dad (which I like, but... are much, much more ""in your face""). Archer's political incorrectness feels authentic to the major characters, most of whom (especially Archer) are intriguing, anachronistic constructs of spy and action stereotypes -- especially Archer and Malory.Everyone drinks, often excessively -- no one more than Archer. There's drug use, tons of violence as they complete their missions, and usually sex and/or discussion of sex, some of which is kinky or bizarre. There is a lot of swearing (some bleeped out). If a character iss on a major rant, you see their lips moving, but all you hear is ""bleeeeeeeeeeep!"" -- so you know they're on a tear. It's actually funnier (to me) than it would be to hear them swearing!It was hard to watch this show live: I laughed so often and so hard, that I missed the next lines of dialogue (yay, DVRs and instant rewind of live TV). And the next lines are often snappy comebacks from gorgeous, biracial ex-lover and rival top ISIS spy, Lana. They are also frequently from Malory, Cyril or Pam.Archer *knows* when he's being politically incorrect -- he does it on purpose. But he also calls it like he sees it, like most of the other characters on the show. On other shows, that could be annoying, insulting, even preachy. Yet on Archer, it's hilarious. The show has a sense of humor about itself. In a way, Lana and the other characters are the Penny and Brain to Archer's Inspector Gadget -- but Archer's not a cyborg and isn't clueless and inept like Inspector Gadget. (Not to mention tons handsomer, like an animated Don Draper/John Hamm of Mad Men.) Archer is actually a highly skilled and capable spy -- a Casanova, action hero, man-child with the coolest toys and gadgets whose attitude often gets in the way, and whose escapades often result in gadgets failing or being rendered useless. Lana's got his back, but she never lets him forget it, either.Despite -- or maybe because of? -- being conscious of their political incorrectness, both Archer and the show usually have their hearts in the right place... There's more pathos than you would expect, but not for long. Archer never misses a self-serving opportunity, and never, ever misses the opportunity to take a shot at someone. Literally and figuratively, if it's wide open, Archer will take the shot -- he's incorrigible that way, like a perennial teenage boy.Archer has very distinct metrosexual qualities and -- unlike old, macho stereotypical genre heroes -- a blithely savoir faire attitude towards homosexuality. (Predating by three years the much-ballyhooed rebooted Craig Bond's ""What makes you think this is my first time?"" reply to villain Raoul's thigh-stroking, gay come-on, might I point out.) He's never homophobic, but he also manages to frequently make it the butt of jokes (no pun intended!). He's also extremely attractive, completely self-absorbed, a hopeless skirt-chaser, and a love 'em and leave 'em kind of guy. What else could he be, as a world-class, globe-trotting spy?Beneath his suave and cocky shell, Archer is a bundle of neuroses and somewhat arrested development. But he's open about it, with a number of coping skills that allow him to plow on through his implausible life without changing. He so often points the finger of blame for his emotional limitations at his single mother and boss/ISIS agency president Malory, that it becomes one of the tropes of the show. His manservant Woodhouse (who basically raised him while Malory was a world-class, globe-trotting female spy) is perhaps the most rational character, with dry observations and a sadly funny resignation about the way Archer uses and abuses him, completely taking him for granted (rather like a child takes a parent for granted).All in all, Season 1 introduces these hilarious characters and their bizarre ""near future"" present, which encompasses all of the spy, weapons, and electronics technology of the past 100 years (all of which Archer, Lana and other staff and enemies/villians inexplicably and magically know how to use). There is enough backstory for the main characters to make it interesting, but significant gaps are left to keep you guessing.The main concerns are the relations between the characters, their roles in ISIS' present day espionage missions, ongoing action including guns/weapons/hand-to-hand combat/occasional explosions and fire, getting drunk and/or getting laid, feisty rivalry between characters, the working relationships of ISIS' administrative staff, and the occasional foregrounding of the meta. Come to think of it, besides being an animated action/spy comedy, there are occasional aspects of Archer that could also qualify as workplace humor. But the vast majority of it is loving yet satirical homage to the implausible adventures of world-class spies and the agencies and support staff from whence they come.If you like adult comedy animated series (especially in the action or scifi genre) with rapid-fire, witty dialogue, and subtle rather than in-your-face humor layered in with the situation comedy, you should love Archer. If you've watched any scifi, spy, action, or supernatural live action or animated TV series in the last fifty years, there is something for you to like here. There are sometimes quite esoteric references.Just watch it. You'll probably love it. I did, and I like it more with every episode (we're on season four now)."
"this whole show is just about too funnylove that the lines, given any other way might not be as funnybut this is sly and well done"
I don't watch this series but my son purchased this so he could pass time on the airplane.  This was a win-win for both of us.  He kept from getting bored and I got to finish some work while he watched the video.
It is one of the best mature audience animations out there.  The back and forth between characters is great.  Archer takes it another level always trying to get over and one liners are hilarious.
"The sexually and violent-y squeamish may have issues with this series, but that aside, the work is sheer genius. Archer is a lazy, stupid, boorish but (almost) always successful agent for ISIS, a security/spy agency run by his even more outlandish mother. A host of quirky characters with kinks that defy even advanced geometry, excellent art and animation, and scripts whose throwaway lines are better than most contemporary fiction are just some of the selling points. If you like cultural references a la MST3K, have a secret love for the Matt Helm lifestyle and just appreciate satire, you will love this."
"OVERVIEW:  The comedy series ""Archer,"" created by Adam Reed, was first announced on FX in the fall of 2009.  Reed credits the inspiration for the show to a personal experience in which he was unable to muster up the charisma to hit on a beautiful woman; he later fantasized about a suave, debonair spy who would always have the right moves.  I have absolutely fallen in love with ""Archer;"" I can't get enough of the continuous wit and exceptionally clever dialog.  Unlike other animated shows, ""Archer"" utilizes complex plotting as well as character development, allowing viewers to watch and rewatch episodes without sacrificing entertainment value.  I am personally humbled by the various cultural references employed by the writers--it just goes to show how involved intellect must be in creating comedy.  I fully understand that much of the show's content may be deemed offensive to some viewers, so to enjoy it, it's best to keep in mind that ""Archer"" is written in a satirical manner.  It is fair to warn, however, that the series earns its TV/MA rating quite well through use of crude language, violence, and sexual situations; basically, it's probably not suitable for children or anyone who isn't a fan of that sort of comedy.The storyline centers around Sterling Archer (H. Jon Benjamin) who is the sort of spy Reed had imagined, only with a few extra character `flaws'--he is pretty much a sociopath.  Despite bearing the codename Duchess, Archer is considered the world's most dangerous spy; were he not absorbed with promiscuity, alcoholism, expensive toys and tactlenecks, he might also be considered the world's best spy.  Archer works for his self-centered and emotionally distant mother, Malory Archer (Jessica Walter), at the International Secret Intelligence Service (ISIS) based in New York City.  Fellow ISIS employees include agent Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler), comptroller Cyril Figgis (Chris Parnell), agent Ray Gillette (Adam Reed), HR Director Pam Poovey (Amber Nash), Head of Applied Research Dr. Algernop Krieger (Lucky Yates), ISIS whipping-boy Brett Buckley (Neal Holman), and nut-job secretary Cheryl Tunt (Judy Greer).  Other recurring cast-members include:  ODIN agent Barry Dylan (Dave Willis) and Archer's valet, Woodhouse (George Coe; Roy McCrery in flashbacks).Season 1 Guest Stars:  mole agent Crenshaw aka Kremenski (Shelly Desai), Cuban agent Charles (Thomas Lennon), Cuban agent Rudy (R. Ben Garant), UN Intelligence Committee Chairman Torvald Utne (Jeffrey Tambor), head of ODIN Len Trexler (Jeffrey Tambor), freelance assassin Elke Hubsch aka ""The Needle"" (Audrey Wasilewski), former Cuban spy Ramon Limon (Ron Perlman), German freelance assassin Mannfred (Ren&eacute; Auberjonois), German freelance assassin Uta (Kat Cressida), and double agent Conway Stern (Coby Bell).ARCHER:  THE COMPLETE SEASON ONE--premiered on January 14, 2010 with the episode ""Training Day.""  The first season focuses on introducing the main characters and their manners of interaction.  The various plots also set in motion a few themes that carry into later seasons; just a few examples:  Who is Archer's father?  Will Lana and Archer get back together?  What will come of the rivalry between Barry and Archer?  Why does Woodhouse take such abuse?SPECIAL FEATURES:  [10 Episodes/2 Discs]  The Original Unaired ""Archer"" Pilot*, Deleted Scenes, Unaired Network Promo, The ""League"" Pilot Episode, ""Louie"" Pilot Episode, and The Making of ""Archer"":  3D Animation, Art Direction, Backgrounds, and Storyboards.EPISODES:Episode 1*:  ""Mole Hunt""--(unaired pilot)  The season opens on a simulation exercise where Sterling Archer is being interrogated by fellow agent Crenshaw.  We learn Archer's codename, Duchess, is actually an homage to Malory's beloved and deceased Afghan Hound.  When Archer is pressed to settle his ISIS expense account, he fabricates a mole hunt in hopes that fear-mongering will convince Pam to grant him mainframe access.  Once he realizes none of his coworkers are going to help him get into the mainframe, Archer employs his super-spy techniques to break in.  During his after-hours ISIS infiltration, Archer accidentally discovers a real mole, Crenshaw/Kremenski, misappropriating funds for his escape back to Russia.  Now that the fabricated mole, coincidentally, turns out to be real, Archer must use his powers of `classic misdirection' to save ISIS (and settle his expense account).Episode 2:  ""Training Day""--A drunken Sterling accidentally foils the plans of an IRA suicide bomber, thus saving the `bacon' of an English diplomat (who Archer refers to as Santa Claus).  Lana, to the dismay of Cyril and Malory, appears a little gaga over Archer's knack for heroism.  In order to keep Lana's attention on Cyril, Malory intervenes and orders Archer to train Cyril as an agent; Archer takes it upon himself to prepare Cyril for failure, prostitutes, and other smut.Episode 3:  ""Diversity Hire""--Due to some recent `vacancies,' ISIS is low on minority agents.  Malory hires Conway Stern, a `double whammy,' to fill the diversity quota as is mandatory for tax deduction status.  Lana, for fear that her continuing tenure as top agent may be threatened, questions Conway's legitimacy as an ISIS agent; Archer focuses on intercepting the possibility that his mother and Conway might engage in a sexual relationship.Episode 4:  ""Killing Utne""--In order to swindle a lucrative contract, Malory plans a dinner party to seduce Torvald Utne, the chairman of the UN Intelligence Committee.  Even though Sterling is forbidden to bring a date, he runs into Elke Hubsch on the street.  Elke, aka ""The Needle,"" gives Archer the impression that she is `for hire,' but she is actually an undercover assassin tasked with killing Utne.  Meanwhile, Malory has hired Mannfred and Uta (German freelance assassins) to pose as wait-staff; she actually arranges for the fair to pretend to assassinate Utne so that her ISIS agents can foil the plot and save Utne's life, and thereby secure the UN contract.Episode 5:  ""Honeypot""--Ramon Limon, a Cuban spy, obtains a sex tape that stars Nikolai Jakov, head of the KGB, and Malory Archer, head of ISIS.  If the video is leaked, Malory can be charged with treason, which is possibly a ploy by Nikolai to force Malory to defect to Russia.  In order to retrieve the video, Malory gives Ramon her South Beach condo.  Archer is then dispatched to carry out the `honeypot,' which involves Archer attempting to seduce Ramon.  In the meantime, Woodhouse regales undercover Cuban agents, Charles and Rudy, with romantic war stories from his past.Episode 6:  ""Skorpio""--Lana takes a job recovering stolen missiles from notorious arms dealer Skorpio; the bounty will allow her to remodel her kitchen and the cruise of the French Riviera, aboard Skorpio's super-yacht, will given her a much-needed vacation from clingy boyfriend, Cyril.  Malory tags along for a `conference' that is actually her own romantic cruise aboard a boat with Nikolai Jakov.  Back at ISIS, the crew torments Cyril with thoughts of what Lana is ACTUALLY doing.  When Lana's mission goes south, Archer is dispatched to rescue her.Episode 7:  ""Skytanic""--The new rigid airship, Excelsior, receives a bomb threat which targets its maiden voyage.  ISIS is contacted to place agents Lana Kane and Sterling Archer aboard in hopes that they can thwart the terror plot.  Malory, jealous that her neighbor Trudy Beakman will on board for Excelsior's premier voyage, uses her connections to con a VIP cabin, thus bumping Trudy from the trip's roster.  Fearing what may come of Lana and Archer sharing a cabin, Cyril sneaks onboard along with Pam and Cheryl; Cheryl continues to blackmail Cyril into sleeping with her.Episode 8:  ""The Rock""--In hopes of gaining a security contract, Lana and Archer infiltrate San Mariano's palace, exposing any flaws in the security system.  Despite their work, the long-term contract is awarded to rival agency ODIN, headed by Len Trexler.  Cyril reveals to Pam and Cheryl that he has bought a ring and plans to propose to Lana; he is humiliated when the girls laugh at the tiny ring, spurring all ISIS employees to reflect on their meager salaries.  The `drones' form a union and go on strike; Lana, Archer, and Malory are considered `management' because of their more significant incomes.  Because of the strike, Lana and Archer must attempt a mission designed to reap revenge on ODIN and San Mariano without the aid of agency intell and satellite support.Episode 9:  ""Job Offer""--Lana becomes frustrated when Archer fumbles during the pursuit of Kasparov.  After ODIN swoops in and takes credit for the capture, Barry Dylan (Archer's nemesis) offers Lana a position at ODIN.  Cyril fears Lana may leave him for Barry, so he follows her to Paris for the interview.  When Malory fires Sterling, he seeks employment with ODIN as well; Malory retaliates against her son by blacklisting him.  Archer further antagonizes Barry by sleeping with his fianc&eacute;, Franois, in his new office.  Once ODIN receives the burn notice on Archer, Barry happily accepts the opportunity to assassinate him; Lana has to choose between Archer and her new job.Episode 10:  ""Dial M for Mother""--Now that Cyril's secret has been exposed, ISIS puts a ban on interoffice relationships.  Lana seeks revenge on the cheating Cyril by sleeping with everyone in the office.  Malory's secret about Sterling's paternity comes into question as well, and the top candidates seem to be Nikolai Jakov of the KGB, Len Trexler of ODIN, and Buddy Rich.  Upset that he may not be Archer's father after all, Nikolai arranges for Mannfred and Uta to capture Sterling and implant a mind-control chip in his brain; Nikolai intends to use the chip to force Archer into killing his mother."
The Doctor is pure nonsense and I really enjoyed it. Rose is a great addition to the show.She is great.
"I bought this along with Season Two for my son who was really really happy with them . He already owns Season 3 and is waiting for Season 4 to come out. Where he lives he only gets two TV channels. If it weren't for DVDs and Netflix, he would have nothing to watch."
"In an effort to capitalize on the audience from ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,"" the FX network has tried a number of promising shows. ""Sunny,"" to me, has always been a completely inspired bit of lunacy that defies everything about the age of political correctness in which we find ourselves. It is so wrong--but that's what makes it so right. Unapologetically demented and offensive, the show has moments of brilliance. ""Archer,"" of all the programs that have followed the ""Sunny"" time slot comes the closest to the ribald and irreverent tone and works exceedingly well as a companion piece.""Archer"" is a terrifically entertaining animated piece featuring perhaps the most obnoxious and oblivious central characters you're likely to encounter. Sterling Archer (aka Duchess) is a spy who fulfills every sexist cliche one might expect from a boozy, clueless, womanizing James Bond wannabe! In other words, he is awesome! Voiced impeccably by H. Jon Benjamin, it is sheer madness to follow Archer as he blunders his way through assignments, familial entanglements, and romantic assignations. His flirtations with fellow spy Lana (Aisha Tyler), his rivalry with Lana's new beau Cyril (Chris Parnell), his workplace banter with easy Cheryl and inappropriate Pam (Judy Greer and Amber Nash), and his wonderfully dysfunctional mother love (the incredible Jessica Walter) are juggled nicely amidst a bevy of ""Get Smart"" missions. It's all great, but patently disturbing, fun.Season One represents 10 episodes. Two standouts to me are ""Mole Hunt""--the first episode, and perhaps the funniest, that strikes the perfect balance of wackiness and character introduction--and ""Honeypot"" where Archer must put his life and his body on the line as an irresistible gay boy toy. By all means, check this series out if you like comedy that straddles the line of good taste and then jumps over it! I loved this creation named Archer and his relationship with his mother is one of this great show's true highlights. Benjamin and Walter are a perfect pair! About 4 1/2 stars. KGHarris, 11/10."
It's not porno but it does have adult themes. I found it funny and entertaining. I did buy this blind having not seen the show on FX. The reviews were great and the theme sounded different. I was not disappointed and soon bought 2 more seasons..
I love this show. They did so well on the animation and h Jon Benjamin is amazing and hilarious. Awesome!
"This is a fun over the top spy animation tale that has no problem which is surprisingly funnier than most main film comedies and has enough sexual acts and jokes in it to make the prudes blush big time. The supporting cast characters are surprisingly good and sometimes steal the scenes. Notable voice actors include: H. Jon Benjamin, Jessica Walter, Aisha Tyler, Chris Parnell, (Ren&eacute; Auberjonois, and Judy Greer. Ron Perlman and Burt Reynolds make short appearances. Most of the show is animated it Atlanta, Georgia. In 2010, H. Jon Benjamin was nominated for a Primetime Emmy for outstanding voiceover performance. On July 17, 2010, Archer won the NewNowNext award for ""Best Show You're Not Watching"". It was also nominated for Best Comedy Series at the 2011 Critics Television Awards. It was nominated for Best Animated Comedy Series at the 2012 Comedy Awards.CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; HUMOR: B plus to A minus; ANIMATION/ANGLES: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: February to March 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus."
"Archer: The Complete Season One. This is a great series, and well worth the money to own them. It is kind of race but funny."
Archer is an adult cartoon show. Archer is a Secret Agent and works for his Mother along with a gang of misfits. I could do without some of the language but otherwise it is a great show.
"This was crude but funny and downright hilarious. One of the wittiest, funniest, bawdiest comedies. The voice actors hit their mark, the writing is creative. Certainly for any kids under age 18. My hubby and I only watch it after the kids are off to bed."
"Adult humor, very funny. You probably don't want to watch it around young adults until you watch an episode or two and decide if it's ok for them or not."
What a great adult themed cartoon.  It is along the lines of Family Guy only with more adult content.  I laugh so hard every time I watch this.
"You know, I don't normally put my review titles in all caps. But what can I say? This show is... well, BRILLIANT! I've always thought that there are far, far too many five star reviews here on amazon. But if there ever was a show that genuinely deserved a rave, this is it.Archer is a wonderfully absurdist frolic for strictly adult audiences. Fundamentally this show is a giant spoof of 1960s spy thrillers; a spoof made for decidedly 21st century sensibilities. It's the show Get Smart would have been had all the characters been perpetually high on crystal meth.In fact, the characters on Archer are all selfish, petty, and utterly and completely venal: the three great ingredients from which comedy is made. They seem to think and act more like deranged adolescents than grown-ups. Deranged adolescents with access to firearms. Add all this together and you get some idea of the flavor of the show. Archer is very much in the spirit of the original Williams Street adult swim cartoons, but is never merely derivative of them. Which of course is exactly what you'd expect, given that this show is produced by Adam Reed, whose previous producing and directing credits include both Sealab 2021 and Frisky Dingo. Indeed, Reed's voice credits go all the way back to the original Space Ghost Coast to Coast.But while a similar sense of humor can be found throughout, Archer definitely has a flair all of its own. Visually it has kind of a pseudo-realist ""ligne claire"" (clear line) style that matches perfectly with the creatively anachronistic world the characters inhabit. Cell phones and other contemporary technologies may abound, but jet-age fashions still prevail, and the KGB and the Soviet Union remain major adversaries.But the first thing long time hard core animation fans will notice is that voice of H. Jon Benjamin brings its own uniquely laconic comic genius to the title role of ""Archer"" himself. Many of us remember Benjamin best as Coach from Home Movies. Others may recognize his voice from various bit parts in Family Guy and the Venture Bros.. But wherever you know him from, I for one am overjoyed that a suitable vehicle has finally been found for this great talent.Better yet, Benjamin is complemented by scarcely lesser talents such as Aisha Tyler, a standup comedian who plays Lana Kane, another top operative at the same spy agency; and Jessica Walter, who plays the head of the agency - who also just happens to be Archer's mother. However, I should stress that this rather unusual combination of relationships is never reduced to mere sit-com hijinx. Archer is the kind of show were things get genuinely disturbing. In fact, this is one of those rare shows where the entire cast is incredibly strong - and backed up by an equally strong writing team, too.What more can I say? See it!Theo."
"Sorry, just saw the latest season 4 episode. You know, cobras and taints? Well my last review got bumped for a language interpretation - I assume - because I used the phrase 'Holy s*** snacks'. This is just a test to see if I get bumped again.Anyhow, outrageous, totally non-PC humor, slime-ball secret agent-ery, suave nimrod-ery, ribald water-cooler humor - I'm in heaven .... funny as a WHOLE BIG OL' box of sh8t-snacks ....  :)"
"Very funny, excellent acting, great characters combined with a whole lot of sex jokes and spy-themed violence.  Sterling Archer is the best cartoon character ever -- and he'd probably tell you so himself.  Give it 22 minutes and you'll not regret it."
"Archer (2009) is an animated series about the radical activities of agents in a top secret intelligence agency.  It deals with very mature subject matter, in a wicked, irreverent, crude, and snappy manner that can be quite shocking and hilarious, though there is no doubt that the program will offend many.  Laced with profanity, nudity, all manner of lewd sexual and homosexual references, racial charged jabs, as well as characters engaged in sexual acts, Archer blatantly intends to be in your face provocative, and offers no apologies for it.  With almost every character warped, demented, and self-absorbed, the world of Archer is one seriously messed up place, featuring favors of the 60's spy craze, and cold war sensibilities.  Espionage and secret agents exploded into the popular culture in the 1960's, largely due to the massive popularity of the James Bond films.  The spy craze inspired spoofs, but none of them are even close to the level of insanity that is found in Archer.  Created by Adam Reed (Sealab 2021), Season One contains ten half hour episodes, that were originally broadcast on FX.Sterling Archer (voiced by H. Jon Benjamin) in an agent for ISIS (International Secret Intelligence Service), a security agency engaged in nebulous surreptitious activities.  He's an arrogant fellow, interested in womanizing, drinking, personal grooming, turtlenecks, and only occasionally completing his assigned mission.  Archer has some skills, but often succeeds by accident.  He has issues at work, because his mother Malory Archer (voiced by Jessica Walter), is the head of ISIS, and they don't have the greatest relationship.  She is extremely demanding, and something of a bitch.Interoffice sexcapades are routine at ISIS.  Archer's romantic relationship with fellow agent Lana Kane (voiced by Aisha Tyler) has ended.  Their current working relationship is often full of friction, though professional when their lives are at stake.  Lana has a huge libido, and is currently involved with Cyril Figis (voiced by Chris Parnell), the agency's well endowed comptroller.  Rounding out the office personnel are Pam (voiced by Amber Nash), the chubby human resources director who likes to blab intimate secrets, and Cheryl (voiced by Judy Geer) who is Malory Archer's secretary.  Similar to The Man From U.N.C.L.E., entry to the secret ISIS headquarters is through a laundry that acts as a cover for the clandestine operation.The first episode ""Mole Hunt"" sets the tone for the series, as in order to try and cover up his phony expense account charges, Archer invents the story that there is mole inside ISIS, to try and get access to the company mainframe.  He ends up breaking into headquarters, uncovering a real mole, and getting an erection when his mother is held hostage.While matters are quite sordid inside ISIS headquarters, things are often even more outrageous out in the field.  In the episode ""Honeypot"", Sterling sent to Miami where he poses as a gay boy toy, in order to try and seduce a gay Cuban foreign agent, in order to recover a sex tape of Malory Archer and Nikolai Jackov the head of the KGB.  Archer blabs his secret mission to two gay males he happens to meet.  The hair stylist and interior designer, provide Archer with advice on how to seduce the Cuban.  The mission finishes with treachery, and a massively destructive shootout.In the season finale ""Dial M For Mother"", Malory Archer reveals that she mislead her son about who his father was.  His real father is either Len Drexler the head ODIN, a rival security agency, KGB head Nikolai Jackov, or drummer Buddy Rich (a real person, now deceased).  After discovering that Cyril cheated on her, Lana retaliates by offering to have sex with all takers (37) in the office.  Meanwhile Jackov abducts Archer, and has a chip implanted in his brain, which causes him to attack his mother with a cleaver.  Season one ends, with some warm blood-soaked family time.Taking shots at so many targets, Archer intends to entertain in part by being outrageous and shocking.  Whether it goes too far is a matter of personal taste, as the program is bound to offend most people at some point.  Still, below that threshold there can be a lot of nasty and sleazy entertainment value.  It is a spoof, so taking it too seriously is not recommended.The animation is extremely stylish and very well done, reminiscent in some ways of classic 1960's style cartoons like Jonny Quest, although the content is of course radically different.  Regardless of the subject matter, the look and visual style makes for very entertaining viewing, where things like shootouts, explosions, and action scenes, have a unique cool look.  The voice talent is first class as well, led by H. Jon Benjamin, Jessica Walter, and Aisha Tyler.  Hopefully the DVD set will contain some bonus materials that delves into the motivations of the creative team behind Archer.  New Season Two episodes are scheduled to begin airing on FX in January 2011."
"I don't know where to start explaining this.  In a nutshell, Archer is the exact opposite of James Bond and the entire series hilariously moves on from there. Watch it!"
"I honestly never heard of this show but took the chance to watch it.  Sure glad that I did.  The humor is absolutely crude but it is also very funny.  If you are easily offended, don't watch. But if not, you will have a blast."
"This series is about missing people.  It is not about solved missing persons cases.  It is typically about people who are still missing.  There are so many missing people--people who just vanish and are never seen again--missing without explanation or reason at all.  I'm glad this series calls attention to their cases.  Having searched for two missing persons myself (Elizabeth Smart and Lori Soares), I understand the frustration of the search.  Fortunately there was resolution in both cases I searched for, but there are so many other cases which are not ever solved.  Shows like this keep them in the limelight."
I love watching this show it is very interesting and I learn something about keeping safe. I love shows like this
"I'm a sucker for stories like those featured in Disappeared, so I start out being their target audience -- and ID didn't disappoint. The episodes are well-done with high production values. Recommended for those who think real life can be better than fiction."
This true based show lets the consumer aware of &#34;what could happen&#34; to you or loved ones. We are notmedia informed about how large this problem is. Avid watcher!
"But it was interesting.  But I don't think I would buy this product, but then again, I might if it was PRIME free"
I liked this. The fish come right out at times and the color was amazing. my only complaint is that it was really short. I could have watched it for a few more hours! :)
"I have just started using my 3D and purchased this and an outer space IMAX 3D movie and I'm totally blown away.  The only other 3D movie I have to compare with is Avatar.  Not sure if it's the IMAX or what, but these 2 movies put Avatar to shame for 3D."
"This 3d feature looks stunning on blu ray 3d. It was of course a 45 minute 3max show that is a nature program. The one star ratings on this are by people who don't understand what underwater 3d is about. IN fact 3d is often used just for depth and not for things coming out at you.  GET OVER THIS IDEA.  Jim carrey makes a whimsical narrator on this one and he's clearly enjoying his job!. The show like all modern nature shows gives a glimpse of the vanishing ocean vistas that man is destroying.  If you don't like short nature programs then don't buy imax blu ray shows. If you do this is a good underwater one. THere was only one scene where my 3d went double vision on me, some releases do that much more. So all and all this is a good one for nature lovers who want some depth to the picture."
"All episodes wonderful..watched all the seasons,each one exciting and new,wish it was still on today..2013...BBC.makes great films,love them.as a American,who has travelled  extensively in England I,loved seeing England during W.W.2'"
"Very enjoyable program.  It keeps your attention, and I had the best time trying to figure out &#34;who done it.&#34;  I particularly enjoyed the language as we here in the USA speak a different English then the British. The WWII background also was of interest, as it brought to life all the hardships that the war imposed on the people of Britain and the prejudices that were created because of this war."
I've enjoyed each and every episode.  Extremely well crafted and acted.  We need more quality programming like this; this sets the bar high.
I have now watched every episode in this long running series and wish it had gone on even longer. Brilliantly done and an engrossing look at WWII and many behind the scenes scenarios I was unaware of. The acting is stellar.
"Most especially during war time. However, the situation at home is aggravated. This BBC series, written by A. Horowitz, is a compelling fictional account of Detective Chief Inspector Foyle's investigations of domestic (his region) crimes during WWII. Highly recommended for you PBS crime/mystery/war drama fans."
"Michael Kitchen is Foyle, a soft-spoken but very perceptive detective in an English village during WWII.  He and his sidekick, along with his driver (the very comely Honeysuckle Weeks), solve murders and take down the pretenders in society.  Watch carefully, note the clues, and you may be able to work it out yourself.  Addictive, can't wait for the next series."
"The stories and the acting is great, the equipment, cars, uniforms telephone etc. are true to the period, great mystery."
"Same rating I gave in series 2, love his officer and driver...I try to figure who did it..most of the time I'm wrong."
Part of fun of this show is the realism. The scenery; the old vehicles; the buildings;  the rural areas and even the police station although they closed the old station. The cast is great and actually look like real people. The mysteries are fun to watch although the guilty party(s) is/are usually not one of the main suspects. All-in-all this whole series is a great.
The stories are always engaging and the era ( WWII) interests me..Foyles driver brings unique point of view to the story line.
I love this season.  It has seven in all. watching it very entertaining. Good great wonderful amazingDr George Tomes
"Well written, compelling acting...this one I am really enjoying, and trying to draw out the viewings so I prolong the pleasantness."
An excellent enthralling series made so by an ensemble that just makes it happen in what seems such an easier manner.  They bring us back to a sullen time and make us part of this history all over again in such an entertaining way without the rose colored plots that could sink a series of this nature quickly.
I lot this show but then I love a great many of the British series both the comedies as well as the mysteries.  Keep them coming.
Each episode of this series is well done and interesting. I am hooked on this series and am dreading it ending. The actors are superb. The casting could not have been better. Foyle is an intelligent and thoughtful person who gets to the truth by being observant of the little things surrounding each case. He also has a soft heart and a determination to do the right thing.
I love the setting; both in time and placement. The costuming is wonderful and the subject matter always appears believable.
I like the especially accurate scene that is portrayed in the films and the plots are excellent. The actors are also very good.
This is an excellent series capturing the feel of privation and the constant threat of invasion over several early war years.  The acting is outstanding.
I love this series and do not want it to end!  I sort of use it as a reward for finishing my goal for the day!
My wife and I thoroughly enjoy this series. The best of all is that you can watch it on Amazon Prime for free. It is full of history too.
"This is Great Britain in the Second World War. Foyle is a Detective Chief Superintendent in Hastings on the southern coast. His experiences with the war, spies, espionage and of course, murder is a unique look into society. This is a clever detective whose son flies with the RAF and his driver, Sam. A great series of adventures beautifully portrayed. I enjoyed this series enormously."
"The whole series of Foyles war is outstanding. Christopher Foyle is low key, but always gets the mystery solved  You want to see moe."
"This program gives another look at the behavior of people during the war with Germany and how local law enforcement were able to squash many terrorist activities and local violence as well.  It is interesting and well written, gives the viewer England's beautiful towns and country side and gives a bit of insight into the thoughts of the people of the time."
"Wonderful story line from Masterpiece Theater, there's always 2 or 3 situations going on throughout all episodes. The scenery is as Hastings was and what look like original aircraft being used from WW2 very authentic  with all the old cars etc. Wonderful characters played by good sound english actors. Great watching"
"very enlightening to think about a small town still having local issues during the events of WWII,  The problems and how things get dealt with shine a light on the moral character of that period.  The characters are well developed and easily seen as real people.Highly recommend to anyone interested in history, and/or theater."
"As most fans of British t.v. dramas know, we don't even make series such as this in the U.S.  This is for adults, with great character development and unfolding plots, not boxed into a 1/2 hour.  And no vampires."
"I watched all the series of Foyle's War, and they were some of the best TV shows I have seen.  I don't usually like war themedentertainment, but this is the exception.  I thought Michael Kitchen was just the coolest inspector ever."
"Mr. Kitchen is a master player.  A supporting cast of characters, exceptional writing, background and locale fit the WWII scene to perfection. One wonders way American story tellers can't follow suite.  Full series keeps your attention. Recommended w/o reservation."
"The first time I saw Michael Kitchen was in a movie named Enchanted April. I was hooked on him. I wanted more movies, or TV or whatever was avaliable for him. He has a presence in the scenes he's in. He's layed back  easy to watch. The roles he plays seem to be in movies that are fairly clean. He doesn't have to say much, his facial expressions tell it all. I've throughly enjoyed all the Foyle's War episodes. The plots are good and the actors are exceptional. The plots have a British slant and it's interesting to see the war from that point of view."
"The Brits know how to do it with dignity and professionalism.  This series is an instant classic, and Foyle handles the tough calls of his job with fairness and compassion.  It has proved to be a series worth seeing again and again."
Foyle's War has excellent actors and story lines. It's a &#34;do not miss&#34; in our home. Watch it sooner rather than later.
I have enjoyed this show very much I also enjoy show's that are of  WWII time. And I find it interesting hearing some of there their views of Americans being there.
I love this series.  Series 3 reveals more about what went on in England during World War II.  Great acting by the cast!
Love Michael Kitchen and Honeysuckle Weeks!  This is a terrific series..a real period piece that opens a window into history..
Smart and free of junk.... really enjoy the solving of problems. A must see for those who love mysteries. Watch it.
"Love the series.  Truly quality show.  The story lines is great and the acting superb.  Once you start, you will watch them all."
"Just love the British dramas because they are not shoot em up, young  and always flirting and showing boobs and sex scenes.  I watch for the story.  If I want to watch porn I'll watch it. American shows are just too unbelievable.Foyle is real, down to earth, intelligently thoughtful, and a real man."
"Very good series. I enjoy them very much. World War II era, with very interesting insights in to war time England. Fairly good plots."
More of the WW II situation for those at home in Britian.  Interesting how they view the &#34;Yanks.&#34;Worth your time.
"Great show!  I enjoy the understated English acting.  The shows are not predictable, which makes them more interesting.  Can't wait for each subsequent episode."
Outstanding show. Actors are realistic. Plots so different from usual TV shows. An interesting look at England during a time befroe most of us were very young or not even born.
"This is high quality British detective entertainment at its best, all with accurate WWII era events alongside.  I highly recommend it."
"These stories are lots of fun to watch.  Sure, it's funny that all of the murders just happen to take place where one of the detectives are involved, but it's entertainment at its best, in my opinion.Great way to spend some time."
"I love this series.  It's set in Hastings, London in pre-war and during WWII.  Foyle's calm demeanor is fantastic as are his sleuth abilities.  I can't believe the season only has 3 episodes!"
"Does it really matter that everything takes place in the prewar-war torn UK? I think not, this is procedural crime solving at its best. The characters feel real and as the series progresses, one becomes involved with them and what transpires in their lives. I was hesitant at first, I grew up listening to my father's &#34;war stories&#34; and saw almost every WWII TV show/documentary/movie ever made during the 50s and 60s. I really didn't want to see more of the same. This is very different, its about people, well one man, Christopher Foyle, and what happens in his life while he masterfully solves crimes. You can watch his process while he solves the current mystery (the UK, especially in the small villages, is rife with murder it seems) all the while trying to do his bit in the war effort. If you like well-acted British crime drama, try it."
"I gave Poirot, series 6, a top rating of 5 stars because David Suchet, as always, is stunningly delightful in the roll. When reading the original books, he is exactly what one envisions Poirot to be, making the films spring to life. And it doesn't hurt that the production company takes such care to make it a period piece, with housing, furnishings, costumes, manners, even idioms of speech, complete to the time frame. May Poirot's &#34;little grey cells&#34; never fail to delight one and all!"
I always enjoy Poirot.  He never fails to discover who the culprit is in his episodes.  The fashion of that time is interesting. I love his character in the stories.
"Thank you for the new episodes.  We have been known to watch Poirot shows more than once.  This may be common for many, but our family rarely watches a show a second time.  We do Poirot, though.  He is always interesting."
"Poirot the 6th series is a great series. I think David Suchet is Poirot and I love to see him in action. I have seen most of the Poirot programs, but I love to watch them over again. I highly recommend this series for Agatha Christie lovers"
"I love how he gets his quotes a little off,  For example, 'Quiet as a chapel mouse'!  It's fun to watch this detective story.  He's definitely one of a kind,"
"I love this entire series with David Suchet as Hercule Poirot. The adaptations of Agatha Christie's novels or short stories are very well done. When I wish to watch a mystery, I always come back to this entire series, just as I reread Agatha Christie Books from Kindle. Thanks Amazon for making  these available!"
I've always liked reading Agatha Christie but I'm enthralled with David Suchet as Poirot.  I like the deductive reasoning and the scenery is so amazing and filming techniques are wonderful.
Seasons one through six are my very favorite because they were able to weave in some sly humor and there was a great supporting cast.  These earlier seasons are far superior to the later seasons (9-12) which do not include the supporting cast or delicate innuendos that make Poirot so memorable.  And yet they are all good.  It is just that seasons one through six are great.
"Agatha C. has done it again with another fantastic season.  Don't miss a minute of it, you will love it."
"Fabulous.  Four terrific mysteries presented on four disks, all featuring the greatest sleuth since..............?Hercule Poirot (vividly portrayed by David Suchet) is called upon to solve some confounding murders.  The first disrupts his holiday.  A cantankerous old man fears someone is out to kill him and all the suspects are his relatives.  (""If I had an enemy I'd cut his throat."")  The second case is far more complicated, involving thefts, smuggling, and murder.  The third case, Murder on the Links, comes about when Captain Hastings (Hugh Fraser) has ulterior motives for the vacation `they' are taking.  They end up at the Hotel Du Golf and fall into a trap of instant intrigue.  The last mystery is the most fun.  It features the best guest star they've ever employed.........Bob, a dog with ball and just one trick he doesn't mind endlessly repeating.  ""Dog!  You will sit!""Happy to add this to my collection so I can enjoy them anytime I want."
"It's REMASTERED. Of course it's reissued as series 6. 4 Poirots. Previously aired/released episodes, but now with better picture. According to friends using Blu-ray, it's great if you have a large screen. Excellent on normal DVDs too. Sets being offered are in original UK airing order. I've listed episodes, so check and see if you already own them.If not, this is a grand opportunity for those new to this Belgian with `little gray cell' who out-sleuths `The Yard.' David Suchet made Poirot famous. Philip Jackson plays Chief Inspector Japp in 2 episodes. Hastings (Hugh Fraser) Poirot's right-hand arrives in two episodes. Miss Lemon (Pauline Moran) is back for one episode.I've never been disappointed with Poirot. Agatha Christie stories always fantastic, but Suchet makes adaptations soar to new heights. Humor, scenic bliss, and costumes rival script brilliance. It's tough cutting books to 100 TV minutes. This series does it well. Trivially note: Poirot fictional character was granted a 1975 New York Times front page obit.SUBTITLE option available for all 4 feature-length episodes. Guest stars aplenty, as normal.~~~~~Hercule Poirot's Christmas- 1995The detective Poirot takes a holiday. A family Christmas gathering leaves a man murdered, apparently by one of his adult children. So much for a cozy Christmas by the Yule log.~~~~~Hickory Dickory Dock- 1995Petty theft turns to murder in a heartbeat, or lack of. Miss Lemon convinces Poirot to look in crime in her sister's hostel. See Jonathan Firth playing Nigel, yes Colin's brother.~~~~~Murder on the Links- 1996Poirot's and Hastings' reputations travel to France. Oui, Oui, more murder, kidnapping, downright nasty crime for the pair to sleuth. Some just die for a game of French golf.~~~~~Dumb Witness- 1996It's more than a family affair, and estate planning. Poirot and Hastings solve a murder through strange means. Communications with...""Speak doggie, speak."" I first saw Kate Buffery starring in the good ""Wish Me Luck"" war series.`"
"The Poirot series, for me, is some of the most enjoyable programing on television.  The beautiful settings and David Suchet make for a perfect and relaxing evening."
"David Suchet is the classic Poirot. Amazon instant video for Prime subscribers is the easiest delivery system. Amazon has difficulty streaming at times, but the inconvenience is minimal."
"Hands down, David Suchet does not define Poirot, he has captured the essence of &#34;Poirot&#34;. Others are interesting, Suchet isthe &#34;standard&#34;."
"Although Season 6 only contains 4 stories, it is well worth having as the stories are classic Agatha Christie with all the twists and turns she is well noted for. If you have never read Christie, now is the time to enjoy her devious mind."
I love the puzzles these Agatha Christie movies present partly because the director and the actors are so good.
Great stories and excellent acting. The setting is England (primarily) in the thirties. Every time I watch this or any of the other Poirot series I am amazed at the mannerisms of David Suchet and how his character never changes (to any great extent). Watch this series and you will most likely watch all Poirot's adventures.
"I watched all of these on PBS, bought and watched DVDs of them all, and now have watched them all again.  Of course I read the books years ago also.They never get old.David Suchet is such a perfect Poirot it as if he and Miss Christie were of one mind."
Wonderfully dry humor and great acting by the entire cast.  A great period piece with beautiful scenery and clothes to die for.
My addicton to Agatha Christie and Cavid Suchet has been appeased - for a while.  I can watch him every day and never tire of his reactions to suspects.  Don't expect reality.  Sit back and enjoy.
"Poirot & David Suchet ... does it get any better.  The scenes are rich in the decor of the time, which adds to the enjoyment."
"Herccule never disappoints withnhis &#34;little grey cells&#34; but I love watching the settings which are put together with such care as to be as close as possible to the real thing.  The clothes,hair, trains, cars, jewelry--all are perfect."
Poirot  is one of my favorite Agatha Christie's characters. David Suchet makes the character come alive . Never a dull moment.
One of my favorite detectives - He doesn't drive or like violence. Does not carry a gun and doesn't take down the bad guys with his physical strength. He's just Poirot solving cases of National Importance with the psychology.
"I love, love the Poirot series.  Only wish the rest were available with Prime.  The time period, the buildings, trains, planes, and cars.  All make for fun watching.  You really do get a feel for the period .  And of course, the mysteries are worth the watch..."
Well done adaptation with excellent actors bringing the characters to life. The lack of fund raising interruptions or commercials adds greatly to the enjoyment.
"For Series 6 LWT (London Weekend Television) ran out of short stories and reverted back to the two hour format used in season 4, drawing stories from the longer Poirot Novels. (Series 5 used the Short Stories.)This would be the last series for LWT to produce Poirot.  Granada Television would do a hostile take over of LWT and the Poirot series would go on hiatus until the A&E; Network would pick it up in 2000.Technically this would not be a real broadcast season as it was spread out over three years. It is just the last of the LWT productions.The classic two hour mysteries are:42  6-01  01/January/95  ""HERCULE POIROT'S CHRISTMAS""43  6-02  12/February/95  ""HICKORY, DICKORY, DOCK""44  6-03  11/February/96  ""MURDER ON THE LINKS""45  6-04  16/March/97  ""DUMB WITNESS""Even though these were filmed in 16mm, re-mastering them in Hi-Definition from the original 16mm camera films will produce a sharper image than the old 1995/1997 standard definition transfers made from 16mm copies, created from 16mm dupe negatives.Now if only A&E; would re-master their series 7, 8, 9, &10 from the original films, UNCUT. Yes the old A&E; DVDs have some edits."
"David Suchet is remarkable in his Poirot part, bringing the little Belgian detective to life as described by Christie.  I have seen all of the shows several times and still enjoy them."
Great videos. Hate to see them end. I will watch these over and over and find something I may have missed the first time.
"Hercule is sooo funny when he says he's not French; he's just so offended. Honestly, I love this character and all of the episodes."
Loved the first 5 in the series and this was great too. I strongly recommend the series. David Suchet is marvelous.
Five minutes into the series I realized I had already viewed all of them. The perfection of Suchet's performances coupled with the consummate attention to detail observed by the production company prompted me to watch them all again. Superb!!
I love all the episodes of Poirot.  He is so amusing and entertaining.  I like Poirot's funny moustache; he is quite a character.
"I love Poirot!!  I love the characters.  The series has great writers, and the set design has so much detail.  It's like being transported back to the time when the story was taking place.  The clothes, the vehicles, foods, everything is so authentic.  Poirot is so brilliant, and observant, that I can never guess who the culprit is.  It's a great series and I can see why it is so popular."
I love series 5 of the Poirot series. We learn a lot about Poirot as a young policeman and detective. We learn how he got the silver lapel pin he always wears. I believe he was in love. It is a great series and David Suchet does a wonderful job. I highly recommend this series to all Agatha Christie lovers.
"the in character detail that David Suchet brings to the role is, well Over The Top.I watch it every evening - chapter by chapter."
"I could be anyone, it would be Det. Poirot. The actor is a most amazing person...just like the master detective of all time."
I will love poirot always.  David Suchet is the best. Please add more seasons to prime as well as miss marple also.
"Season 5 is one of the best with ""The Dead Man's Mirror"" and ""The Case of the Missing Will"" taking top honors. David Suchet's portrayal brings to life Agatha Christie's Belgian detective; unlike any actor before him. He is to Poirot, what Jeremy Brett was to Sherlock Holmes. These Eight include some of the best episodes; you have Hastings, Inspector Japp and Miss Lemon all in fine form. I would recommend this season to anyone needing a bit intellectual entertainment."
"Definitely my favorite seasons were seasons one through six.  The supporting cast was terrific and the story lines superb.  But what is extra special is the attention to detail and some of the sly humor (esp in the early seasons).  If you love rich settings, incredible acting, British humor and great unpredictable story lines, then you will love Poirot!"
"Have watched this series numerous times. Need more bbc mystery videos available on prime, such as Hetty Wainthrop, Midsomer Murders and even Jeeves and Wooster.Oh and if anyone is interested in aristocratic life during Edwardian period, watch Manor House. Excellent!"
I love this series! I've watched every episode twice and am on my third viewing. There simply isn't anything to compare. I've watched Poirot acted by different actors for a few of the episodes. They are alright but nothing to get excited about. David Suchet plays the part of Hercule with impeccable taste and accuracy. He captures the character with every gesture. It is a real pleasure to watch the master at his craft.
"Great fun. Always entertaining and I like to try figuring out the solution before Poirot does...hasn't happened yet but I'll keep trying.  David Suchet as Poirot is wonderful. Clean, satisfying entertainment at it best."
"The Poirot adventures with David Suchet--which began nearly a quarter century ago and just recently concluded--are some of the best classic British mysteries on television. That they were saddled for years with crappy DVD transfers was a shame. But now you can enjoy pristine Blu Rays of the original Super 16 footage; they look fantastic. If you watch your Poirots as much as my wife and I do, you owe it to yourself to pick up the Blu Rays. It's well worth buying the shows a second time."
Miss Lemon and Chief Inspector Jepp are back and the timing is back to 50 minutes. Very Manageable to watch.
I simply find the series very entertaining! The stories usually catch my attention and hold my interest all the way thru. Bravo!
"REMASTERED set 5 is 8 Poirots. Belgian with `little gray cell' out-sleuths `The Yard.' David Suchet made Poirot famous. Philip Jackson plays Chief Inspector Japp in last 5 episodes. Hastings (Hugh Fraser) Poirot's right-hand is available for all but one episode. Miss Lemon (Pauline Moran) in 6 episodes. Agatha Christie stories always fantastic, but Suchet makes the film adaptations soar to new heights. Humor, scenic bliss, and costume lust rival the script writing. Poirot stories began a 1920s era. Trivially noteworthy, the fictional character was granted a 1975 NYTimes front page obit.Odd that some are yet trying to sell (one reviewer promote) the older set, not remastered, for more $, up to $1000. New Series 5 is a value to new buyers or those who want the crisper image, Blu-ray level target. My vote's with newer, better, & America (even though it is Brit TV).SUBTITLE option available for all episodes. Aired first in 1993. 407 min. and now in the original UK order. Guest stars aplenty, as normal.-_-_-The Adventure of the Egyptian TombDr. Ames is Rolf Saxon (Saving Pvt Ryan). We've all heard of the Egyptian Pharaoh tomb curses. True? Ghastly-ghostly deaths.

Auctions have losers, & but one winner.-_-_-Yellow IrisA 2nd chance. Poirot failed to solve a crime, can he do it the second time around? A London reenactment of an Argentine dinner of death. Suicide or murder? Hubby (David Troughton) wants to know.-_-_-The Case of the Missing Will1926. Poirot has more than a crime to solve, he being the dead man's confident in estate planning changes.

"The production and acting are superb. My wife and I enjoy Poirot on a relaxed Sunday eveningto end our week. Easy ,entertaining, well acted ...a great period series."
"In season five, I have met several stories that I do not recall reading so that is a plus for me. I have read and re-read most of Agatha Christie's Poirot and Miss Marple masterpieces so to locate a new one is great."
We have always enjoyed all of Poirot's episodes - Agatha Christie is a writer of the top quality.  Never disappointing.
"David Suchet is wonderful in these productions and portrays Agatha Christie's Poirot perfectly. The director, the music and the actors are excellent."
"Another season and another winner.  Great stories, fast paced and original.  I am so looking forward to another season. HP is a character and a half.  His careful solving of each crime is a delight."
"David Suchet is Poirot - and the supporting characters do not disappoint either.  This series defines the character, the essence of period.  Sit back and enjoy the show."
"This series has some of the most intriguing shows, Once again Amazon's streaming has been flawless . The video is clear in HD  with perfect sound quality."
"What a joy!  Poirot  leads me along in the mystery and I follow with no regret. I love the stories, the period clothing, the locations and of course the actors and actresses."
I love the little dectective.  I have enjoyed all of thisw series.  It is not filled with words I do not want my grandchildren to hear and use.  It doesn't have a lot of violence and sexual scenes.
Love watching him put those little gray cells to work
"Series 5 returns to the one-hour format basing the stories on the Poirot Short Stories.These had been previously released in various Poirot Collections using the old 1993 film to video transfers in standard definition. Now ITV has gone back to the original camera films to do new Hi-Definition transfers, making the series look fresh and new.The eight great one hour episodes here are:34  5-01 17/January/93  ""THE ADVENTURES OF THE EGYPTIAN TOMB""35  5-02  24/January/93  ""THE UNDERDOG""36  5-03  31/January/93  ""THE YELLOW IRIS""37  5-04  07/February/93  ""THE CASE OF THE MISSING WILL""38  5-05  14/February/93  ""THE ADVENTURES OF THE ITALIAN NOBLEMAN""39  5-06  21/February/93  ""THE CHOCOLATE BOX""40  5-07  28/February/93  ""DEAD MAN'S MIRROR41  5-08  07/March/93  ""JEWEL ROBBERY AT THE GRAND METROPOLITAN""While these may have been filmed in 16mm, going back to the original camera 16mm film elements to create this transfer will always look better than a 1993 standard definition transfer of a 16mm copy made from a 16mm dubbing negative.The next series, #6, would be the last season to be produced by LWT (London Weekend Television) when Granada Television did a hostile take-over of the company.Those series #6 movies appeared in the DVD Poirot Movie Collection #2.Series 7, 8, 9, & 10 were produced by itv and A&E-TV.;  They were produced in widescreen but A&E; cropped them. Now Acorn offers them in widescreen.Series #11 & 12 were previously released on DVD movie sets 4, 5,& 6.  Look for the new series 13 in 2014."
"Poirot is highly self-assured and somewhat arrogant but lovable all the same.  I watch these episodes repeatedly, and they never get old - delightful :)"
I really enjoy watching Poirot the way he talks and walks and how humorous he is. The show is very entertaining and Poirot always gets the bad guy's or bad ladies. 5 stars for Poirot.
"David Suchet's portrayal of Poirot brings Agatha Christie's detective to life. The settings are beautiful, costuming spot on, casting true, with BBC quality to the series. I HIGHLY recommend Poirot and hope you enjoy it as much as I do."
Best entertainment. There should be more of these kinds of series today. I hope they make more in Poirot's old age!
David Suchet is the best actor I've seen portray Agatha Christie's Belgian detective Hercule Poirot.  I love the art deco sets and costumes.  The video quality is very good.  I enjoy seeing Christie's stories come to life.
I love this series. The episodes just keep getting better and the consistency is wonderful. The cast is great and I just love the series.
Clever and amusing with just a touch of intrigue. Costuming and historically accurate. Does Agatha Christi proud. SUCHET is grand!
"David Suchet is always great, and these mysteries are no exception.  I end up watching one after the other for hours."
I am a big fan of Agatha Christie's Poirot and the PBS  programs are wonderful. David Suchet is a marvelous Poirot and plays him masterfully. It is a pleasure to watch these programs and I highly recommend them to any Poirot fan.
"As always, he's a cool guy....wish he lived next door! I find his little quirks so wonderful, makes me happy to watch!"
"Season 4 is one of the best from start to finish. David Suchet's portrayal brings to life Agatha Christie's Belgian detective; unlike any actor before him. He is to Poirot, what Jeremy Brett was to Sherlock Holmes. These are three of the longer; not to mention some of the best episodes; with ""Death in the Clouds"" and ""One, Two, Buckle My Shoe"" taking top honors. I highly recommend this season to anyone needing a bit intellectual entertainment, you won't be disappointed."
"We continually watch these.  Love Poirot and captain Hastings. Doesn't make any difference how many times spew watch, we still love them."
"More terrific mysteries featuring Hercule Poirot (David Suchet), three feature length movies on three disks.  The first concerns a series of murders seemingly unrelated but for the alphabetical order of the victim's names.  Hastings returns from a trip just in time to help his friend solve the case (""what does a madman look like?"").  My favorite scene shows the two men in Poirot's kitchen washing dishes.The second mystery involves several flights Poirot would rather not take, a blackmailer, and too many suspects with perfect alibis (""I didn't know she was going to be murdered."").The third mystery is a heady mixture of confusion when too many seemingly insignificant people are murdered.I can't get enough of these excellent productions.  I feel obligated to watch them all in one sitting."
Sometimes an actor can go stale in a series but not David Suchet. He is as strong as at the start. These episodes are longer (1.75 hrs) than the usual ones - they must have been 2 partes on Masterpirece Mystery.
"Remastered series 4 is 3 102 min. murders solved by Poirot, the masterful Belgian `little gray cell' man who forever out-sleuths Scotland Yard. Brilliant David Suchet is Poirot, enough said. Philip Jackson plays Chief Inspector Japp in all 3 episodes having a larger than previous role in 2 & 3 since Hastings (Hugh Fraser) Poirot's right-hand is available for only the first episode. Being all Agatha Christie stories makes it fantastic, but Suchet makes the film adaptations soar to new heights. Humor and some fantastic scenery and costuming appear in these. Poirot stories began in 1920 and the fictional character was granted a 1975 NYTimes front page obit.SUBTITLES option available for all 3 episodes. Aired first in1992, set 4 of the re-released series now being offered in order of the original TV airings.`The ABC Murders' 1936 (also book release year) Jim Hastings returns to help Poirot who's anxious for a crime to solve. A murderer taunts Poirot with letters announcing deaths and signing himself as ABC. Victims are not as random as they seem, quickly discovered, but alphabetical. Star Donald Sumpter plays Cust, a stocking salesman. Donald Fraser played by Nicholas Farrell (A Woman of Alexander Bonaparte Cust are standout.`Death in the Clouds' Agatha's 1935 publication seems to be taking place in that year. Poirot flies from Paris to London when a murder occurs on the flight making even Poirot a suspect, plus all aboard. Madame Giselle (Eve Pearce- `Lyyton's Diary') dies and Japp wants Poirot's help even if he may have been the killer. Lady Horbury (Cathryn Harrison) is delightful in lavish period costumes. Stewardess Grey (Sarah Woodward) super as Poirot's helper and catch Jenny Downham playing daughter Anne. See Paris of old, and an early passenger plane interior. Sets to drool over.`One, Two, Buckle My Shoe' begins in 1925 ten jumps to 1937 (book from 1940) where Poirot has visited his dentist, who is shot, suicide?, or is Poirot again suspect with other patients? More good acting by Japp, who calls in the Belgian for assistance and questioning. A host of stars are suspects. Alaistar Blunt (Peter Blyth) rich banker; Fascist Carter (Christopher Eccleston); Mabelle; Sylvia (Joanna Phillips-Lane); cameo by (Mary Healey); Gladys (Karen Gledhill), and so many more the diversions, timeline, and trickery takes Poirot a full 17 minutes to explain at the end. Art Deco building exteriors are superb. Another feast of costume and set. Suspense is always a given."
I am elated when they began releasing Poirot in Blue-Ray. You can't go wrong with this.Keep 'em coming..I want them all!
There is only ONE Poirot and his name is David Suchet. Kudos to the other members of the ensemble cast which make this series perfect.
The bit of extra time per episode made this season just that much more exceptional! Again the costuming and set decoration was amazing!
I love the simplicity of this detective. He reminds me of Sherlock Holmes except he keeps things to himself until the end. He is also a French Belgin that does not think much of English food.
"Great Series... if you like mysteries, and Agatha Christie, you will enjoy this series, and the period scenery as erll"
Agatha Christie must have had David Suchet in mind to play the part of Poirot when she wrote her books. The whole cast is perfect. Suchet gets his point across with a raised eyebrow or a frown or whatever suits the situation. The rest of the players are great support for the whole show.
One of all time favorite detectives - Love all episodes - wish there were more. No one can outsmart Poirot.
Agatha Christie hasn't been popular all the years for nothing!  David Suchet bring Poirot into vivid focus time and again.
Love this series and love poirot strange little man but great storylines and love trying to work it out before poirot
"Series 4 was the first full season to switch from Agatha Christie's Poirot Short Stories to her Poirot Novels (two had already been produced in 1990), thus creating feature length TV episodes.These had been previously released in various ""Poirot Movie Collections"" using the old 1992 film to video transfers in standard definition. Now ITV, the owner of LWT programs, has gone back to the original camera films to do new Hi-Definition transfers, making the series look fresh and new.The three great two hour episodes here are:31  4-01  05/January/92  ""THE A.B.C. MURDERS""32  4-02  12/January/92  ""DEATH IN THE CLOUDS""33  4-03  19/January/92  ""ONE, TWO, BUCKLE MYSHOE""While these may have been filmed in 16mm, going back to0 the original camera 16mm film elements to create this transfer will always look better than a 1992 standard definition transfer of a 16mm copy made from a 16mm dubbing negative."
"The brilliant Agatha Christie's &#34;Poirot&#34; and David Suchet were made for each other! They started out as great and grew into fabulous, as did Christie's characters. Suchet makes the formerly somewhat stuffy Poirot, especially as depicted in old movies, not as endearing as he is in these Masterpiece Theatre creations which make you want to invite this little man into your home and watch his &#34;little gray cells&#34; go to work. The series just gets better and better. My third wish is that it could go on forever. it is so good."
"I like everything about these programs, the scenes, costumes, characters, sets and music.  They are a special art and David Suchet the ideal Poiirot.  Well, I warned you not to expect objectivity."
All of the Poirot Series with David Suchet playing Poirot are the best ever filmed.  Highly recommended for lovers of British mystery series.
"Poirot is always the best!  You will never guess who the culpret is.  Always give him 5 stars.  You will positively love the plots, the background, the estates used, the costumes, in a word, all."
Poriot should be brought back just as Sherlock Holmes has be reborn.  David Suchet will always own the part as he brings this character to life with grace and humor.  I tend not to watch films over and over again but Poriot is the exception.
I always like to watch Poirot episodes.  He is so amusing and such an interesting man playing the detective in these videos. I love looking at the fashions and old cars.  And it is fun to watch these episodes unfold.
I can hardly finish watching before my husband takes over.  We both love them all and will continue to watch.
"I just love the Poirot series  with David Suchet. It is so interesting. Even though I seen some of the series, I usually can't remember who did it until the very end. It is a real pleasure to watch this series and I highly recommend it to all Agatha Christie fans."
"As stated previously, I love this character and if I could have him my life, I would be delighted thoroughly."
"I will make this real short and sweet..If you like Agatha Christiyou will love all the Poirot..I do and have watched them manytimes over..they are wonderfully scripted, being TRUE to the bookand David Suchet has captured her character perfectly.All the actors  perfectly cast and the era is historically correct inall aspects..There is a little of something for everyone and it's ashow  you can watch with or by all ages.  So get your popcorn, sit back andenjoy.  This is a class act and consistently so."
Each episode is as good or better than the last. The plots are so well thought out and always manage to surprise at the end. An excellent choice for any mystery buff.
Season 2  continue to grow in complexity and smart storylines.  I love the immaculate historical setting for this series in 1920s - 1930's England.  Anyone who likes mysteries will enjoy such a high quality british based series.  Poirot is from Belgium but it is enjoyable that everyone keeps thinking he is a Frenchman in England.
"Screen writing is excellent.  Recommend entertaining and good family viewing.  Logical results most episodes.  The better of BBC mysteries, Suchet portrays Poirot well."
Perfect gentleman; proper manners with intelligence in solving crimes with his &#34;little grey cells &#34;; Miss Lemon ; Deputy inspector Japp and colonel Hastings Poirot's posse.
Agatha Christie's Poirot stories are just  the right note for a late night viewing before going to sleep or on a rainy afternoon.  The stories always keep my interest even though I have seen them more than once.  People who have read and enjoyed the books will enjoy the videos.
"Have always loved these mysteries, but David Suchet is wonderful as Poirot.  I only wish they had made more of these.  Great stories, costumes, and the many cities where they take place.  Makes you want to travel."
Although Peter Ustinov played Hercule in a movie as did someone else (that I forget) - he is the perfect Poirot. And the episode where he retires and leaves everything up to Hastings is really entertaining. Every episode is a winner - even though this was made 20 some years ago.
"This is the best made television out there. No American made show or series comes close. The dialogue, the sets, the wardrobe, the lighting, locations and cinematography and characters are top of the line. The staging is staggering in the first six seasons; the quality control falls off in some episodes later on. Perhaps because you get used to an exquisite product watching the first six seasons. Agatha Christie would be proud; maybe intimidated by the way her stories have been brought to life.  Every detail is spared no expense and continuity is unmatched. I can watch these over and over in spite of the fact that I know the ending and who the villain is. If you have never see a Poirot episode it&#8217;s well worth your time to watch. John Strickland is an excellent director and Suchet, and cast is top notch. With a cinematographer like Gavin Finney  casting by Susie Parriss, production design by  Jeff Tessler  and kudos to the entire production team, they are one of the best ever assembled."
"Any POIROT set is just plain GOOD murder mystery. Agatha Christie suspense perfect. David Suchet acting excellence. Combined they make any British Mystery viewer salivate. Add top guest stars in each, SUBTITLES for the hearing and dialect challenged, and kick in some of the best filmed period mystery ever produced. It's what fans have come to expect with Poirot, Agatha Christie, Masterpiece Mystery, and the untouchable as Hercule Poirot--David Suchet.The Blu-rays and new DVDs are newly remastered and restored to their original U.K. broadcast order. This is wonderful mystery TV, never to get out of date. You WILL love every episode."
You will always get a high rating from me for any Agatha Christie book that has Hercule Poirot as the main character.
Do enjoy Poirot - we watch them often.  Only problem is in that some of them. the video freezes - then a complicated process of returning to the particular video.  Believe I have to go to th Help site for that problemWorth watching.
David Suchet is amazing as Poirot! I can't imagine anyone better. The set direction and costuming are over the top!
I hate unnecessary violence so I enjoy a good Agatha Christie Poirot murder mystery because of the excellent plotting without the unnecessary violence. Her plots are about solving the puzzle with all the important clues included.
"Loved this series, I'm an Agatha fan.  I enjoy reading and like all the series, Poirot is best when you pay attention to what is going on at all times.  Enjoy!!"
I am looking forward to watching all the years of the series that are on Amazon Prime.  He knows how to solve a crime.  It often seems that all the pieces fall together at just the right time and he dazzles us with his insight.
Please get the rest of the series  thanks youDavid Suchet is the ONLY Poirot......  You will enjoy itThank You aMAZON
Good clean shows. Even the murders are neat and clean. You can never  guess who done it. Hope to see more of the same in the future.
An English detective series very well written and a fine cast of actors. Most of the shows will keep your interest as you don't know the culprit till the end.
Love his character...and series. Cases of national importance. Hastings and Ms Lemon are perfect in their roles as well. Good stuff.
"The cast is inspired. I can't imagine a different Poirot, Chief Inspector Japp, Captain Hastings or Miss Lemon. Also love the costumes and sets."
"I really enjoyed this movie, I like all the Poirot movies he is quite entertaining and very well acted, love it."
Poirot is the ultimate detective.  David Suchet makes him so believable.  I love Captain Hastings and the secretary too.  Jolly
Poirot's quirky personality is as fascinating as the mysteries that he solves.  The &#34;art deco&#34; decor scattered throughout the scenes is interesting too.
Excellent acting and production values and what is so great about these is that they are faithful to the stories and have a Poirot who is the ultimate Poirot.
There should be more of these kinds of series. Agatha Chritie is brilliant portraying her mysteries. Hercule Poirot is an amazing detectve with all his quirks. The more you watch..the more you know what his facial expressions mean.
"I'm a Christie fan and feel Poirot, Series 2, has been true to the short stories written byAgatha Christie.  I love the fabulous Art Deco sets and costumes."
"I love the series, love David Suchet and although I love Peter Ustinov in the character, I think Suchet does a superb job with the character, he is just so much fun to watch.The stories are great, the production details are wonderful and the episodes are extremely well done - great job PBS!"
"Poirot is always fun to read and this is a good tv series.  A bit changed, but very well done.  I am a Agatha Christie fan so this series is my cup of tea.  Good quality camera work too!"
"I love this show. It is good in all the ways a series should be. However, it is a set piece and will likely bore the hell out of you if you watch with your i-whatever in your hand. Not for the millennial at heart; it's for the older set, for people who enjoy great acting, writing, directing, cinematography and a continental pace. Nobody is call anyone by a disgusting name, no one is going to make repeated bodily function jokes, and no one is going to insult your intelligence. So if you can stand not having those elements in your face for a change, this series is PERFECT. If you just HAVE to answer that last tweet, you twit,  then skip this one.I love it, I've watched it so much I can repeat the lines; I know what will happen and whodunit, and yet I and totally entertained every time, and I hope you will be too."
"David Suchet is the perfect &#34;Poirot.&#34;  This series is always a pleasure for me to watch again and again, well written, well photographed, and well acted."
"I've said this before elsewhere and I'll gladly say it again here. David Suchet is the ultimate Hercule Poirot. I enjoy this series immensely because the production companies involved in the creation of the programs seem to strive for perfection. The sets, locations and especially the costumes are superb. The episodes have only one weakness that I can see and that is the dialogue. On extremely rare occasions the characters will use an expression such as &#34;excuse me&#34; to indicate a hearing problem. This practice was not used in that time period for that reason. But I'm majoring in the minors here. All the Poirot programs are wonderful and I recommend them to everyone."
"The kids positively are hooked onto this one, they just want to go through the episodes, back to back. Highly recommended."
"My daughter loves to watch this show. She started watching Umizoomi's at about 21 months. She loves watching this right up with Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, Backyardigans, Dora and Bubble Guppies..."
My grand daughter who is 20 months loves this show. She stops whatever she is doing and runs in to watch it.
i am the dad that loves this show as much as my kids (4 and 2). I wish all seasons were included with amazon prime.
My 2 yr old grandson loves watching this show. Thanks for sharing this programing through Amazon Prime. We will continue to watch it.
"My toddler loves Mili, Geo, and Bot. This show occasionally gets on my nerves (especially when my toddler makes me sing the theme song 439758475238490 times in a row) but it's so worth it. I did so terribly in math when I was in school because I believed that because I was a girl, I could not do math. I felt so worthless and stupid. In fact, I had anxiety attacks all through college because of it. I love that there's a show out there empowering kids (especially girls) to do math. I love that there's a female superhero who is smart and not dressed up like something out of a male fantasy. If this helps give my child a little bit more confidence later on down the road, then it will be worth it to have to sing, &#34;you've got mighty math power&#34; as many times as I have to!"
Cute characters and uses counting and shapes for their adventures.  It's a good show when I want my granddaughter to take a break.
Great show for preschoolers.  My grandchildren love it! Emphasizes friendship and helping friends and those in need.  Focuses on math skills including patterns and measurement.
"Saw it on cable, got rid of cable and started streaming.  Exactly the same and it is one of my kids' favorites."
My 4yr old Daughter used to watch this when we had cable.  We have Amazon Prime instead and was so glad to see this added!  She loves watching it.  Great show for young minds!
"What child's video experience would not be complete without Team Umizoomi to show them the beauty of shapes and numbers. First saw this for my child on Nickelodeon and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. You cannot go wrong with this video collection for your young, growing children. Enjoy."
"my daughter and son are crazy for Team Umizoomi, they watch the episodes multiple times back to back, they are crazy for the show."
"We can't get enough of these guys.  I love the fact that they make numbers fun for my son.  As well as teach him his shapes, colors and patterns.  Great problem solving and communication skills are fostered also.  We love 'em!"
There are definitely advantages to being a grandparent! Colorful and fun way to learn shapes and numbers while teaching cooperation. Recommended for ages 2 - 5.
"This is an enjoyable and educational show for toddlers.  It has an easy to follow format that will help your child learn, as well as be entertained."
"Umizoomi Season 1 (and all other seasons) captivates both my 18 month old grandson and my four year old granddaughter.  It is my fall back for every occasion, especially desperate moments (car travel, silently in church, waiting for food at restaurants, etc.).  I appreciate the fact that the children are learning while they are entertained.  I will even admit that the adults in the family sing every tune as well."
"Team Umizoomi is a wonderful show for young children.  I don't care if screen time is bad, My 2 year old son loves this show, loudly answers all the questions, sings along, and is learning counting, colors, shapes and patterns.  Also I love the punkish theme song. And my husband and I really enjoy making up alternative lyrics to &#34;Shapes all over the place&#34;"
Fun little movie that you used to be able to find on regular television in the past. Grandchildren enjoy it and learn from it.
My 3 ur old loves this group of characters. They are bright colored full of happy energy. She laying snuggled in bed and watches laughing and giggling and yelling at he screen.Thank you
This little cartoon is my son's favorite show right now!  It has a plus of being educational as well as entertaining. There's a lot about math and counting.
"The imagery and artwork is beautifully done. The pace is exciting without being too overstimulating and frazzling like many of the other kids shows on today. The cartoon show is rather different than others, my kids love the show for it's music and counting skills. As long they enjoy this show as they do with others, I will keep my subs for Prime."
This series about little elf-like kids is entertaining as well as teaching younger ones how to work together and solve problems. Good preschool show!
"My 2 year old has watched this show since he was 1. He loves it so much that he sleeps with his Millie, Geo and Bot dolls and loves to play with the vehicles and figures. He counts to 15 like a champ and we are always working on more. He knows his shapes too! We work with him too but a lot comes from the show. It's amazing!"
Really nice educational program. Both kids 4 and 6 love to watch this.My daughter loves to learn math with team Umizoomi.
This is a great show for children in pre-k or even younger. It really helps introduce counting and small arithmetic operations such as adding and subtracting small numbers. The characters are very kid friendly and their adventures involve real people as well as other animated characters. You cannot go wrong with this show!
"Great animation, music and engaging stories plus education in shapes, patterns and math. Who could ask for more In a just-right series for the pre-school set? Our guys love it!"
"Kiddo loves this show and so do I. She's almost two and doesn't watch hours of tv (and we co-view), but there are times and places (traveling) when it's nice for her to enjoy a show. Especially one that makes her think and dance! She loves Milli and Geo like crazy. Particularly in the episodes where they sing. She's learned from the show not only to count past ten, but up to one hundred by ones and tens! She's learned all her shapes from this show too. How many almost two year olds know what a trapezoid is? Or an octagon? All the Team Umizoomi kids! My only complaint is if she's having an off toddler day where she's over reactive, there's a LOT of OH NO! type of over-dramatics on the show. While this can make it fun for her, some days when she gets upset easily over nothing, she almost gets stressed out -- especially the kitty down the well episode even though she asks for and loves that one! So overall it's great and just a ton of fun, but please co-view as there are rare days when it's a bit too much OH NO! drama."
"This is a great, family friendly, show that helps kids with shapes and counting. It's fun entertainment and the kids love it."
My grandson enjoys and will request this series.  The characters portray being helpful and making good choices.  Nice to see something that reinforces values!
Haven't watched the show in a long time. It's still fun to watch. I'm glad it got add to prime.
This is a classic cartoon from my teen years. My wife and I love watching it and were so excited that the whole series is on Amazon Prime.
I even had one best friend who was an artist. Daria is timeless. There will always be young women like Daria and Jane in high school wishing they were somewhere else. I watch to have a chuckle at the absurdities of social interactions which never change down through the generations.
"This is an intelligently written and performed characterization of the quiet, sarcastic cynic side of life; depicted within the High School era, but relevant to all age groups..funny at times, too"
"Daria may be a misfit but she is a very smart teenager. In addition, she has a great sense of humor."
I started watching this series on cable. Caustic social commentary and biting humor. Over the top! Worth a watch! It's that good.
"I like this. It is like Awkward, which I really like. I am not in school, and haven't been in decades. However, people and places never change, and I can relate!"
"She is so funny! I giggle every episode from her snide comments we all want to make. If you grew up with clueless yuppie parents, this your show!!!"
"If you used to watch Daria, then you will love owning this as well. My family used to tape the show and quote it extensively, but I didn't realize I could actually own it. On my recent birthday I wondered what I could buy that would make me the happiest, thought of Daria and did a search for it. I was pleased to find it on amazon.com."
"Sometimes you rewatch a show you liked when you were a teenager and you question the taste of your younger self. Not so with this show.Watching the show as an adult is a very different experience (I get all the jokes now, for one), and I'm very glad I decided to try it out. &#34;Daria&#34; is just as funny as it was when it was airing, but now it has an added air of nostalgia - the good kind, where you get to relive all the things you loved (and loved to hate) about the 90s in easily digestible 20ish minute chunks."
"I so loved the first season of Daria. Refreshingly nihilistic and amoral, this classic MTV animated series from the 1990s represented a truly wonderful break from the saccharine pap we're usually fed. It offered us a take on high school life light years away from the idealised vision to be found in so many shows. What we have here is considerably closer to the brutal - and just plain stupid - reality. What's more, ""Daria"" is a show that manages to pull all this off with a dry, rapier wit, and its own tersely ironic sense of style.I know that five star reviews tend to predominate here on Amazon. So much so that it becomes almost a running joke. I think that's because according to Amazon's stated guidelines, five stars simply means ""I love it!"", and most folks tend to review what they love. But in all honesty, this really is an extraordinarily good piece of animation. One well worthy of five stars by just about any criteria.As  is the case with any TV show transferred to other formats, it needs to be acknowledged that there are really two issues here: the show itself and the transfer. As most readers will already know, with Daria the big issue with the transfer was always going to be the music. Because the original show sampled from so many popular artists, a full and faithful reproduction on a non-bootlegged release was always going to be a copyright impossibility. In the end, virtually none of the original background music survived.Given this reality, for the most part I take off my hat to the musicians who did end up providing the substitute background music. They took on what was always going to be a thankless task and for the most part acquitted themselves pretty well. True, there are moments here and there where the music they provide is noticeably weaker than what we heard in the TV original. But overall they do a fairly solid job. Personally, what I miss most is not the lost background music per se, but the varied and eclectic range of songs used as end title music in the original broadcasts. These often provided an ironic or poignant counterpoint to the themes explored in the episode.The music aside, in my opinion the first two seasons, and the very first season in particular, really do see Daria at her best. Thereafter... things begin to go downhill. Slowly and intermittently at first, but by progressively greater leaps and bounds. The most marked change is that Daria the sardonic observer of human folly is replaced by Daria the moral crusader. The show's dry edge isn't entirely lost, but it is substantially dulled. So if you want to want to catch a great show at its absolute best, this is definitely the place you want to be.Theo."
This is a favorite of mine from years past that I still enjoy.  It makes me laugh a lot and I enjoy it.  I don't really usually watch cartoons after raising my children but this a great show.
"Best TV Series I have ever watched. Great acting. Not for the timid. Lots of foul language, sex, nudity, and brutality."
This series is one of the best series produced for television. It is ground breaking on so many levels it is worth seeing more than once.. I strongly recommend watching ALL of the seasons.. You will be engaged and entertained.
"Great last season. The finale was disappointing, but I already knew that it was going to end that way due to spoilers. other then that it was a great series and i recommend it to anyone."
"This was the final season and a good season it was.  Personalities died and others emerged.  The show started the way it ended, with Tony in therapy (w/Carmella), Meadow, her usual brilliant self, truly growing into daddy's little girl, becoming a lawyer as a result of all the stuff she saw growing up, voicing her very strong beliefs.  Tony Jr., well, he lived up to the potential of uber rich New Jersey kids, dumped  the brown GF and took a BMW and an easy trail to his dreams.  Tony was facing another potential indictment, his solution, take the family to a dinner.In the end you could make him out to be a gangster, or just a guy providing for his family in the best way he knew how."
I'm so glad I can &#34;binge watch&#34; every season of the Sopranos on Amazon.  I missed many of the original episodes and it's like a homecoming to get back into the complex story line.  Still one of the best shows on TV.  Ever.
"The writing, the acting, the sets, the outfits, the music.The actors had the accent down.The whole thing was done so well that I was sorry when it was over.A great show, and I can only wonder what other gems James Gandolfini would had come up with had he lived a longer life."
"Madonn!  What a way to go!  Time to Say so long to a certain cable company's saga of an Italian-American Family neck deep in a certain Subculture. It'sSeason 6- The final 21.As we reach this TV milestone let's review what we've learned from the Sopranos:  the Family comes first, never break a soldier's oath, beware of Cousins from Italy, a little therapy never hurts (just don't deface your therapist's magazines), the Don't-ask-Don't tell policy works best for mob wives and goomars, you don't have to eat every dish of Rigatoni, e.g. don't sleep with the Boss' ex-mistress, 'Made men' shouldn't play competitive Monopoly and absolutely do not be a Rat!An amazing final season for one of TV's all-time finest! The Saga of Jersey crime fam comes to a close as  Tony borders on life and death after season opener. Anthony Jr. Struggles with the burden of avenging his father and begins to go to dark places as the season progresses. Johnny gets a prison day-pass for his daughter's wedding just long enough to lose all street cred. Artie and the restaurant are struggling.  Paulie learns he isn't who who he thought he was and Vito, is outted, goes into hiding in New Hampshire. ER's Julianna Margulies briefly joins the cast as goomar and enabler to Chris, who continues his Hollywood pursuits as his Mobster/Horror film Cleaver is final released ...&#34;F' Ben Kingsley. Danny Baldwin took 'em to F'n actin'school.&#34;Uncle Junior has been committed, begins running a game there and has other troubles fitting in at 'the home.' Phil Leotardo, now running Brooklyn in Johnny's stead, continues to break balls & press Tony's buttons but still has time to talk to Vito Junior leading to Tony doing some counseling of his own. Tony must deal with his lack of remorse over his part in the death of another friend. All this and the Feds are hot to nail Tony's gang, but not as hot as the Brooklyn gang. It's all come down to this, measures are taken... mistakes are made... a blood bath ensues.. Seriously.There are no weak stories this season. &#34;Join the Club&#34; & &#34;Mayham&#34; are two amazing episodes, mid-season closer Kaisha is terrific. Mid-season opener &#34;Soprano Home Movies&#34; was excellent.  &#34;Stage 5&#34; is  Johnny Sack heavy but good, This season Anthony Jr Blanca/collage/therapy arc is over heavy but it's mercifully Meadow light (and then she's only cheering A.J. up, but at least it's not moaning about Finn). &#34;Remember When&#34; are &#34;Walk like a man&#34; are solid. &#34;Kennedy & Heidi&#34; is a terrific ep when the asbestos hits the fan and Tony goes on a Vegas vision quest. In &#34;Second Coming&#34; there's more than one scene that will make even tough guys cringe, but the Sopranos never shies from showing the violence. &#34;Blue Comet&#34; has some of the most stylistic executions of the entire series.  In spite of all internet debate on the subject &#34;Made in America&#34; is an ok closer for the series run.The throwaway line at the Cleaver Film premiere: &#34;The Sacred & the Propane&#34; ... Exemplifies the series itself high crime drama opposite the darkly funny. As my 15th anniversary re-screening comes to a close I gotta say the series, as a whole, has aged well like a fine italian wine... It means what it means."
I finally got around to watching this series an really enjoyed it.  The acting was superb and the story line fascinating.
One of the best seasons of one of the best TV series ever. Love that the entire series is now available through Amazon Prime.
"This series in quality was up there among the best in T.V. programs and films made for the big screen.  But there was one thing that I found annoying.  This series must lead the pack in product placements. The view of Kellogg's, Ford, and many other product logos  was thrust into the viewer's face multiple times.  Did this technique make me want to run out and buy the product being pushed?  I think not. I quit watching commercial network television almost five years ago due to the number of commercials per segment, and the number of commercial segments per hour. Although there is really nothing I can do to avoid seeing the placements, I can let the manufacturer know that I find the ads leave me with a negative impression of that product by forcing the ad on me.  Unlike ads in newspapers and magazines I can't just look away and ignore the ad. When possible I purchase an item of similar utility from another seller."
I have seen the Complete series a couple of times.  Every couple of years or so.  It's a Great Show.  But the ending is just Crap. It was a Very Controversial ending.
"We do not get HBO, so I streamed through our Roku box,  also from Amazon.  Not much to say it was a wonderfull series."
I n season 6 all of the actors showed there true ability to out perform in a dynamic show like the Sopranos.
"I found this show to be completely captivating.  We all become psychoanalysts watching this, you can't help but pick apart the psychology of the women involved.  One feels horribly sorry for most of these women, who are so insecure and desperate that they go looking for prisoners to marry, only to be horribly taken advantage of, almost every time.  All the excuses they make for themselves and how they're different... how you can't help who you fall in love with (yeah, right!)... fascinating stuff.  I wish there was a season two."
I find it amazing how these women sacrifice their lives for these men that are in for the long haul.  They must have very low opinion of themselves or don't like to have to answer to someone everyday at home.
Prison wives sheds light on the other half of a prison sentence. My wife and I both enjoyed watching every episode in this series. These women take commitment to a whole other level.
"This show is for you if you have an open mind. Some of the women you can relate to in some way or another. But some women can be a little out there. Not because they married who they did....but because some have issues. But there are some women who got it together, jobs, family they just....well like the saying goes sometimes you can't help who you fall in love with!!!!!"
I love how this show is realistic with today's family issues. Every time I watch an episode I feel inspired and happy. Love this series.
"Season 3 of PARENTHOOD will be airing in the fall and season 2 will be released on dvd later this month.  Here we have the 13 episodes that made up the first season, our beloved introduction into PARENTHOOD.  This truly is an amazing series with superb acting and writing that is much needed on tv right now.  It has been a very long time since there was a realistic drama on tv about a true and realistic middle-class family.  This show is based on real situations that normal people deal with.  It is also based on the unity of family and unconditional love.  The pilot episode tried to jam all the characters in and was a little muddled but episode 2 smoothed everything down and the show got into a groove.  The talent involved in this ensemble cast is immense with the standouts being the superb Lauren Graham and Peter Krause.  They are both known for tv series and here they in no way resemble previous roles.  Lauren in particular.  She again plays a single mother but her character and performance in no way resembles Lorelai Gilmore.  Dax Shepard also rises to the plate here.  Many know him for comedy but he creates a great character here.Invest your time into this amazing show that is PARENTHOOD.  You will get to know characters worth knowing who are facing life situations the same as you.  You will laugh, you will cry and most of all you will identify.  This season wiull definitely impress but then you must move on to season 2 where the series truly shines.  PARENTHOOD is amazing and I highly recommend it."
"I really enjoy Parenthood.I didn't get into it, the first time, until it was in its second season, when someone told me that one of the characters had Asperger's. Since I have mild Asperger's, that caught my attention, so I started watching whenever I could. (Unfortunately, I was sharing a TV set for several years, so I didn't get to watch every episode.)With Amazon Prime, I'm watching every episode in order, and I love it.I wasn't diagnosed with Asperger's until I was in my 40's, but I can sympathize with the parents, and wonder how exasperated they were with me as a kid, not knowing what I had. Like Max, I often insisted on having the final word, and I did get upset when other people didn't follow the rules.While I may not have refused to quit a game until I won, my brother and sister got to the point that they refused to play games with me.I'm glad that Max's parents don't hit him in frustration, like mine sometimes hit me.I highly recommend Parenthood, and would give it five hundred stars if I could.John"
"I thoroughly enjoy &#34;Parenthood&#34;.  The family deals with so many issues, the least of which is the size of it and the emotional closeness of it's members.  Sounds like a cliche, but &#34;I laughed; I cried!&#34;.  It is wonderful, with a superb ensemble cast and crack writing.  It is upbeat, but not sugar-coated.  It's about survival, and the support system that helps them endure as a family."
"In the 90's there were a hundred family drama's. Then in the 2000's we started coming out with the new aged drama's but drama along was never enough. Everyone had to be doctor's or family had to be running for office, people had to sell drugs or some other crud. All of those shows while good, focused more on topics that don't relate to the everyday person. Enter Parenthood. A show I avoided watching just because I hated Six Feet Under so much and Peter Krause was in that show as well.Having watched both Season's 1 and 2 I can't name another ""regular"" television show I like more. While sure I love Game of Thrones and Dexter. Breaking Bad entertains me but it's not very relatable to the common person.Again, Parenthood is perfect. I don't feel is strongly about the show as another reviewer who said, ""If this show goes off the air I will literally no longer exist."" But, I can say I really really like the show. I'd be said, but I'd go on."
"""Parenthood, Season One"". . . .I had started watching ""Parenthood"" when it first broadcast in 2010, but got distracted by another show - ""The Wire,"" perhaps? - and it fell off my radar after the first few weeks. Recently while hitting a lull in my binge-watching, I heard a glowing review on NPR of the series, which praised the ensemble cast and mentioned that the series had been created by producer Jason Katims, who was also the creative force behind the ""Friday Night Lights"" series. That got my attention.  So, I decided to go for it, and delve into ""Parenthood"" as well.Having just finished Season 1-3, I am definitely hooked, though there are a few minor details that keep getting in the way.The show is generally pretty strong... Although new plot elements are sometimes introduced with a slightly forced feel (""Haddie will now have a black boyfriend. Amber will develop an Attitude Problem."") and are often dropped rather quickly (""Things are OK now."") Probably this is more a reflection of the difference between writing for a weekly TV audience, as opposed to viewers who binge-watch entire seasons on DVD - three weeks as opposed to three hours makes a big difference in how story arcs play out, and whether they ""feel real"" or not.Overall, though, the show is remarkable for its depth and honesty in exploring an amazing range of topics, showing a frankness about the difficulties of parenting, of negotiating sexuality and romance at a variety of ages, and about mental health and disability issues such as substance abuse and autism, all dealt with with a frankness that is surprising for network TV.  Even with its occasional dramatic flaws, the show has a profound authenticity: like many viewers, my wife and I often found ourselves nodding and saying, ""yep! that happened to us!""A universal theme among the large cast is of discovering and re-shaping one's identity, an issue that comes up at every age on a variety of fronts: teenagers test boundaries and take risks, parents set boundaries and often make mistakes, retired couples find that old issues still need to be ironed out, and can put even seemingly rock-solid relationships at risk. For each character new choices come up constantly, challenging established self-images and social roles. The ramifications of ""parenthood"" are explored in every generation, on a variety of levels: the youngest children innocently mirror their parents while teenage siblings are constantly in conflict with these same parents and struggle to establish their own autonomy, while the four grown-up siblings in the Braverman family are perpetually tested by parental responsibilities, and even by their relationships to their own parents. Meanwhile, Grandma and Grandpa have their own roles to play for all these children and grandchildren, and even their own issues with their own parents. (In one poignant episode, the family patriarch, played by Craig T. Nelson, agonizes about his need to connect emotionally with his own distant, disapproving 86-year old mother: it never stops, really.)My criticisms mostly have to do with the show's choice of locale: supposedly this is all taking place in Berkeley, California, a city I am quite familiar with. Why Jason Katims decided to place the show there is a little mysterious, given his apparent lack of knowledge about the town. To start with, ""Parenthood"" is constantly geographically challenged when it comes to Berkeley and the Bay Area: one night the teenagers sneak out to go to a fraternity party ""across the Bay,"" which is ridiculous, since all the frat houses are here in Berkeley, not in SF or Marin. Likewise in another early episode, one kids' parents have to drive to Fremont (which is like fifteen miles away, all horrible freeway driving) to pick up a birthday cake, which is nuts since there are dozens of great bakeries in Berkeley itself, a town that is possibly the food snob capitol of America. (The long drive was just a plot device to get the parents out of the party scenes...) Visually it's all wrong as well: the show is not actually filmed in Berkeley, and characters frequently refer to locations that don't exist, such as ""the corner of College and 8th"" while exterior shots -- street scenes, houses -- almost always look like LA. (On occasion you can spot LA landmarks in the background, such as the Caioti pizza restaurant in Laurel Village... Likewise, there are frequent scenes of busy intersections with strip-mall backgrounds that you simply don't see in NIMBY-centric, no-growth Berkeley.)Of course, that's all small-ball nitpicking to most viewers - the differences between urban planning in Northern California vs. Southern California don't mean much to viewers in Iowa, but the show also has a big problem thematically. ""Berkeley"" is often used as a pop-culture shorthand for something ""weird"" or alterna and totally out of the mainstream, for ethnic diversity and political activism.  But there is very little in ""Parenthood"" that merits such a distinction. Yeah, there are two interracial couples and one family has a kid with Aspergers, but it's not like that stuff isn't happening pretty much everywhere in America anyway.Meanwhile, in supposedly wacky, alterna Berkeley, we see practically no people of color other than the two African-American love interests. A couple of Asian-Americans have cameos as teachers or school parents, one Latino guy who works in a warehouse semi-dates one of the Braverman sisters, but vanishes after a couple of episodes. In Season Three we finally have one Latina woman with depth emerge - a pregnant, working-class teenager who offers to let one of the couples adopt her baby -- but her character is semi-stereotyped and meanwhile no Latinos or Asian-American professionals seem to be in the Braverman orbit. Really? This big, hip Berkeley family and they don't have *any* friends who are people of color, other than the two black people they fall in love with? For real?Of these two love interests, the character of Jasmine, played by Joy Bryant, is by far the strongest: she emerges as a fully-formed, multi-dimensional person, fluent and comfortable in both ""black"" and ""white"" culture, and seems like a completely authentic, realistic, contemporary Bay Area person. Jasmine exists as an unapologetic equal to the other characters in the predominantly white cast and she's never given any stupid, forced, stereotypical issues that revolve around her race -- she doesn't preach about race issues, she doesn't have a drug problem or a chip on her shoulder about anything, she doesn't go through any of the same-old tiresome motions of black-culture-as-seen-by-Hollywood.  It's very refreshing.In contrast, the kid-from-the-hood Alex, as played by Michael B. Jordan (an alumnus of ""Friday Night Lights"") is disappointing. He dates the high-school aged Haddie, and while their courtship provides a foil for the questionable overreactions of Haddie's parents, the relationship goes nowhere. Alex is a big bundle of troubles -- though amazingly polite and a perfect gentleman, he is economically disadvantaged, a recovering alcoholic, and so morally pure and self-sacrificing that he finally breaks up with Haddie rather than drag her down with his own real-world worries, just as she's just starting out on her own life. Their relationship had glimmers of great potential - it would have been so cool if the writers just made it work out, rather than have it turn into some big over-the-top melodrama, but the show's producers weren't able to hit that particular note of restraint. Oh, well.Finally, I have a big, big, big problem with the fact that, having finished the third season, we still haven't seen one single gay or lesbian character on the whole show, not even a random gay parent at any of the public and private schools the various Braverman kids attend. ""Oh, but this is a show about parenting,"" some may say. ""Why would you have gay characters on a show like that?""  Um, hello?  2014 calling. Not all parents are heterosexual. Your show is supposedly set in Berkeley. This is your big chance to ""be Berkeley"": there are nothing BUT gay parents in Berkeley, California. So where are they on ""Parenthood?"" Seriously: WTF?Overall, though, this is an excellent series which explores a wide range of contemporary family issues, and though the orientation is pretty lily-white and upper-ish middle-class, many of the themes are fairly universal and may strike a chord with a wide range of viewers. In particular, the portrayal of Max, an adolescent boy with Asperger's syndrome, is a breakthrough for mainstream television, and may be a comfort to families coping with various kinds of autism or other behavioral spectrum disabilities. Max's diagnosis was a central focus of Season One, and slips in and out of focus in S2 and S3. While the writers could probably hammer it home a little bit more, they don't shy away from the very real and very difficult issues at hand.Producer Jason Katim's child apparently has Aspergers, so there are scene here that will ring true because they are true: I think these may resonate mostly with families that have similar issues. While I understand the impulse to underplay some of the heartbreaking dysfunctions in order to make the show ""play"" better for a mainstream audience, I think ultimately it might be stronger dramatically to show even more of Max's problems. This is particularly true of his outbursts and tantrums, a problem that has more to do with neurology (wiring) than with ""bad parenting"" which is what folks on the outside often think is happening. Still, seeing these issues portrayed realistically on network TV is pretty profound, and remains one of the elements that makes ""Parenthood"" stand out. Also, there are lots of great performances, with my personal favorites being actors Joy Bryant, Bonnie Bedelia, Sam Jaeger, Mae Whitman, Tina Lifford, Max Burkholder and Jason Ritter, pretty much in that order. And Craig T. Russell's performance as the grandad is also a nice surprise. It's a good show - if you're on the fence, check it out. (DJ Joe Sixpack, professional windbag, ReadThatAgain reviews)"
You can see your own family in this show!  Life-like situations we all face when raising and communicating with family and children.
"The talented ensemble cast is essential in keeping the show interesting. The show features the usual hardships of white, middle class life in suburban Berkeley, California. An autistic son, an unplanned pregnancy, divorce, single mother hardship, empty nest divorces. The reason I watch is because I care about the characters. The episodes are poignant and brilliantly acted.The directing and cinematography are very good, particularly for a network television program. The writing is crisp and authentic. Each character has a unique, resounding voice. Flawed and genuine, we keep watching, wishing our family had the kind of resolve the Braverman's have.The abundance of characters allows a smooth shifting between each life, allowing more realistic events to provide entertainment, drama and comedy. Single subject sitcoms, tend to require increasing melodrama to retain viewers. Not so with Parenthood. I can't stop watching."
I have seen in a long while.  This show is a drama but full of feeling and emotion that many of us encounter in our family lives.
This is truly family fare!  Real life problems on the screen!  Recommend for the whole family.  The whole thing is very sweet!
"Unlike so many shows out there ""Parenthood"" gets better and better as the show goes on. If you like shows like Friday Night Lights watch this! If you don't, its still good if you dont like FNL. My wife hates FNL but she loves this show. Parenthood is one of the best acted and beautifully produced shows on TV. The first season starts of slow, but it gets better and better!"
"I love this show. It's raw and it's real. The acting is pure artistry. The show reminds me of how my family use to be when our matriarch was alive and we were a close nit group. The love and loyalty these characters have for one another is incomparable. Refreshing is the season ended beautifully and I am left wanting more of The Braverman clan. Anyone looking for a show that is intelligent, classy , and ripe with adult situation while still being something you can watch while the kids are awake then this is it. And if you come from a big family your going to relate no matter what walk of life you come from. They don't get much better than this."
A great family show. Love all the actors & characters. I really am hooked on this show. Glad I have Amazon Prime.
"I thoroughly enjoyed this show.  Enjoyed the Braverman family.  A must to see.I saw all 4 seasons and hope there will be a Season 5.  Season 4 was a tear jerker, but so real and the acting was excellent.  I am going to watch it again....you just fall in love with the Braverman family.  They are a close knit family even though every family member have issues....loved the tv show.  Hope it will return with a season 5.  Fell in love with Max, and loved Kristina, Crosby and Jasmine, Adam is great, all the actors and in their roles was simply wonderful....."
I purchased this after watching a couple of episodes on Television thinking that it might just be OK to watch during the Summer months when nothing much is on (Australian Summer).  What a surprise I received - this is an excellent programme - better than most.  The casting is right on the money.  The storylines while being real and honest still manage to include humour.  The only thing wrong with this series is that there are only thirteen episodes.  I will be counting down the days until the next series is released and I am hoping that the show is extended to twenty two episodes.
"This is a remarkable show about a family and their families, they touch on everything in life, love pain everything."
Another netflix show that got me to buying the seasons! I didn't think I would like it but I love it! I can't wait til the 4th season and Netflix gets that!
"love it. bring some tissues, makes me wife cry every other episode. it's funny too, and endearing. need more word"
"This show is about a large close-knit extended family constantly spending time together and dealing with the crisis's of everyday life, and absolutely NOBODY can keep a secret.  They mostly seem to be in hectic stress mode and the show is highly emotional.  BUT you like these characters and invest in them quickly and are thus willing and eager to share their joy and pain and all the garbage that is part of life.  There are also some good examples of a good marriage in this show - which is GREAT as so few of us get good role models there in real life.Craig T. Nelson is the father of 2 sons and 2 daughters, and he and his wife are hiding marital problems from their kids. The eldest son has a wife, a teenage daughter and a young son with Asperger syndrome (sort of a high functioning autism) and is highly depended upon by everyone to be ""the fixer"" in every situation, the other son is single and something of a commitment phobe who just discovered he has a 5-yr old son he never knew about (who by the way is a really adorable kid), Lauren Graham plays the older daughter who at age 38 returns home to live with her parents and start life over after having divorced her musician/junkie husband - with 2 semi-delinquent teenage kids in tow (a son and a daughter), and the other daughter is a lawyer trying to squeeze in some ""mom"" time with her daughter and her husband is the perfect handsome who gave up contracting/construction work to be a perfect stay-at-home dad to their little girl.The whole cast is fantastic and the show absolutely holds your attention. (And I am thankful to have another series to watch the incredible Lauren Graham in!)I didn't get to see this show on TV, so I was thrilled to be able to watch it on Amazon Prime (pretty much back to back and minus commercials!)  This show is a great dramatic series!"
"I was looking for a comedy series and started watching Parenthood on Prime.  WOW... got sucked in and have been watching show after show.  the acting is outstanding, writing is amazing, realistic, not like a laugh track sitcom.  The comedy is subtle... sometimes just glances or a raised eyebrow, but really funny.  This show is more like a drama with the comedy suffused through it that life always provides. The families are loving and sweet and quirky and dysfunctional all at the same time.  Warning, if you're a big conservative, give this a pass... there are mixed race families, drug use by teens, etc, etc... just like in real life."
"You are immediately sucked into loving the characters. This family will remind you of your own family...the smart caring son who is raising a child with autism, the 40 something daughter who has sacrificed her dreams for her ROCK STAR husband and is now raising 2 teens alone, the smart sister who has a great job and a stay at home dad, and the screw-up brother who is always messing up. If it doesn't remind you of your own family, you will be wishing you had a family like it. Great characters with real life day-to-day struggles. Best family show since Party of 5."
"I usually don't like these types of soap opera-ish shows, but we tried it and i think it's one of the best shows on the air. Funny and dramatic, without being melodramatic is rare and often a failure; but they pull this off with style. The characters, of which there are a multitude are so well crafted that their similarities become melded into a casting that demands each get its time to develop and interact in a fashion that can only be discribed as growth; like a real person grows within a family, and like a family grows together and apart. It's real lofe on television; not some concoted formula of what works and what people want to see."
"When Parenthood first came out, I wanted to watch, but real-life got in the way. I had been a fan of other family-centered comedy/dramas of the past (thirtysomething, Once & Again, Gilmore Girls) and had been yearning for something similar for years, something with intelligent writing, great acting, and realistic scenarios. But I watched only some of the pilot and none of the rest of the series. After all, who has time to sit down to an hour-long show these days?When I saw the show pop up on Amazon Prime, I gave it a shot--and I'm so happy I did. This is one of the most intelligent, realistic, and heartwarming shows in a long time. When I finish with one episode, I can't wait to see what happens next.All the actors are terrific, from crotchety Craig T. Nelson to the youngest members of the clan. (Someone did an incredible job with casting!) Every character is well thought out and multidimensional. The writing is so realistic. People talk over one another, there are multiple conversations going on at once--it's even more realistic than some of the so-called reality shows on the air.Parenthood is a real-life drama that's a huge break from real life."
"I think this show is well cast with interesting plots that will intrigue any and all real, everyday parents.  The acting is superb.  The viewer will be happy,  sad,  angry and joyful during these episodes,  just as good tv entertainment should inspire."
I love the way this show successfully carries several plot lines and then will intertwine them at moments and bring all of the characters together. Great show. I wish Amazon would work on their streaming interface though...frustrating to have to add separate seasons to watch.
"If you like crime drama, very good choice.  Good characters.  Very realistic show that I would recoment to anyone that enjoyed this type of show."
"The first season hooked me, even though the final episode was, perhaps, a bit overdone. This season made me a fan. If you enjoy cop dramas, this is certainly one to check out!"
I really like cops shows and Southland has engaging characters along with action.  The internal conflict for the characters is quite good.  Regina King is marvelous.
"I've purchased the first and second season and I'm in love with the show and all the characters!BUT, my problem is now the third season is unavailable for purchase.  Please Help!!"
I am hooked on the series.  Loved the interaction between the officers and the characters of the inner city streets.
"Possibly the best police drama series since &#34;police story&#34;  and &#34;naked city&#34;. Filmed on location in and around LA and using real people along with actors, the show purports to show what goes on during a shift and how it impacts on the life of cops who have problems of their own."
"Great series, too bad there isn't a season 3 set to buy as well. Get this series you won't be disappointed."
Southland is a good crime drama. It makes you feel for the characters.It feels real. Police dramas that tells all sides of the issues are worth watching.
"If you watched the television series The Shield, this is a must see show.  Real life drama! True to life crime fighting."
"The second season picked up right where season 1 left off.  Again, this show was fast moving and never boring.  The actors portrayed their characters very well and drew me into the show liking and disliking the characters as they moved across the screen.  If you like cop shows this is one show to watch."
"Little Bear is one of the best shows for the toddle set. The action is gentle, never too scary, and there's usually a message to be learned. The music and pictures work well together. More importantly, the editing is slow and easy to follow for younger eyes."
This show is perfectly suited toward youngsters who don't need the over stimulation of ridiculous shows like SpongeBob and the ilk.
I have always lived the little bear books so I love this show.  It is very uplifting and I prefer it over some of theory trendy kids shows.  It is timeless.
"My granddaughters love watching little bear every night! They watch season one and season two and would love to watch season three, when it becomes available!"
"Series provides lessons that kids need as they grow up.  Yeah it's talking animals, but the message gets through.  Grand kids are 2 1/2 and I can see the influence it has in making them learn how to deal with and respect others (yeah, my grand kids are pretty smart)"
"My kids absolutely love this show, and to be honest, so do I. I can allow my kids to watch this show with confidence, knowing they are watching a wholesome show."
"This is the one the whole family can enjoy.  The characters are cute, the pace is slow but not insipid and the stories are full of imagination.I'm only upset that Amazon took it out of the free prime viewing library.  My daughter is hooked and now it's no longer available."
"I love how relaxed this show is. No overly loud noises or crazy plot points. It's a very gentle show, and my kids are more docile after they watch it. Always a plus."
My kids enjoy watching this show when they're feeling cruddy with a cold- the stories are sweet! Not hard for me to sit through either :)
Wholesome and imaginative catroon for the children and adults alike. My daughters love to watch as Little Bear has adventures with his friends.
My children enjoyed these video very much.  The videos are very entertaining and educational.  The lenght of the video is perfect.
A very nice show for young children to watch.  My three year old loves these shows and it is so much better than some of the programs out there today.
"Little Bear and his friends - Owl, Duck, Cat, etc. are lovable and cute - the stories are engaging and make for fun viewing for little ones. Little Bear is one those kids' shows that you don't feel guilty letting your young child watch - it has good language, endearing characters that appeal to young children, and good production values without over-loud music and garish colors.The language is clean, and the characters, i.e. Little Bear and friends, are truly endearing. My first-grader loved watching the episodes when she was three. This is a good production for young children. Highly recommended!"
"THE ECLIPSE is mostly a romantic story, infused w/ supernatural happenings and a few jolts here and there. Michael Farr (Ciaran Hinds) is a widower w/ two children, haunted by his wife's death. He falls in love w/ a woman who writes ghost stories, and must deal w/ inner conflict along w/ his aging father in law. Throw in Aidan Quinn as a lecherous, drunken ex-lover of Michael's new love interest, and you've got quite a mess! Along the way, Michael is tormented by spectres, both in dreams and in reality. This is a quiet, somber little film, w/ no noisy, CGI ghosts or Hollywood thrills. It's an Irish movie that moves at a pace that will probably infuriate and bewilder most action-starved, explosion-addicted Americans..."
"It is not typical horror movie and about horror , it is a life drama , story about ""let go "" from the past and present , interesting movie, there was moments that scared me as well as they was unexpected but the meaning of that you should understand when you finish watching the movie . It is not easy if you have no experiences , but for those that know how it feel to lose someone it could be clear what the movie was about."
"Well, the grand children gave it their seal of approval.  Only thing that equals it is Dora.  Now my grand daughter says she is Dora, and her brother is Diego.  Good, well rounded and kid friendly."
Diego is a teaching tool for my 4 year old granddaughter. She has watched every episode and repeats much of the stories to me.
"My 2 1/2 yr old granddaughter loves to wind down with Diego and his friends after some energetic play.  It meets my requirements as it is about something (saving animals and other creatures), encourages use of other languages and is fun, so it isn't just amusement, but educational."
"My little one absolutely loves Diego, she has all the stuffed characters and she watches on my iPad while on my lap. We talk about the animals and she is only 2, but answers all questions and follows along with whatever Diego asks her to do. Good learning tool."
"Again, to add to my recent review, Diego has been a great series for my 21-month-old daughter to enjoy and from which to apply knowledge learned to the world around her!"
My four year old grandbaby absolutely loves Diego.  She can't get enough and learns well from the format.  Well done.
"I purchased the Go, Diego, Go! series for my granddaughter!  She watches it on our Kindle, and is very interactive with the stories.  As a toddler, she learns  problem solving skills, names of many animals, compassion for them as well.  She simply enjoys the music, action, and the vivid colors.  Go, Diego Go! is not only entertainment for your little ones, it's a learning process as well.  I would recommend it to all parents, grandparents who are looking for something special for their children! A thumbs up!!!"
"Not preachy, but, family oriented.  Gives examples of family love with some morality and fun.  Recommended to families, and those looking for good story lines without worry about language issues."
"I LOVE this series! Great visuals and bright colors really engage.I admire that this series portrays a loving family with strong adults as role models, no kids &#34;pulling the wool over the adults eyes&#34; and no sass allowed! A delight for Mom and Dad to watch too!"
"My 14 yr old granddaughter loved this when she was younger and was very excited to watch the very first episode ever. Now my 8 year old is getting into it. It's a good story for kids, where the good guys are actually respectful to grown ups. Love it."
"When he's sees Little Bill up on the Amazon screen he's always excited to watch it.  I'm not sure why, but it is pretty enjoyable and funny to him.  My four year old daughter doesn't seem to have an opinion, but still likes to watch it with him."
Little ones can associate well with the day to day fun and problems. It helps them figure things out. Like remember little bill did that
this show teaches kids so much.  its great fun at home and in school and the generations of family are wonderful
"Little Bill is a wonderful show for learning about life, in general, from a young child's perspective.  Having a 3-generational family makes the show very interesting, but the bigger attraction is that the show addresses a 'cross-section' of the U.S./or the world.  The children and families are of varying ethnic backgrounds...something most U.S. based shows lack altogether.  It is culturally sensitive and doesn't dwell upon children who have an 'abundance.'  It is creative, easy to understand and fun.  And absolutely no violence...quite true to Bill Cosby style.  I would recommend this to any child of any background anwhere!  I wish Amazon would offer the entire series, it would be a great thing option for families such as mine that are in search of these kinds of shows for our little ones."
"Wonderful stories from a child's perspective. I like how Little Bill has supportive relationships with children and adults. Little Bill has a good friend who happens to have Cerebral Palsy and is wheelchair bound. The stories deal openly and compassionately with common issues that arise around those with special needs (helping vs. making someone feel babied). Adults (teacher, parents, grandparents) are depicted as helpful and wise allies. There are episodes that show sibling rivalry, competitiveness, and ways they resolve hurt feelings. The voice of Little Bill does remind me of Bill Cosby's standup and mention of his own childhood."
Another hit.  I'm glad something of Bill Cosby's is around for my children to enjoy.  Our 3 y/o especially enjoys the &#34;Captain Brainstorm&#34; episode.
We love watching these and I love how their is a bit of adult/parent humor. &#34;Why are you fixing the bike?&#34;  &#34;Because the only thing your father can fix is a sandwich.&#34; Classic. Instant love. I really like that it helps teach the kids about diversity too.
"Little Bill continues to exemplify what a good, educational children's program should be. I only wish that it was still running."
Little Bill is a family favorite. The program centers around Little Bill and his daily adventures. There are good lessons big and small to be learned and they're not all by Little Bill as may be the case for other shows. All family members and friends are involved.
all episodes and all seasons are total enjoyment teaching kids about so many of life's little lessons.  your kids will love it
"another favorite of my grandson. he loves little bill, it is perfect for  2 year old, with a limited attention span, not so many words, great for a quick story to finish with in a few min."
"Little Bill is fun for a wide variety of ages.  I have two grandchildren ages 5 and 7, one boy, one girl, and they both like Little Bill."
My 3 year old loves this show and often sings the songs. I love the lessons and multi-cultural and ethnic characters.
"I only just noticed that Season 2 of Little Bill was available, and immediately watched it (this time, my son wanted it...in a few months time he will be 4 years old).  In my opinion this show continues to be the best &#34;TV&#34; program for my son...I'm thrilled that Bill Cosby created this very warm, family-friendly, non-commercial, and ofcourse, non-violent series for young children.  At this stage of my young son's life, everything is a teacher...he is a sponge, soaking in all to which he is exposed.  No better teacher than the the &#34;real - life lessons&#34; offered in Little Bill.  The only difference that I note in Season 2 is that its somehow 'already familiar,' the episodes are all different but the novelty of being a first encounter has changed.  However, that does not take away from the quality of the show."
"This is a favorite of my daughter.  Just like on TV, she is hooked and it keeps her entertained with a responsible and well-produced show.  We watch on the Kindles Fire HD"
"Love this show.  It shows positive ways to solve problems and learn from them. Really wonderful interaction  and realationships with family and friends. All the drama and dysfunction in most families could take a lesson from this show. It is wonderful to see a close, loving family that interacts respectfully to one another . Very healthy and realistic. Great values. One of my favorites. Thanks Bill Cosby."
"The other streaming Net service has removed some great kids' shows lately, and to my knowledge never had Little Bill to begin with, so it's a treat to find it here."
"General Pang Qing Yun is the sole survivor of his entire battalion. The Ching army was taken out against Taiping rebels in Hechuan. A woman named Lian spends the night with Pang and leaves before he wakes the next morning. Jiang Wuyang, one of the bandits that rides into the town Pang currently finds himself in, is impressed with Pang's fighting skills and introduces Pang to Zhao Er Hu. Jiang and Er Hu take Pang to their village where Pang is reunited with Lian who just so happens to be Er Hu's wife. The bandits from the village overthrow a passing food convoy and that is thought to be a resolution to their current desperation until the imperial army invades and usurps the food that they stole. Pang, Er Hu, and Jiang take a blood oath to become blood brothers before joining Lord Chen's army. With the odds against them, their 800 soldiers get the upper hand on Shu City's 5,000 as plans are put into motion to overthrow Suzhou and Nanjing, the capital. The brothers soon begin to fall apart on their rise to the top. Er Hu tends to be loyal with his word and his brothers no matter what as Pang will sacrifice anyone and even make deals with his enemies just to win while Jiang is stuck in the middle.This movie is phenomenal. The battle sequences are stunning, the cinematography is brilliant, and the acting is top notch. The Warlords took everything that was fantastic about Mongol and made it just a little bit better. Jet Li deserves a mention. After seeing Unleashed and Fearless, it was nice to see him actually show his acting chops again. The desire to see him at that acting capacity was high, so it was quite a treat to see him at that caliber once again. After The Forbidden Kingdom and his rather stale performance in that, it's become a bit difficult what to expect from him other than him displaying how talented he is at martial arts. Fortunately, he did a great job in this as he showed just about every emotion in this film at some time or another. His fight scenes were also incredible, but that is kind of a given. Andy Lau also deserves a nod. His character is just so passionate about being honorable and loyal that when things go wrong, his reaction is just explosive. He has some really powerful scenes where he's fighting for what he thinks is right. There's a scene where a play is mocking him and his brothers while he's eating dinner. He begins to laugh, which leads to him crying uncontrollably, and then he begins laughing again. He just managed to pull it off flawlessly and it was incredibly impressive.The battle scenes didn't pull any punches either. Blood flies across the screen as limbs roll on the ground. It's truly fantastic. They are the highlight of the film as the first half seems to not pull away from the battlefield. The film is also extremely colorful. Every scene is stunningly vibrant. There are so many memorable scenes from the film and half of that is due to how they were shot. There's a scene where Er Hu runs into a coliseum where there are just hundreds of dead bodies lying on the ground and the camera does a 360 degree motion around him capturing his emotions and the devastation that lies around him. It's amazing.The Warlords is one of the best Chinese war epics I've ever seen. Not that I've seen too many of them, but even in comparison to feudal Japan films, it's one of the best.  If you were a fan of films like Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Kahn, The Last Samurai, or Seven Samurai, then this comes highly recommended. It's the type of film that shouldn't be missed by anyone."
"great performance by Jet Li and the entire cast. the story is basically you love triangle set during chinese feudal wars. and as always, the woman is given all the blame for screwing up the &#34;brotherhood&#34;"
"Jet Li as a villain is quite a remarkable piece of casting, and everyone really holds their own in this action epic set in 1860s China. The title in English is Warlords but in Chinese it was Blood Brothers, and features three men who are doing their best to survive in a wartorn land.Jet Li, a great general in the Imperial army, is betrayed and the only man in his army to survive. His resurrection from the dead is both fascinating and appalling to watch as his desire for power obliterates all before him. Andy Lau gives the performance of a lifetime as the head of a band of brigands, who first follows Jet Li but later becomes disaffected by what he sees and tries to turn back from the collision course the ambitious general has set them all on.Takeshi Kaneshiro as the youngest of the three strong male leads is remarkable in terms of both his battle prowess and how loyal he is to both men, until he is forced to choose sides. Complicating matters still further is the fact that Li's character unintentionally fell in love with a woman on the road, who turns out to be the wife of Lau's character. The inevitable ending is anything but as each man meets his fate.The action and battle sequences, music, costume, and above all, the depiction of warfare at the time, including trench warfare, makes this an Asian All Quiet on the Western Front, where there is no glory for anyone, only more bloodshed for the sake of ruthless territorial ambitions.  I have watched it several times now, with a variety of friends, and everyone LOVED it, even as they were completely shocked by it. If you like action films, there is plenty to recommend Warlords, but the sheer depth of this epic is remarkable.  This is a GREAT film in the true sense of the word."
"The Warlords is an amazing film. The story is filled with epic war scenes and dramatic scenes of betrayal, especially towards the magnificent ending. Also, the whole film is shot beautifully. The music is epic and matches the film. Jet Li does a wonderful job and so does the rest of the cast. Everything about this film is powerful and holds a strong message. Sadly, the 1hr 50min Magnet version is the cut version, which is the one I saw. Yet, it was still a stunning movie. I look forward to watching the full version, though.The Warlords has violent war scenes throughout, with blood and gore. There is no notable nudity or sex. Warlords is a must-watch movie and I highly recommend it. (available on Netflix Streaming as of 6/22/12 if you're still unsure and want to save some money)"
"Okay, like the title says. The Grand Children love the Movie. I have to admit, I loved it to. Get it for the entire family and I bet you'll like it to."
"this set of dvd's was a gift for a friend overseas,i'm sure they are going to be disappointed that the series was cancelled"
I had forgotten how great this show was. I start watching this show when it first came on. Then because of work and other stuff I missed the last 3 seasons.
The continuing saga of a socially inept marshal holds my interest and is worthwhile entertainment. Interesting characters in captivating situations.
Great service arrived before the pre-determined time and in the condition promised did not have any issues and did not contact the retailer
We Binged watched this whole series from year 1 through year 4.5. Really loved the writing and the actors. Almost addictive and just wish it had managed to keep going a few more years...as into at least 7 full years. But it is what it was and that was very very good the whole show went out on top and in good standing. But like a good book when it's over it's over. Onto find something else. We don't get cable/satelite so rely on the DVD's and great reviewers from fans here on Amazon to figure out what we might like and enjoy. Someone reviewing The Closer mentioned this show and so glad I took their suggestion up. I can't recommend one season over the other as they were all just great and pretty much as good across the board. It was a bit disconcerning when the younger females kept going through pregnancies and their figures changed considerably but the show handled it well and really todays world they pretty much go with the flow and except for some creative shots and clothing aimed not to point it out they do pretty good. I'll miss Mary and her side kick and glad they didn't ever put them together...good for the writers and directors and makers of this show.
Mary McCormick and Fred Weller are excellent together.  The story lines are captivating and easily holds your interest.  Great series!
"Besides that the story line is not all that new, the approach to it via WitSec was refreshing.  I enjoyed the relationship between Mary and Marshall.  Wish this series would COME BACK!"
"Great Series and I waited expectantly for it every year.  The cast was wonderful and I do miss the series not being on any more, but at least I have the dvds.  Now I can watch to my hearts content."
"Violence, Sex, & some roughly based history, what is not to like about ROME?If you love spear and sandal movies this is one for you, its not as good as the newer Spartacus: Blood and Sand  but it is well worth watching. The story is believable, the acting is good, and there is fun action and adventure in it.As we keep stating; Violence, sex, & some roughly based history, what is not to like about ROME?"
"Awesome show, but does it bother anybody else that most historical shows always have Brits and their accents? Come on, I'd like to see more Americans in shows that are taped, produced and marketed here, call it a plea for the actors I know here. In reality if America is the modern likeness of Rome then it makes much more sense as well. I wonder what the Romans would sound like? Maybe Italian/Greek accent seems feasible. Anyways it's a good show, I just get sick of the whole British thing."
"Because I like both history and historical fiction, I opted to watch this video and I'm very glad I did. Sometimes there was too much violence and sex, but history tells us that those were the two chief components of the Roman Empire. The BBC did an excellent job of presenting the positive side of Roman life as well--architecture, art, public works. The thought went through my mind: it's better to read it than live it. Then came the news broadcasts on TV and I'm wondering just how close we are to actually living it in 2014. Rather scary thought."
Loved it wish there were more seasons...... I like anything that has to do with history ....but in a story type.. I think you learn more ...it was awesome....
"It kind of weird you say to yourself ""I know from history how this is going to end.."" Seeing the events in an emotional context bring new life and interest to those historical facts. In other words you are still surprised when something happens. When the whims of a single man can affect the destiny of the known world or even more interesting how an influential woman might have had that much influence you just want to watch. The production is beautiful and high quality."
I had watched this on cable and missed season 2 for whatever reason. Now I have re-watched season 1 and watched season 2 in a marathon viewing one rainy day boy I really enjoyed this. Sorry there will be no more a shame.
"Bring it back!!! This is the fourth time I've watched it and every time I watch it, it's like the first time! My favorite HBO series period.!"
"The acting was fabulous, the scenery was fantastic, the script was fairly accurate (as best as they could make it) and overall it was a marvelous series. If u are a history buff watch it. If u love action and entertainment watch it. Too bad they cancelled it. But they always do don't they."
"Being a student and author of historical fiction, I must say the British production companies do ""history"" better than anyone else. ""Rome"" is an outstanding production with well done story lines.The writers developed well-known, but rarely published facts about common Roman life; graffiti, treatment of slaves--and the love of blood. The realism is sometimes a bit ""raw""--but accurate historically. Greeks loved beauty--Romans loved blood.The casting is excellent and the props superb! I first noticed Max Pirkis in ""Master and Commander"" (One of my favorite movies) and think the boy has a lot of talent. He is growing into adult roles well and we will see him in some excellent thought provoking roles--if his parents can protect him from ""Hollywood.""Well done Brits! (American studios should be jealous!)"
"You won't regret this series. A must see, I am starting to watch it again just because I loved it so much."
"I was beyond happy to see this turn up !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was starting to wonder why I even kept amazon prime, I had stopped watching it. I was glad to have a reason to watch it again."
"What do you expect...John Milius ! A terrific series, riveting and compelling. We all know the story, ad nauseum, but this retelling with stunning GFI (CFI ?) effects is wonderful!"
"... as you might expect from Milius. Almost every event has the ring of authenticity, but the sub-plot (the centurion's troubles with his wife and children and his friend, Pullo) sometimes drags the attention away from the historical facts. So too does the approach of telling the story largely through the two women who either profit or lose from the changing circumstances; but it is a splendid job of bringing to robust life men and women who are too often viewed as legends.."
"There are a thousand reviews on here, so I will not reiterate those. This show was cancelled primarily because it was too expensive to produce and you can see this in watching the episodes. The show was so well done in that each element involved was top-notch and everything works. What this show will do for you is illustrate what it was REALLY like to live in these times. As you walk around Rome today and even view the coliseum, the aqueducts and the small area of ruins which are left; you begin to see what this civilization was like. Roman ruins are spread all over the Mediterranean countries and we can see and feel this country's overall reach over its subjects. The Series makes great use of costuming and the military structure upon which the Roman empire was based. This series offers a different overview than you can get reading a book (such as the Rise and Fall) or in watching old Roman Legionnaire films from Hollywood. You might notice the following:*Romans maintained ultimate arrogance in truly believing they were superior to all other indigenous groups and maintained this mindset as a divine right.*Roman 'Civilization' of the time was what we would classify today as Third World.*The entire Roman Empire was based upon the fact that they maintained the most well-trained and ruthless armies in the known world. These thieving armies entered other domains; slaughtered, raped and enslaved the populations with zero remorse.*Slavery was considered 'spoils of war' and held no moral implication. The Roman empire lasted close to one-thousand years and slaves were a 'normal' part of daily life and accepted their stations.*Being before the invention of gunpowder, battles were hand-to-hand and it was considered 'normal' to hack and dismember an enemy to death with zero remorse.*Class divisions existed (as they do today) in the 'very rich' living lives of overt decadence and depravity; and the Peon class barely staying alive.*Economic stability depended upon continuous assault and theft of the economies of neighboring countries with zero remorse.It's difficult to put this in a nutshell, but if you were going to, it would be safe to say that Romans of ancient times were vicious thugs, thieves and murderers of evil intrigue who maintained an arrogant view of the world and the working classes and did whatever they could get away with, no matter what the cost.They were the illustration that 'power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.' And this is illustrated in later history when other factions finally brought them down."
"This bloody, sexually explicit show is more enjoyable than &#34;Deadwood&#34; or &#34;The Sopranos&#34;. Plenty of crime, vice, sex, greed, murder and mayhem, enough to satisfy everybody's bloodlust. And to cap it off the show is well written and fast paced. I watched it when it first came out and loved it. Now I can watch two or three episodes at a sitting and I'm enjoying it even more."
"HBO takes risks, thank goodness, and this series ROME  is a fine example of how far a television project can go toward the movie industry and still maintain interest when broken into weekly installments.  There may be a number of quibbles from Latin scholars and historians as to the veracity of it all, but ROME is not a documentary: ROME is a novel played out in Grand Guignol fashion with a sterling cast and a creative production crew.The action takes place in 52 BC and allows us to understand the power struggles and changes of influence between Pompey Magnus (Kenneth Cranham) who leads the Senate, and Julius Caesar (Ciaran Hinds).  Caesar has returned from his Gallic wars supported by his soldiers such as Lucius Vorenus (Kevin McKidd) and his somewhat unfaithful wife Niobe (Indira Varma) and Lucius' best friend (and philosophically polar opposite) Titus Pullo (Ray Stevenson).  But the populace and Senate have formed other ideas during Caesar's prolonged absence at war and all manner of intrigues surface, are planned, and are plotted.There is a generous (some would say excessive) amount of violence and sex spattered about, but then when in Rome....  Some of the supporting cast are particularly fine: Polly Walker is more beautiful (and more evil) than ever as Atia and other small roles are graciously filled with superb actors.The distractions from the series include the ever-present town crier who periodically catches us up on the history as a media newspaper person in toga.  And the opening credits are animated grafitti that become silly and tiresome.  But the overall production values are first class and the color of the cinematography is some of the finest seen on television.  It is a long song, but it can be taken in digestible pieces.  Well worth viewing for a different view of Rome in all its squalid splendor.  Grady Harp, August 06"
"Note: I saw all 12 episodes of Season I in HD via XFinity On Demand.This television series is, thank God, nothing like Gladiator, which depicted Romans carrying weapons in the Senate, which was strictly proscribed, and Romans wearing tattoos, which they despised on account of the barbarian nations they conquered who did wear them. The series does get some historical details right, and there may be facts which have been fudged up. The performances are first-rate, and the costumes and sets have been well-done.Be Warned: Contains graphic violence, female/male nudity & sexuality (in some episodes) and modern/Roman swear words."
"Rome is more than a series of soldiers, war and fighting.  Rome also presented every day life in the city of the country that rule the world.The series follows two soldiers, Lucius Vorenus (Kevin McKidd) and Titus Pullo (Ray Stevenson).  Vorenus was a senior soldier while Pullo, a strongman with a temper, was your average grunt.  Both liked and respected each other, but in the way of family, often quarreled amongst themselves.Reality is shown by the extras having been trained in military arts ranging from marching to swordsman ship.  Helmet, armor and metal costume elements were handcrafted given even more authenticity to the actors' wardrobes and sets.  Even period fabric of wool, cotton and silk were imported and dyed at the production site."
"I thought that THE SOPRANOS was going to be HBO's greatest show, but it started to become very tedious after the fourth season. Then ROME came along and in just 2 seasons, it made me forget entirely about THE SOPRANOS. This is just a brilliant show filled with great performances, great dialogue, great direction... but this is not your parents' Charlton Heston or Elizabeth Taylor epic. This is a brutal, gritty, vulgar, sexy and realistic portrayal of those who lived in these times as presented to our time.Many deserve accolades for their work insofar as performances are concerned like Ciaran Hinds as the frighteningly human Julius Caesar, James Purefoy as the bawdy Marc Antony, the delicious Polly Walker as Atia, the radiant Kerry Condon as Octavia... but the real accolades go to Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson, as the proud but flawed Lucius Vorenus and the lusty, violent Titus Pullo, respectively. It is their relationship that is at the the core of this show, and as much as the political and emotional intrigue of the series is fascinating, I find myself longing for a show that was just about the relationship and adventures of Vorenus and Pullo. Their friendship has a very mismatched-buddy-cop chemistry, but in a form of entertainment that has exhausted that cliche, it really works between these two. They play off each other wonderfully, and individually, they're terrific. I can only hope that this show will, in the future, be as or more respected and revered as THE SOPRANOS."
"I watched this show when it first came out on H.B.O. and I really liked it. If you like shows about Romans and such, give this show a try. The show follows two family's. One rich and one poor. You really get hooked trying to figure out what will happen to these two family's."
"This is HBO's series ROME,Season One.  I watched the first season buy watching the entire season through AMAZON PRIME.  Amazing!  A great TV series.  Kenneth Cranhan as Pompey and Claran Hinds as Caesar are both wonderfully acted.  The glue for the series is an unlikely pair, Lucius Vorenus, played by GRAYS ANATOMY's Kevin McKidd and Titus Pullo played by Ray Stevenson.  This is a broad scoped show dome marvelously.  What TV should be.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
"HBO and the BBC have really outdone themselves with this first season. A brilliant action-packed and highly  emotionally charged violent series doesn't just tell the story of the rise to power and death of Caesar, but portrays the most violent ancient Roman world, where we of today forget just how cheap life was back then. You see for yourself through the eyes of two centurions, who get wrapped up in the intrigue and as mere pawns tragically manipulated and toyed with by all levels of society.Joe Wocoski, Author"
"Costumes, acting, scenes, all top shelf.  This series depicts life in Rome during the reign of Ceasar and Mark Antony.  It's excellent.  Great show, it is violent so children probably shouldn't watch it.  Great scenery.  Some full male frontal nudity if you like that and lots of hot steamy scenes!"
"Excellent writing and acting.  Good character development.  A very entertaining show, which gets better with each episode.  It rates with other top HBO series."
"My husband and I started watching ROME a couple weeks ago and are finishing the second season tonight.  It is really fascinating to see the cold, dry facts we heard growing up come alive this way.  Of course, it isn't for youngsters.  It is an HBO program after all.  Be warned that it contains lots of nudity and lovemaking."
"The entire series 1 & 2 are brilliantly written, directed, performed and produced. The set design, costumes, integration of historical fact with fiction make for compelling viewing. The opening animated graffiti with live action integration and sound design also set the stage for each episode. Even though it is the same for both series I enjoyed watching it over and over at the front of each episode!The acting and cast are brilliant, HBO really know how to produce -this series is one of their best highly recommended!"
"Early Roman history has never interested me much, but this series is so well done that I found myself entranced and inspired to find out what was truth and what of it was pure fiction!  Anything that can wisk you back in time, capitvate your whole mind space so that finishing the story is almost an obsession and inspire you to desire to know even more is undoubtably a triumph!  There are moments of....well, extremely adult content to put it delicately....that would or at least might not set well with parents of young impressionable children, but otherwise, this is historical fiction of the highest quality!"
"This is not the Rome of your childhood education or the Rome of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. This is the story of a comparative Rome from both ends of the social spectrum; Julius Caesar as he rises to dictator and defeats Pompeii miserably, graphically and definitely vindictively. Mark Antony rises to power as well, the spoiled underling of Caesar whose desire for power in every form is graphic throughout the first season. In contrast, the life of a simple soldier, Lucius Verena and his sidekick Titus Pullo live complicated lives in Rome as they try to return to civilian life after the Gallic Wars. Quite a bit of nudity in this series, violence and total depravity which, of course, all conspired to destroy Rome. Extremely in-your-face series but I found it intriguing and compelling."
This is probably one of the greatest TV series ever made.  It lasted only two years but will be remembered far longer.  The first season covers the period of Ancient Rome from the split between Caesar and Pompey to the murder of Caesar on the senate floor.  The writing and acting is superb and was well thought out.  The creators learned about Roman History and paid attention to fact.  In addition they added two wonderful fictional characters based on real people who are barely known who bumble through the time period experiencing history first hand.  Attia is another character whom history has told us little about and she is fleshed out in the same way.  The fiction and fact meld into a facinating mix of storytelling.  I highly recommend this TV series.
"HBO'S ORIGINAL AND AWESOME FIRST SEASON OF ROME IS A STYLISTICALLY AWESOME SPECTACULAR SERIES.EACH AND EVERY EPISODE HOLDS EVERYTHING FROM INTRIGUE TO ENGAGING ACTION AND ADVENTURE ALONG WITH MEMORABLE CHARACTERS THAT GO FROM ALL-TIME HIGHS TO ALL-TIME LOWS. SOMETIMES BRUTAL AND GORY, THEN BEAUTIFUL AND TOUCHING, ROME STANDS ALONE AMONG HBO'S NUMEROUS AND SOLID SERIES. AS SOPRANO'S WANES, ROME GROWS IN STENGTH AND INTENSITY.HAVING JUST WATCHED THE FIRST 3 EPISODES OF SEASON 2 - WHICH IS JUST GETTING BETTER AND BETTER - I HAD TO PURCHASE SEASON 1.IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED OR BOUGHT THIS AMAZING SERIES, THEN YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST. BELIEVE ME, YOU WON'T BE SORRY."
"I loved Rome for it's attempt to give us a glimpse into the complex world of Rome, one so like and unlike our own."
The complete series is available. Historically correct almost with an interesting back story.  An adult series with a fine cast.If you like quasi-historic drama you'll really enjoy this extravaganza.
"that the show was so well done. very impressive. great acting, words, sets, and story. i don't know that rome was like this, but it does bring some ideas of how it might have been. one thing is the lack of communication that we enjoy these days. another is the pagan worship of gods. these things may have changed, but not the desire for money and power to control. very happy to see a really good show."
"Have only watched a few episodes, but very good.  Historical detail  is good, gives a pretty good insight into the times, political and social.  Colorful, and it makes history fun to watch."
"Rome, HBO's ambitious, and expensive, series revolving around the events leading up to the assassination of Julius Caesar (Ciaran Hinds), is a sight to behold.  Created and filmed by a plethora of talented individuals (including legendary film maverick John Milius), Rome is brought to life with a fantastic set design that must be seen to be believed; it's as if the city is breathing.  The story follows two of Caesar's soldiers (Ray Stevenson and Trainspotting's Kevin McKidd) who find themselves throughout many events in Roman history, beginning with inadvertantly rescuing Octavian (Max Pirkis), being lost at sea, assisting Cleopatra (in more than one way, this episode will leave you laughing) and Caesar's struggle with Pompey Magnus (Kenneth Cranham).  Despite some historical inaccuracies, Rome is everything you'd come to expect from an HBO series: rich characterizations, an engrossing story, and a superbly assembled, large cast (including James Purefoy as Marc Antony, Kerry Condon, and Polly Walker as the scheming Atia), Rome is compulsively addictive viewing, made even more so by the climax and of the season finale, which will have you begging for more."
Its a great show but its a shame it didn't go on I think this was one of the shows that went bust with the strike a few years ago.
"This is in my opinion the best Cable TV dramatic series that has ever aired. I know 'The Sopranos' is very popular and so is 'Breaking Bad' but if you have to choose - this is the winner.Now I'll admit that I am a fan of Roman history. I have read all of Tacitus, Suetonius, Livy, Plutarch, and Polybius as well as a number of the minor historians. I have read many modern historians who wrote about Rome like Delbruck. And I have read lots of historical fiction set in Rome. So I can't claim to be neutral about the time period.This series gets a lot of things right that are usually gotten wrong. For example the rival cable  Starz  answered this series with a Roman themed series of their own - Spartacus. Spartacus is wildly inaccurate. It is more like alternative history than history. It doesn't even seem to take place on earth much less in earth's history. Spartacus is simply cable TV pornography. I like a little pornography from time to time but Spartacus became just silly. Both series showed full frontal nudity of both sexes but the HBO series handled these elements much more wisely.This series is not perfect. They have made some historical mistakes. I could point out where they got it wrong as a way of demonstrating how clever I am, but I won't. There are several issues of interpretation of  events and facts that I could argue with but I could be wrong too. Where the evidence is ambiguous different people will choose to believe different aspects.On the whole the producers have presented us with a miracle of verisimilitude. It looks like Rome and the characters act like Romans."
"An easy watch, I flew through both seasons in like 4 days. Historical and fictional mixed very well. loved itI liked how ""et tu brute"" was omitted. For whatever silly reason, it just said ""we're above that crap"""
"""Lucius Vorenus: It makes no sense. We should have been stopped by now. Why is Rome not defended?Titus Pullo: Our boys scared 'em off, eh?Lucius Vorenus: Soldiers of the Republic do not run, so it must be a stratagem, a trick.Titus Pullo: It's a good trick.Lucius Vorenus: Unless the gods have abandoned Rome... If Mars were watching, he would not allow such a disgrace.Titus Pullo: Maybe he was havin' a crap and missed it.""Sex, dancing girls, severed heads, gallows humour, four-letter words, strong women, and power displays are all to the fore in this marvelous series. ""Rome"" came on like a lamb, stole our hearts and minds and went out like a Lion. A series like no other. This is a story about a great man, Julius Caesar, played by Ciaaran Hinds, glorious and handsome man. We came to praise him and we do. We come to like Julius Caesar and we know what is to come. He is a benevolent leader and mixes with the local soldier group.  The standout characters are two of Caesar's soldiers, Lucius Vorenus played by Kevin McKidd and Titus Pullo played by Ray Stevenson. They are real people, have real hearts and minds and can suffer along with the rest of us.""Rome"" is a 100 million dollar HBO series. The scenes are glorious, depravity and lusty and dirty. We are privy to the real sex and feelings of the characters and what a group they are. We come to like most of them. The costuming is marvelous, 4,000 pieces of wardrobe were made or found. The scenery is fabulous- the olive trees in the Sacred Grove of the Forum set are over 200 years old. It is this kind of thing, maybe small in the realm of things, but this is what makes up the gloriousness of this series, ""Rome"". I absolutely loved it and was glued to the TV and watched each episode several times.""Rome"" has been nominated for several awards and justly deserves each one:BAFTA Awards: BAFTA TV Award for Best Production Design, Best Visual Effects, Best TitlesCinema Audio Society, USA: C.A.S.

We knew how it should end, but the in-between was such a joy to behold. The acting, the story, the scenery, the costumes, the brutality, the political intrigue, the characters who come to life, drag us in. You can't help it, you love these people, you don't want the series to end. It does, but it is only Part One. ""Rome"", Part Two is to come, and it is enough to keep us going, waiting.

"It is HBO.....everything that HBO does is top notch and worth watching, Rome is a beautiful/bloody/sexy show and a very interesting ride. It may make you want to find out more about everyday Roman life...A+++"
"Movie, actors, scenery, sequences were excellent.While acknowledging it wasn't designed as a &#34;Prime Time&#34; series (sorry for the pun),  I grew very tired of the constant use of that ubiquitous &#34;F&#34; word.  History has recorded the crudeness of their vernacular, so the screaming reminders, tailored no doubt in reference to our own evolving society,  added little historical authentication or credibility.  In fact, I found it quite contradictory as most conversations were so grammatically proper."
"I watched this twice, to make sure I really got it and to test my perceptions of it.  The first time, I watched it in big blocks of three hours over consecutive days and got very tired of it, kind of waiting to get to Caesar's assassination for it to end.  The second time, I watched each episode separated by a few days, and it was much much better that way.  Like all good films, I saw much more and am sure that it will get even better with subtleties and nuance on repeated viewings.The plot follows Caesar as he ends the Gallic War, crosses the Rubicon as a revolutionary (or demagogue or psychopath or whatever), and becomes dictator, ending with his murder.  However, rather than a single character, such as Claudius in I Claudius, the story omnisciently follows several lives of those revolving around Caesar.  You have aristocrats (supporters and opponents), soldiers, and the normal riff-raff of Rome.  In many ways, the main character really is Rome itself, as Caesar is at best a shadowy figure, while the others appear and reappear suddenly.The principal characters are the honorable Centurion Vorenus and his troublesome sidekick, the brutal legionnaire  Pullo.  They are entirely fictional, and while the actors that portray them are very good, they came off as a bit of a plot device, to get the viewer into certain places and to illustrate things that were occurring.  They pop up in Caesar's last major Gallic battle, scramble for work in ROme, join Caesar's civil war effort in Greece and Egypt, then return to seek new careers in Rome.  They stumble across Pompey, Cleopatra, and Octavian (the future Augustus), all the while rather oblivious to the true meaning of events unfolding around them, even though Vorenus becomes a Senator.  That being said, the intrigues that weave their way through the story are quite fun, and while embellished as all historical fiction must be, accurate in the outline of events as we know them.  You also have the aristocrats (actual historical figures, though with added fictional details) of Atia and Servilia; they are mortal enemies, both connected to Caesar and intriguers that are as cold as they come.I did not need to watch this to learn the history, though it would definitely be good for that.  For me, the greatest pleasure is the painstaking accuracy of the portrayal of Rome and life at that time.  The viewer is served a host of wonderful images, vivid colors, and very well drawn characters.  You can not only smell Rome, but feel the chaos and fear that convulsed the city at this time.  Then there is the manner in which people lived, evocations of their non-Christian religious beliefs and rituals, the conditions in which slaves lived, and the character of the Roman aristocrat, who would resignedly accept death for the sake of honor or as the price for risking political gain.  It is truly wonderful, and the bonus disk has excellent mini-documentaries that explain much of it.  (I did find inaccuracies, such as the claim that ""anything goes"" sexually - the Romans were notorious homophobes, for example - but these were very few.)Warmly recommended.  While the story and drama are not as tight as in I Claudius, it is an absolutely first-rate evocation of a vanished world."
"""Rome"" is my personal favorite miniseries ever.  It has a gritty authenticity that transports the viewer to the Rome of Julius Caesar's time.  The acting is first rate, the storylines are terrific, there is very little not to like about this miniseries.  My favorite aspect of this series is the friendship that develops between Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo (Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson).  The character study of the differences between these two men is really fascinating.""The Stolen Eagle"" is the first episode of the miniseries and one of the best.  Julius Caesar concludes his war in Gaul and must now confront the Senate over his future.  Well, we all know what happens next, but this episode and series make it suspenseful nontheless.Highly recommended.  RJB."
"the right mix of drama, violence, and T/A.  I can't believe I waited this long to watch it.  There's only two seasons so try not to binge watch it..."
I enjoy period pieces. The Rome episodes are very enjoyable. Some portions are very gory but other portions are fun. I'm looking forward to Season 2.
"A well done series which is typical of HBO. Drama, action, adventure, sex, violence, and a little history to boot what's not like."
"I love everything about this season of Rome1  The introductory scenes of Rome and the catchy music begin the seduction. They photography is beautiful.  OMG the story line is at once familiar but new.  The characters are completely fascinating.  The story takes place as the Roman Empire begins to breakdown due to power struggles, civil war, etc.  The shows the aristocrates and the common people as they live through, react to, and adjust to the rapidly changing political climate.  Fascinating!!!!!"
"I love Rome. If you are looking for something enjoyable, historical and very close to real life, this is the video for you. I have read various stories on Rome and Cleopatra. The only thing I didn't like is their portrayal of Cleopatra. But, most of it is not about Cleopatra it really is a about Rome. I do feel their portrayal of various characters such as Cesar and other well know people of Rome is pretty close to how they are portrayed in historical books. They did pick good actors to portray these various characters. They portrayed each character like you would imagine they looked. Sometimes I felt I was there and couldn't wait to see what would happen next. Buy it you will not be dissapointed!"
If i could give this ten stars I would.  I couldn't stop watching this.  I watched all three within a few days and was so upset when it ended!
"Very few television series can boast that they have been blessed with the greatest production values ever, as well has having a remarkable cast and crew that knew they were making something for generations of people to enjoy. ""Rome"" is one such series. A huge ratings winner when it was first broadcast on HBO, the series is set in Ancient Rome and deals with the death of Mark Antony, as well as Ancient Rome's transition from Republic to Empire, and Caesar's Invasion of Gaul. The backdrop of the story deals with the beautiful heterosexual relationship of two soldiers, Lucius and Titus, who find their lives intertwined and who basically fight for each other, at times often to the point of risking their own lives. What I have always admired ""Rome"" for is its depiction of how close it came in presenting itself as a series that actually looks like a theatrical release. The budget was probably the highest for any series and it shows on the screen. From the sets to the costumes, the producers were not shy in their attempt in bringing viewers back to a time in European history that many did not know much about, except for those who excelled in history while in grade school or college. This set comes with 12 episodes housed in a splendid DVD case made out of thick, strong cardboard that protects the dics. The set also comes with a slew of bonuses including audio commentary, interviews with the cast and crew, and so much more. Add this set to your DVD archive as you will view it over and over. A second season is also available, either in a stand alone set or the ""Complete Rome DVD Set"". Talk is a feature film is in post production with many of the original cast and crew already signed."
"Two powers go to war in the middle of an ever-growing empire. On one hand you have the supporters of the ""senate"" that are protected by Pompeii Magnus. On the other hand you have Julius Ceasar, fresh from his wars with the Gauls, now turning his sights on something more. In the process you have troops crossing the Rubicon, Rome switching hands between different types of dictators, little acts of treason that turn into big acts of war, and so many other bouts. also amongst these things are the lives of others that range from nobles to soldiers to commoners and even slaves, and the things that drive them.It is an amazing feat, Rome, expensive enough to finally do itself in but beautiful enough to enchant audiences for two glorious seasons.When I watched Rome, I was astounded by what it brought to its viewers. Not only did you have strong characters battling for the lifeblood of an empire but you also had other people battling for small pieces of the human puzzle. A soldier seeing his wife for the first time in ages, trying to understand love. Another soldier i the debt of the first, becoming a friend while also walking through the ranks. Marc Anthony and his command, gold and the way the treasury of Rome would be used, lost, and regained, love found tied to a cart, and so many other things. JHonestly, there is so much to contend with here that a review doesn't do it all justice. Put the sets into play as well as the lingo, the curses and the symbolism of the day, and you have yourself a show that really outdid itself.HBO really knows how to make something that counts.If you missed out on Rome, the DVD sets are a great thing to acquire. Not only will they make the mind happy but, in some ways, they do Rome justice. They speak of everday life, of the way Rome was, of the madness and the mayhem, and of the glory they saw in themselves. It is all educationally vast, brutal, and sometimes more than one bargains for. Personally, I loved it and wished I could have had more.Isn't that the way of all good things?"
"Rome makes I, Claudius look like a walk in the park on a sunny afternoon.  Rome pulls out all the stops and show everything in full splendor and gore:  sex, violence, torture, slavery, execution, adultery, orgies--you name it.  This is not for the squeamish; this is full-on history in all of its gory glory.  Great performances abound from Polly Walker, Ray Stevenson and Ciaran Hinds in particular."
"From beginning to end, the realization of this time period and poverty. Along with class standards and lack of morality."
"The best historical drama produced about the Roman Empire since ""I, Claudius"" and much more action driven ""Rome"" positively bristles with energy, a brilliant production design and stunning direction to compliment the strong scripts. ""Rome"" has every bit the look of a theatrical film with all the epic grandeur one could hope for. The first episode directed by Michael Apted and written by Bruno Heller (""Touching Evil"" provides viewers with a context for the series. Set in 52 A.D. ""Rome"" chronicles the fall of Pompey (Kenneth Cranham)and the rise of Gaius Caesar (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) and how it impacts two ""ordinary soldiers"" Lucius Vorenus (Kevin McKidd from ""Kingdom of Heaven"") and Titus Pullo (Ray Stevenson ""King Arthur"" and the TV show ""Waking the Dead""). Their lives are entwined with Caesar and the change of Rome from a Republic to an Empire that is ultimately ruled over by Octavian. As we first meet Caesar he has conquered the Gauls but at his victory Gaius receives devastating news; his daughter and Pompey's wife died during childbirth while he conquers the north. Suddenly the tenuous strands that bound these former allies and friends together have been cut. Pompey claims he won't betray a friend but makes plans behind the scenes to support his position. Many in the Roman Senate are concerned that Caesar's great victories will allow him to wrest control from Pompey. The nobles in the Senate convince Pompey to betray his friend Caesar and undermine his reputation before his return to prevent him from possibly taking control of the Republic.Great performances, top notch production values and writing make this show as distinctive as ""Deadwood"" and ""The Sopranos"" in their prime.The price is high so the packaging, extras and look of the show better be top notch. It is. Packaged in a hard box the packging appears pretty darn sturdy and when you open it there are images from the series. As usual HBO provides an exceptional transfer with bright vivid colors and deep, rich blacks. I didn't detect any major digital flaws and analog flaws are nonexistent. The 5.1 audio mix is marvelous filled with detail and flawless sounding.We get eight commentary tracks including producer/writer and creator Bruno Heller along with a mix of actors and crew. Four also feature historical consultant Jonathan Stamp who also provides a historical text commentary that crops up from time to time with fascinating tidbits. If you think divorce is a problem in our culture wait until you find out how often the Roman's divorced. Both provide quite a bit of history and production trivia about shooting the series although there are long stretches of silence they more than make up for these with their lively discussion when they do talk. There are a number of terrific featurettes on Roman society and the production of the series but the best as far as I was concerned (outsome of the commentary track on the first episode, I haven't had a chance to listen to the others yet)is the text commentary with historical facts. When they pop up you can push enter on your remote and be taken to a page of further text and information on Roman society. These pop up quite often and provide both historical facts and also background about some of the events and things referred to in the dialog. My only complaint and it is that when you hit return after reading the page sometimes it will take you back to the beginning of the episode vs. returning you to the point you were at. Perhaps this is a flaw in the set I got or a problem with my DVD player (I actually watched it on my computer). I'm not sure.We get five featurettes that are scattered throughout the set with the bulk of the special features on the sixth disc. First up is ""Friends, Romans and Countrymen"" which gives those unfamiliar with Roman history the background on the main characters and all the shenanigans they were up to without spoiling the plot.Another great HBO series, ""Rome"" is both involving drama and also full of spectacular action sequences. The performances by the actors are all strong. Highly recommended. If you can't buy it rent it you'll enjoy it."
"For anyone who wants to really enjoy this five star, most excellent series, you won't see it on this cut down, over edited version.  Obviously the most recent batch of movie hackers have no appreciation for the hard work and supreme talent the origional ROME series was all about.  It's sad to see this happen again, during the first launch of HBO on Amazon.But the uncut disks, producers cut, and you won't be sorry.  Watch this version on Amazon, and you're missing 25 percent of the movie."
If you love cynicism and wit then Daria is the show for you. In season 2 the creative team behind Daria take the show to another level. They go deeper into the world of a high school teen as seen through the judgmental eyes of Daria.
"When I am feeling down and need company, Daria does it for me!! No other show expresses my own sense of the absurd."
"I like this teen angst anime. I love the sarcasm and hidden thoughts running throughout this season as well as Season 1, Good laid back-about time to sleep-entertainment."
I am old enough that I grew up on cartoons. I read comic books. I am not a fan of the computer image in most series. The art that is Daria reminds me of my first memories of what is now called an &#34;animated&#34; series.  What makes me watch it is the writing and characters. I started watching tv in the 50's. I have watched animation for many years. I know what I like and I like Daria.
"If you are a Daria fan, you will love the spoof  on high school, families, stereotypes, etc. I loved the show when it originally aired and we have quoted the show for years..it's part of our family snarf culture"
"Refreshingly nihilistic and amoral, this classic MTV animated series from the 1990s represented a truly wonderful break from the saccharine pap we're usually fed. It offered us a take on high school life light years away from the idealised vision to be found in so many shows. What we have here is considerably closer to the brutal - and just plain stupid - reality. What's more, ""Daria"" is a show that manages to pull all this off with a dry, rapier wit, and its own tersely ironic sense of style.I know that five star reviews tend to predominate here on Amazon. So much so that it becomes almost a running joke. I think that's because according to Amazon's stated guidelines, five stars simply means ""I love it!"", and most folks tend to review what they love. But in all honesty, this really is an extraordinarily good piece of animation. One well worthy of five stars by just about any criteria.As  is the case with any TV show transferred to other formats, it needs to be acknowledged that there are really two issues here: the show itself and the transfer. As most readers will already know, with Daria the big issue with the transfer was always going to be the music. Because the original show sampled from so many popular artists, a full and faithful reproduction on a non-bootlegged release was always going to be a copyright impossibility. In the end, virtually none of the original background music survived.Given this reality, for the most part I take off my hat to the musicians who did end up providing the substitute background music for the DVD. They took on what was always going to be a thankless task and for the most part acquitted themselves pretty well. True, there are moments here and there where the music they provide is noticeably weaker than what we heard in the TV original. But overall they do a fairly solid job. Personally, what I miss most is not the lost background music per se, but the varied and eclectic range of songs used as end title music in the original broadcasts. These often provided an ironic or poignant counterpoint to the themes explored in the episode.Now for the show itself. In my opinion, the first two seasons really do see Daria at her best. I don't think this season (season two) is quite as good as the first, but it is very close. Hereafter... things begin to go downhill. Slowly and intermittently at first, but by progressively greater leaps and bounds. The most marked change is that Daria the sardonic observer of human folly is replaced by Daria the moral crusader. The show's dry edge isn't entirely lost, but it is substantially dulled.Curiously, the season two opener is an episode called ""Arts 'n' Crass"" where Daria and Jane collaborate on an artistic work that is then horrendously sanitized by school administrators. I can't help but wonder if the irony here is deliberate: if there was at least someone behind the scenes who fully grasped what was being done to the show, and felt the urge to give voice to this protest. If so, the protest is remarkably clever and doubly ironic, because how Daria and Jane handle the situation that has been thrust upon them fits seamlessly in with the show's new direction. A direction that is ultimately spelled out quite plainly in all its awfulness at the other end of the season, in the final episode ""Write Where it Hurts"". That one really does rather ominously show us the way of things to come.Fortunately, the episodes between these two bookends are for the most part in the spirit of season one. It is for this reason that I'm still able to give this season five stars. Things don't really descend into full blown sermonising until season three. So for true diehard fans of the show's original vision, this is your final chance to bask in the light of that vision (dare I say, ""the harsh light of reality""?) before the coming of the dark times.Enjoy it while it lasts!Theo."
"I watched this without expectations. I mean, it's not actually a Jane Austen story. It's only a mash-up by the greatest stretch of that term. And -- cue the red flags and warning lights -- it's a mini-series.At this point, I think I've watched it at least 10 times. I absolutely LOVE this story, and the characters are wonderful. The casting is sublime.I will never look at Wickham in the same way, again. This is a wonderful spin on his character. In fact, this mini-series takes liberties with most of the characters, and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Alex Kingston (River Song in Dr. Who) presents a wonderfully dimensional Mrs. Bennet. Hugh Bonneville as Mr. Bennet is charming and more sympathetic, as well.If there's any flaw in this, it's that it ended exactly where it should. While that may sound like &#34;where's the flaw...?&#34;, the fact is, I wanted to spend more time &#34;lost&#34; in Austen.Wonderful, and highly recommended for Jane Austen fans who aren't absolute purists about the sanctity of the original story.  This is an adventure for the young woman who falls into &#34;Pride and Prejudice,&#34; as well as the viewer."
I love shows like this one that show you the thought process behind the masterpiece.  Very informative.  It would be nice if more shows like this could be created like maybe abiut Charles Dickens or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
"I have to be careful not to give too much away in this review, or it will ruin the experience for first time viewers. If you like Jane Austen, if you like Pride and Prejudice, and if you have a sense of humor, you should be amused by this. Very well filmed, very creative, mostly well acted, I really liked it. If you have already seen this on television, I will warn you of one letdown, Amanda Price's rendition of Petula Clark's DOWNTOWN has been edited out on these discs, at least in the U.S. version, which was a disappointment. That was probably done due to copyright issues. Also, one note for non-British viewers, when Elizabeth calls Miss Price Miss Spencer, and says it is because the name is ""tailored in your undergarments"" that is a reference to Marks and Spencer, a British Dept. store chain, who are recognized for the quality of their ""undergarments"", which, of course, have a Marks and Spencer label in them. The joke does not make sense to most American viewers."
"I am not a Jane Austen purist and, as such, can enjoy take offs and films of her work that are not entirely accurate.  This is my favorite.  It blends contemporary London life, morals and technology with those of the early 1800's.  It is a ""through the secret door"", trading places feature that further highlights what Jane Austen was trying to say about culture, high and low.  The switch between the two women (remaining nameless, no spoilers here) leads to a revised Pride and Prejudice holding delightful revelations about what customs mean and why they are important.  This is not a serious film, however, more like a romantic comedy, and much of it is very funny.  So suspend your practical takes on anything Austen and go get lost.  You will have a ball!"
It took me some time to get used to the mix of modern day and early Times. But it was a great idea. I enjoyed every episode and would recommend this series. There was few slow moments but it kept my interest had it not then I wouldn't have purchased or watched all the parts.
This is such an interesting concept for a story. Really enjoyed it. No something I couldn't get enough of but seem to always goback for more.
"Ray Winstone (you may recognize him from the movie ""Sexy Beast) is Vincent, the head of his own P.I. firm. He is assisted by his small crew of associates. Vincent may appear to be a tough guy, and he can be. He delivers tough news with directness, yet ultimately has a heart of gold. He takes on cases that often have excellent plots and the interaction and caring of his staff is wonderful. This is a mystery/drama above all else, but can be funny and touching at the right times. I only wish there were more episodes."
"Of course this show is going to be wonderful. Tortured, decent man runs into moral dilemmas all day long and rises above them all with honor and humbleness. Love this guy anyway. he could read a phone book and sound delightful"
"I had honestly not heard of this series before, looking for an entertaining mystery/detective series, I gave it a try. Excellent scripting, superlative casting, first-rate acting throughout. The supporting cast members are as capable, attractive, and entertaining as the lead. It's impossible not to like Vincent Gallagher: tough but vulnerable, funny, brave, all man. The setting in Manchester was a plus, also: not the city one thinks of first for a thriller."
"both my 2 and 6 yr old cannot have enough of it, they are big fans and enjoyed this season."
Blue's Clues is a wonderfully engaging show for pre-schoolers. There's an educational theme to each half hour show and the host involves the viewers in the fun and games.
Blues is a super sweet TV show for kids! The best part is it's not so annoying that you go nuts. It's actually cute and entertaining.
I really love to watch this show all time.  my mom has bought every episode that's available on instant video for me
thanks to prime membership I can watch these!my sis and I watched this show with kids we used to nanny for and now I watch it with my daughter.
"My son still loves Blue's Clues and it is a show that I never worry about him watching, as I know it is very sweet and appropriate"
my young great grandson loves this app.  he watches for hours and thoroughly enjoys it.  glad to see him so engrossed.
"This season is really underrated in my opinion.  It has some of my favirote episodes in it like the three part Coon and Friends episode.  The commentary is also great, because Matt and Trey finally explain more about Kenny's awareness of his deaths and immortality.  I just love the whole comic book vibe of these three episodes and how all the kids have their own super hero persona. This blu-ray has some funny deleted scenes too and a bonus episode of the original Coon episode. If you're a South Park fan then this is a must have for your collection."
This season was hilarious to me because of the all of the coon episodes. I got a good deal on it and this season was honestly one of the better seasons in quite some years.
"South Park has become like the Simpsons in that it's aired so long the fanbase is split. Those who love it and those who think it is old, stale and should be put down. I can't speak to how I feel about the Simpsons, that's a different issue, but as far as South Park all I can say is I'm still laughing. I don't hold South Park up to the same criteria as other shows, it's an entity all its own where the point has always been to tune in and have some laughs at current issues with our four favorite foul mouthed fourth graders. To me if South Park still makes me laugh then it's still a great show.The show has changed its style many times over the years and this season represents another change, I really liked the pace and style of the episodes this season. It starts a little slow, in my opinion, but gears up by ""You Have 0 Friends"" and only gets better from there. This season contains two fan loved multi-part episodes and one of them is the most controversial episode the show has done in recent years. Was it 'Classic' South Park? Too soon to tell, but certainly great South Park this year.This 14th season contains the following 14 episodes:Sexual Healing - The country searches for an explanation for all the recent famous people cheating or becoming supposed ""sex addicts"", in the process two of the boys from South Park are revealed as sex addicts themselves. [A great episode in that it doesn't make fun of the rich men cheating as much as it makes fun of the people who keep trying to dissect why they do it]The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs -  Reading a banned book in class inspires the boys to write their own filthy book, one that mentions Sarah Jessica Parker 465 times, sick! When they are caught and blame it on Butters he becomes a national bestseller until his next book gets a famous celebrity killed. [Pokes fun at a lot of things, possibly even the idea that Matt and Trey feel people find deeper meaning in their writing than they intend, among other things such as media blaming art for the actions of clearly insane people]Medicinal Fried Chicken - Randy radiates his balls in order to be prescribed medicinal marijuana. Meanwhile Cartmen essentially lives the life of Tony Montana, Scarface, only with fried chicken and gravy rather than cocaine. [Lots of funny visuals if a little weak on the poignant social commentary]You Have 0 Friends - Kyle ""friends"" a loser kid with no friends on facebook when he feels bad for him but soon he becomes an outcast himself. Stan gets tired of facebook and wants to delete his profile but there's one problem, it won't let him. [If Social Network ""brilliantly"" tells the story of how facebook started, this episode brilliantly portrays what it has become and certainly what it will turn into if we don't stop it now!]200 & 201 (CENSORED VERSION ONLY) - After seeing Tom Cruise working at a fudge packing plant the boys piss him off and 200 celebrities come back to get their revenge on the town of South Park. Things escalate when the ginger kids return and when we may finally find out...who is Eric Cartmen's father?[The episode becomes centered on whether or not they can show ********. Nice to have all the call backs, unfortunately the DVD/Blu-ray version is censored like the broadcast version was. Fairly ridiculous on Comedy Central's part but I want to own the season regardless and am not sure why people are getting up in arms. Still, we should be able to see ******** if we want to see ********!]Crippled Summer - Jimmy, Timmy and Nathan???(the drug dealer from Up the Down Steroid) all go to 'special' summer camp and pay homage to classic cartoons as Nathan tries to foil Jimmy and the cooler kids. Meanwhile Towelie gets a long awaited Intervention. [All I have to say is hahahaha, laughed my ass off at both stories]Poor and Stupid - Cartmen gets Butters to help him become a NASCAR driver. The title sums up the main repetitive joke of the episode but it's hilarious to watch unfold. [Laughed my ass off again]It's a Jersey Thing - Jersey starts to spread across America and reaches South Park causing Kyle (or Kylie B.) to face some inner demons he didn't know about his mother or himself.Insheeption - A trip into Mr. Mackay's twisted childhood mind allows Matt and Trey to mock the confusion of Inception and the constant music played throughout the movie to make dialogue seem more intense. I loved the movie but love this episode even more.Coon 2: Hindsight (1), Mysterion Rises (2), Coon Vs. Coon and Friends (3) - In the three parter South Park serves up a sequel of sorts to the episode ""The Coon"". Now all the kids have super hero alter egos and a new hero named Captain Hindsight shows up on the scene mocking all the good people have brought to the world lately by pointing out what should've been done rather than actually doing something about it now. In part two Mysterion is finally revealed and explored and in part three we get some new insight into one of our favorite characters.Creme Fraiche - Randy become addicted to the cooking channel and thinks he should be a chef despite not being able to cook. With Randy busy Sharon finds herself a new toy that brings her all the pleasure a man can bring, a shake weight. [hahaha, the visual of that ridiculous shake weight. A great episode, silly, fun and makes good points, especially with how Randy gets turned on by the food network]A great season by my standards but everyone will have to judge for themselves. The three-parter is fun and feels more like classic South Park silliness to me but it does seem like they wanted to do a standalone Coon 2 episode that gradually turned into a three parter when they couldn't wrap it up. For once in a long time though it does add a new level to one of the characters and it has some good laughs. Not as rewatchable as the rest though.All episodes will contain the usual mini-commentaries by Matt and Trey which are always effeciently informative, if not a little too short for real fans.There is also a deleted scene from ""You Have 0 Friends"" starring Cartmen and the season 13 episode ""The Coon"" is included (despite fans who buy this set already likely owning the previous one).The Blu-ray releases for South Park have looked really sharp and I personally don't mind paying a little extra but for those who don't focus on vibrancy of the color and sharpness of picture just buy the DVD, the jokes will still be just as funny and you'll save a few bucks.So that's season fourteen, fans enjoy (unless you can't get over the one censored episode). Those who are no longer fans try to let those of us still laughing enjoy (you don't have to acknowledge the new seasons just as I don't acknowledge most seasons of the Simpsons), those who never were fans why the hell are you reading this? As far as season 15, two words - Can't Wait."
"I have never before (and will never again...probably) seen a show as delightful as this.  NYC has been integrated.  Demons, zombies, werewolves, robots, koala men, kongs (as in King Kong) and a never-ending parade of weirdos, misfits, and unidentifiable creatures all live together in peace and harmony.  Well, not so much peace and harmony, but they would if Mark Lily had anything to say about it.The show follows the rather inept - albeit good-intentioned - social worker as he tries to make a life for himself while doing his best to help the underprivileged & mentally, er..., &#34;special&#34; newcomers integrate into the wild city.  The antics the viewer is privy to already make the show a fantastic piece of work.  But what gives the viewer that sort of giddy feeling when they watch is the fact that the artists and animators have crammed every frame with sight gags.  From wacky posters, to the most random, off-the-wall, background characters/scenes, to easter eggs that reference past episodes, there isn't a single frame that doesn't convey just how creative (or crazy?) the people involved with this show were.It's a shame this work of art received only two seasons, but they're both superb and worth watching again and again and again..."
"I love this show and I wish they had done more seasons.  Heck, they could do a live version of this show and Jason Bateman would be perfect for the lead.  It really is a funny and creative show and worth watching"
"I love this show. It is adult-themed, witty, and hilarious to watch. It streams extremely well with all of my devices. It is free to stream if you are a prime member."
I got this for my granddaughter. she loved it. she sat and watched it over and over and would get more of these videos the next time she visits.
"One of my 2 year old's favorite tv person is Elmo. This series is different from the plain sesame street, each episodes teach the children little &#34;life lessons&#34;."
This show is adorable. My son loves to sing the theme song and enjoys the adventures in this season as well. Glad that it's free as well.
It's a cute little show from what I've seen.  My kid will sing along with the intro.  They always rescue an animal in trouble.  Some of the ideas for rescuing are actually pretty clever for a kids show.
Great show for preschoolers.  My 2 year old twin grandchildren love it and it teaches how to be a helper.
My 2 year old loves the &#34;Wu Pets&#34; as he calls them.  He wanders around the house impersonating the Big bad wolf from the save the three little pigs episode all day.
"It's Wonder Pets... Friends to the Animals and 4 and under crowd alike. Good Messages, catchy tunes... Kids seem to really stay engaged when watching"
My grandson loves Wonder Pets and I love listening to him sing the song.  He's going to be 3 in March and he just loves watching the animals and even dances to the music.  He says it makes him happy!
I am so jealous that I don't get to have a job like this. It wouldn't be Sunday without an episode of MythBusters. Rarely do I disagree with their methods of testing the myths.
"Well, OK you can watch it at home, but get your kicks from watching these zany and enthusiastic odd balls (never thought I'd ever use those words) try to tear apart myths both popular and obscure and in the process blow up and/or burn down anything that gets in the way of their pursuit of the truth. Blowing up a cement truck is pedestrian next to setting a plume of coffee creamer on fire. If you like c-4 you'll love this show!."
"Again, love all episodes and seasons. No Pain No Gain and Duct Tape 2 were highlights, with Mythbusters Top 25 being the real jewel (explosions set to Tchaikofsky -Epic)."
I have loved this show ever since the first episode.  I love how two/ now five &#34;regular guys&#34; use science to explore our world in an entertaining way.
I think I've seen every episode of Mythbusters but I always enjoy watching some of their older episodes especially when there is so little on regular TV worth watching anymore.
"For introducing Victoria Justice to us and put her in her own TV show, I just wish It would have lasted as long as iCarly."
This is a good clean show for young people.  Finally a show with teens who can actually sing.  The stories are Some what silly but they are entertaining.
"Victorious is a probably the best show out there the entire family can watch; this show is enjoyed by all of the kids in my neighborhood through high school and, as an adult, I enjoy watching it with my kids.  The jokes are pretty funny and what I really like the most as a parent is the show doesn't cross the line like a lot of children-focused shows seem to do with being a tad risqu&eacute;.  The singing is excellent!We have watched all of the episodes of this season for free via our Prime membership vs. the regular price of $29.99 for the whole season: not a bad deal!"
"I love this show. I love the characters and how tween it is in a good way. Tori is funny and cute, kat is ditzy and cute, and well the other chick that reminds me of Angelina Jolie as a teenager is super dark. Its a funny show, if you like this watch iCarly plus Sam and kat!!"
This is a good season for preteens.  My kids watched it over and over again.  I am considering buying season 2
"A great program for toddlers. Easily followed story lines, pleasant music, relatable characters, nothing that would give nightmares. The animation quality is good."
"My 3 year old granddaughter loves to watch little bear. As a Prime member she gets to see the entire season one and two on my Tablet or on TV using Roku. Little Bear teaches kids to play nice together and to appreciate your elders who, in turn, give lots of love, attention and respect right back. A great show for the little ones who's minds absorb information like a big sponge."
"One of the first words out of my daughters mouth. &#34;Bear,&#34; she says in a cute little British accent while pointing at the screen. She loves it and it seem to present good values. I really enjoy this show. My parental approval is two thumbs up."
This was exceptional for the three to six year old.  The grand kids still insist to watch each cartoon over and over. I'd recommend it to anyone.
"This is a very cute show. Little Bear is such a kind, tender hearted little bear. My three little grandsons love this show. Perfect for girls also."
I have always loved little bear even when I was a kid. My kids are getting a little older but they still enjoy this show. To me it's a wholesome show that shows many of the lessons kids growing up go through without all the annoying songs and voices.
We love Little Bear! He is so sweet and his playmates have delightful personalities! Can't wait to watch season three!
myself and my grand babies love watching the day to day activities between little bear and his family and friends. It's very peaceful and relaxing.
"My 21/2 year old grand daughter is always asking to watch this show. I created her own page on the laptop, with Amazon Prime Video as her home page. So now when she has TV time she can choose the show she wants, 'Little Bear' is one of her favorites.  Each episode is a learning experience."
"My kids absolutely love this show! Great, quality, clean programming for kids. Wish there were more shows like this one!!"
Great imaginative kids programming. It helps bring my kids down if they are too hyper before bed. They know it's time to calm down and let their imaginations take over when this show comes on.
Little Bear is very entertaining for young children. Good story lines with no violence. We enjoy watching as a family with the grandkids.
It was delightful!  Held my 3 and 4 year olds attention and they wanted more.  So nicely done too. Highly recommend
My daughter is 2 and she loves Little Bear. As a parent I like it because the storylines are always easy for her to follow and understand. I also like that the music/soundtrack to the shows are mellow enough that I can play them for her just before nap time and it doesnt get her wound-up like most other shows do.
"Little Bear and his friends - Owl, Duck, Cat, etc. are lovable and cute - the stories are engaging and make for fun viewing for little ones. Little Bear is one those kids' shows that you don't feel guilty letting your young child watch - it has good language, endearing characters that appeal to young children, and good production values without over-loud music and garish colors.The language is clean, and the characters, i.e. Little Bear and friends, are truly endearing. My daughter loved watching the episodes when she was three. This is a good production for young children, and a value buy. Highly recommended!"
"There were always some lingering questions about the quality of the water in the bottles and any thinking person has to wonder about all those plastic bottles going into the eco-system, but this is the first time I was exposed to an organized, detailed look at the entire industry.This documentary explores how bottled water comes about as well as the packaging and the impact on the environment. Let me tell you, if half of this is true (and I suspect all of it is) there is absolutely nothing positive about bottled water. It's as though that industry gets something for free, gets it onto the market at an unbelievably low cost and sells it back to you at an unbelievably high profit. Then they screw you on the back end by fouling up the environment. Essentially, they are charging you big money (more than you're paying for gasoline) for an inferior grade of a product you can get for nearly free. Not to mention the added health risks involved from drinking from those plastic bottles.There are a few scenes where industry people are questioned on various matters and it even had me squirming. This is a horrible, horrible market in every aspect, and it is almost entirely unnecessary.I'm tapping out now. I'm going to get myself a stainless steel personal water bottle and grab my water from home. It's safer to drink, costs less and won't screw up the environment."
"1 Disc Widescreen, released August 10, 2010""Tapped"" is a documentary that discusses the question of whether clean drinking water is a basic human right or a commodity that can be bought and sold like any other. Stephanie Soechtig gives a behind-the-scenes approach to the bottled water industry that tries to control and profit off of this precious natural resource and the wastefulness of what happens to the P.E.T. bottles.75% of the planet is covered in water, but only 1% is drinkable. America's largest bottled water corporations are bottling our natural waters everyday and selling it back at 1900% of the cost of tap water. Some states like Maine, California, and Michigan are fighting back and are in trials with Nestle, the bottler of Poland Springs water for the rights to their community water.When so many documentaries focus on our dwindling natural resources, the loss of water would be much more frightening than oil. The truth that these companies like Nestle, Coca Cola, and Pepsi don't want you to realize is that bottled water is not cleaner, purer, or more healthy than tap water. They do not come from magical natural springs but from the same public sources as tap water. It is a completely unnecessary cost to the consumer budget that creates more waste and hurts communities that live around the refineries from pollution.The question left to be asked is how much of these facts are scare tactics and how much is a valid threat that needs to be acted upon immediately? Concern about waste, the environment, and the health of people in our community is certainly very important, but it would be very difficult to convince our country that more attention needs to be paid to water when it is so focused on oil. It is sad, but true! I encourage you to check out this documentary which I fear might not get as much attention as it deserves without grassroots word-of-mouth behavor.It is AMAZING how many people purchase bottled water when a filter on their faucet would work just as well and be cheaper in the long run. Bottled water is a luxury item, there are water fountains everywhere you go and it is much more environmentally sound to buy one reusable bottle and take it wherever you go.This DVD comes in an environmentally friendly slim case much like its predecessor, ""An Inconvenient Truth"" among others. It has won awards at several international film festivals including Honolulu in 2010, Anchorage in 2009, Eugene in 2009, and Charleston in 2009 as well as the Best of Fest award at the Colorado Environmental Film Festival in 2009.Bonus Features:It is AMAZING how many people purchase bottled water when a filter on their faucet would work just as well and be cheaper in the long run. Bottled water is a luxury item, there are water fountains everywhere you go and it is much more environmentally sound to buy one reusable bottle and take it wherever you go.There are extra bonuses on Central Valley and Agriculture, Chemicals in the Water, Sewer Water Treatment, Oil and Water, Privatization, and World Water Crisis. This just goes to show the abundance of information that Stephanie Soechtig and her team dug up on anything and everything related to the water before channeling the focus of the film to keep her audience on track. These are all interesting subjects on their own, but they do veer off the path of the most direct message she was aiming for and makes a lot of sense that these were edited out."
"I thought I was up to speed on the bottled water scam but TAPPED proves so engrossing I viewed the documentary twice.  I knew bottled water was no safer to drink than what comes out of the kitchen tap.  But TAPPED presents the information so powerfully I think it will teach a few things to those who already stopped buying bottled water while un-selling it to people who believe the Poland Spring and Dasani ""pure water"" sales pitch.TAPPED delivers three salient messages.  First, bottled water is no safer than tap water and we cannot trust private companies to regulate bottled water quality the way public authorities do tap water.  Second, the manufacture of plastic bottles releases deadly chemicals that are killing people who live near production plants, and the bottles themselves release elements not fit for human consumption.  Third, the pollution of discarded bottles is exterminating ocean life.Is there a soundtrack C.D. for TAPPED?  I can't remember the last film - commercial or documentary - that had as much cool music.As if the filmmakers know you won't be able to wait any longer to tell your friends and family to stop buying bottled water, TAPPED shares all its information in just 76 minutes.  The D.V.D. includes out-takes, however.See TAPPED.  As is the case with cigarettes, once you realize the harm it causes and what you pay for that, you'll wonder what benefit you ever got from bottled water.  The documentary also reminds us of the undue influence industry has over public welfare, with the drought-stricken state of Georgia seeing bottled water companies draining its reservoirs."
"I love watching these films and getting the outside perspective that you do not hear on the bias news or greed filled large corporations. I have to say, this absolutely disguested me (as usual), but unfortunately, if people do not step up to educate themselves then the supply will never change based on the demand.Here are some note worthy facts to consider:1. There are 6 major water corporations in the US, and all use a spring or tap water as the foundation of their product2. 75% of earth is covered in water but only 1% is drinkable, this leaves a profit market for this resource in the billions and climbing!3. Large corporations pump FREE water from natural springs or from taps, process it at their plants, package it then turn around and sell it (say for example at $6 per gallon)4. 40% of bottled water is just filtered tap water (Aquafina and Dasani are Pepsi and Coke corporations known to just bottle tap water)5. Oil refineries make Benzene derived chemicals that are marked PET or PETE on the bottom of plastic bottles (FYI- this chemical is known to cause cancer!!) Not only this but the plastic bottles end up contaminating the environment they're dumped in and the manufacturing plants that make them are known to leak these chemicals in the surrounding area6. Only one person overseas all the regulations for the bottled water at the FDA, and the FDA only regulates products that are sold state to state, so companies that bottle in Maine and sell in Maine are not required testing or inspection7. Corporations are self regulated and are not required to frequently submit reports on water purity and can test the bottled water themselves without outside expertise8. There is 46 more plastic than plankton in the middle of the ocean in a 2009 testI highly recommend watching this movie to anyone! This film has an excellent soundtrack, seamless b-role footage and good interview footage of scientists, environmentalists, US residents, corporations, FDA, EPA and eco-friendly agency directors.(To those of you who went a step further and looked on the FDA's website, I hope you realize that the FDA and EPA follow these same standards of allowing corporations to test their products without a standard when it comes to our FOOD & GOODS as well!! Even worse is that the FDA inspects less than 2% of imported food/ goods! ...Kind of makes you wonder what our tax dollars really pay for.)"
"(Note, older readers may remember the original Nestle's chocolate TV commercial which I've ""adapted"" above.)I just came to this 2009 film - released on DVD in 2010 - and I see that there are already 26 reviews posted, nearly all giving it five stars. I won't bother repeating much of what has been posted already but hope my comments are helpful to you in deciding whether to get this DVD or not.The 76 minute film can really be divided into three issues, each given a segment. The first has to do with the large beverage corporations - Nestle's (which owns Deer Park and other bottled water brands), Coke and Pepsi - that sell bottled drinking water. We learn that they literally TAKE the water from a small town in Maine and then sell it back to the residents for a profit. The second and third issues deal with the plastic bottles that hold the water. First there is the health issue of the DEP which is the material the bottles are made from. It has been proven that deposits from the material contaminate the water inside - water which was really tap water that was chemically treated - and that there are are serious health consequences. And we learned about health issues for those living near the petroleum plants that make the bottles. The third issue is environmental since MOST of the plastic bottles (soda as well as water) are not recycled (it's inconvenient for most users) and end up in landfill or the ocean. This is serious stuff.Yes, there is a place for bottled water. As I write this review we are expecting the second largest hurricane on record to come trough Southeastern Pennsylvania. We have filled water bottles but the water system could be polluted by the storm and that is the time we will turn to bottled water. But, as the film points out, it's through advertising - the fancy waters taste better than tap water and are better for you than soda (remember it's bottled by the soda companies!) - that so many small, non-recycled bottles are out there.The DVD contains 7 short (2-5 minute) additional chapters with interviews.It's been three years since this documentary was produced but I don't remember seeing much on the news as to any major changes. But change takes time and watching this film may bring enough ""calls for action"" to make a difference.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic"""
"Some actors are innately suited to certain roles.Brian Cox was great in The Escapist as an old , gritty , cynical prisoner with a hidden heart and Paul Dano as a young , indoctrinated zealot in There Will Be Blood .The Good Heart can only be comedic with the polarity between the same sort of roles. Dano is the stooge for Cox's satire; a jaded barman adopts a  kind but spaced out , homeless kid to apprentice into running his seedy batchelor bar out of a doggedness  to keep the bar's traditions alive since he doesn't seem to have much time left with a dodgy heart.I kept forgetting this was an American movie as the humour is so British.The film is enlivened by the the regulars at the bar and a stray female,  who intrudes onto this male bastion at one point. The barman and his apprentice wake up perspectives lacking in the other but not without its frictions , banter and kinship.This film has a continuous stream of amusement running through it against a backdrop of pathos with an ending that satisfys. Quite thoughtful in a way."
"This is one of those unforgettable little indy films. Funny, touching, bleak -- plus ducks. Well, one duck anyway. Estragon. If you do not watch this film, you are missing something special.It takes place mostly in a seedy NY bar. Jacques, played by the wonderful Brian Cox, is a misanthrope and a philosopher. To say he is eccentric is to understate the case considerably. He is not one of your cliched lovable old curmudgeons; his antisocial behavior borders on sociopathy.  Paul Dano is a young homeless man who is too innocent for the casual cruelties of the streets. Fate brings them together.Cox, who looks like a bulldog on a bad hair day, brings an incredible depth to the role of Jacques. An intellectual who lives in squalor, he ekes out a living in his bar...which serves only those few people he deigns to admit. Strangers are turned away.  The land the bar is sitting on, a prime piece of downtown NYC real estate, is worth countless millions, but when real estate developers try to buy the place, Jacques turns them down...out of spite and a sort of noble commitment to the past. The magic of Cox's stony and unforgiving performance is his ability to add nuance without selling out. Jacques is never lovable, but he is fascinating and we get brief, tantalizing glimpses into his soul...just a whisper here, and peek there. An unforgettable piece of acting craft.The film is bleak, but it's also fun. The scenes where Jacque debates Buddhism with the Chinese restaurant owner, explains the hidden meaning of broccoli to his protege, or gives him a lesson in brewing espresso are pure gold. Cox is, quite simply,a genius. Even so, it's Dano, who almost walks away with the film. His face is so open, so guileless, his eyes so wide, he just breaks your heart. You want to take him under your arm and shield him.The Good Heart is humorous but its soul is dark. Even the title is a black joke. The production is Danish/Icelandic. If this is a sample of the work coming out of those countries, we need to see much more. It makes our typical American blockbuster look like the stuff of children. Simply one of the best films I've ever seen.The writer/director is Dagur Kari, son of Petur Gunnarson, a quite famous Icelandic writer.  Kari has three other films and one short to his credit. Certainly worth tracking down."
Daria was one of the most witty and intelligent shows on the air back in the late 90s. I'd recommend this to anyone that grew up with a bit of an sideways look at high school.
My two year old loves gabba and we watch an episode every day. I like the guest stars and the musical guests and I like that the show tries to teach proper social behavior.
"Our toddler loves YGG. The music is fun for her and she loves to dance. Her favorite thing is Super Music Friends Show, hehe. Her favorite episodes from season 3 are Treasure, Circus, and Bugs. For some reason she is terrified of Superhero though. This is my toddler's favorite show and she knows some of the songs by heart, and I do too since she likes to ask me to sing &#34;Gabba songs&#34; to her at bedtime. Treasure by Blizentrapper is one of her favorite lullabys now! haha!"
"Our kid loves this show, and goes crazy whenever it comes on. Good, cheesy kids show. Would recommend to anyone, unless they have no sense of humor and don't like upbeat shows."
"Being an old lady steeped in childhood memories, I was at first aghast at this &#34;new&#34; show, that did not sing the old Mother Goose rhymes or tell the old fairy tales. But as I watched my grandkids getting into the dancing and using new phrases, and dancing and giggling with the characters, I slowly relented, let my hair down and learned to do the dancy dance with my babies."
can't say enough about this show- it's really good and cute. love all the characters. my daughter sings and does all the dancey dances. great show! put all on prime!
I love this series and so do my kids. It keeps them glued to their seat for hours on end.
"My 2 year old is so crazy for this show. His love for it has infected all of us, including his teenage brother! Keep'em coming!"
"My kiddo still loves this show, and having ALL of the episodes accessible via my computer was not the best idea...she requests them when I need to be working. If Nick Jr on demand isn't good enough (with about 4 episodes at a time to choose from), having Yo Gabba Gabba on DVD isn't thorough enough (true, some episodes are missing), then this is the solution. Every episode, viewable through Amazon.com. Dream come true for any fan."
"I don't know why, but my little ones love this show.  They seem to really love it.  My almost 2-year old son goes nuts for it."
"In this early (1989) Joel episode, MST3K takes on THE CRAWLING EYE. Giant, bulbous space-eyeballs w/ tentacles attack! Can Forrest Tucker save humanity? I actually like the movie on its own, but still love the jokes at its expense. It's obvious that the show is still evolving and &#34;finding itself&#34; at this stage. It's fun and interesting to watch the characters / personalities develop, along w/ the dialog and skits. A must for the MST3K fanatic!..."
"I'm going to come out and say it - I'm not a huge fan of the first season of MST3K. This episode is a classic and should be watched by any self-respecting MSTie. However, if you are wanting to get into the show, watch a few other episodes first. Werewolf, The Final Sacrifice, Devil Fish, and many others are good first MST3K episodes."
"I saw this about a half century ago and I still remember it. It gave me many a chill as an eight-year-old.This film has everything a film needs to be great:1. Crazy professors.2. Radioactive clouds.3. An observatory with steel doors.4. Some fair semi-noir acting.5. Funny commentary.6. Giant alien tentacled eye balls in the mist that eat people.Ah yes, this is one to savor. Really, it is. Try it and you'll see."
Thanks to the guys from MST3K!!!  When will be able to watch RIFF TRAX versions of movies on Amazon?  I might actually pay to watch a Michael Bay movie if we get RIFF TRAX audio with it.
This episode will have you laughing throughout. The MST3K crew does a great job at riffing this 80s B-movie. This is a great place to start if you want to get into MST3K.
I really laughed out of the chair watching this show.  I remember it from when I was a little girl.  The movie themselves are so cheesy but it's the commentary that will have you crying.  I love it!!
"If you love MST3K, you'll appreciate their treatment of this dreadful turkey from the 80s. Such bad writing, acting, everything! But such great riffs :)"
"I was so happy to see so many Mystery Science Theater 3k movies on Amazon. My husband an I wondered how in the world they find these oh-so-absurd movies! If you are not familiar with an MST3k, give this one a try. It is full of laughs especially for our generation that was born in the 60's or earlier. But it not, it's still got lots of laughs. Definitely one of the funnier Mystery Science movies! 1/6/2014"
I love these episodes!  True crime stories are so interesting and I love being able to watch them on my Kindle while my husband watches other things.
This is a really good show.  I love all these true crime documentaries and in this one they use forensic methods that regular people never hear about.  Sometimes it takes years or decades but justice is always served.
Get more season's! The ID channel is great in providing true crime. These channels are why I changed toAmazon Prime.
"From the bleak, broken world with its tiny personal living spaces and small pleasures, to the twisted plot that our character finds himself drawn into, this little gem is well worth your time. The animation is as strange and intriguing as the picture on the front, with realistic over-sized faces attached to inadequate bodies. The main character's deadpan acting adds a sublime sense of resignation to this futuristic view of life under corporate control. How interesting that this viewing coincides with the corporate destruction taking place off the coast of my state in the Gulf of Mexico. Seeing the power of a huge corporation first hand makes Metropia seem all the more possible."
"A gray and dystopic future, evil megacorp taking over the world and the people in it - OK, that part's been done. 'Metropia' stands out for doing it brilliantly. It's a lot more than that, though.Animation has explored the super-realistic, with just enough success that the discrepancies become especially jarring. This goes farther, well into the surreal. That allows for exaggerations of faces and figures, wide-eyed blankness and evil scowls that wouldn't be phyiscally possible for human actors. And, despite great advances in computer-aided post-production, animators can build their worlds from the ground up in the image they want, with no need to retrofit them into scraps of reality. This movie really does use animation in a novel and very distinctive way.Very enjoyable in many ways. Certainly not one for the kiddies, it scarcely qualifies as as ""adult"" movie - but body-shy viewers might have trouble with brief- and semi-nudity.-- wiredweird"
"THE INFIDEL (2010) is an English gem of a film - with a title so daunting and fearsome, this is a frightfully funny identity crisis film. Frankly, if you have NO sense of humor and are a racist, I would say stay away from this!This is Brighton. (I think.) Mahmoud Nazir (Omid Djalili) is a tubby, hyperkinetic Muslim with a short fuse and a foul moth to go with it. He's afraid of no man, yet he's as laid-back as an English Muslim can be. He evens picks a fight with an American Jewish cabdriver Lenny Goldberg (the great chameleonic bit player Richard Schiff).One day as Mahmoud cleans out his recently deceased mother's home, he finds his secret adoption papers. He discovers that he is Jewish, adopted out to a Pakistani family as a toddler. His real name is Solomon ""Solli"" Shimshillowitz, and worse yet: his father Israel is still alive in a nursing home.Mahmoud is now Jewish ... and he needs to 'learn how to be Jewish' just to see his real father.What follows is for me such a deeply personal film I could not stop laughing and I could not hold back tears. This may not affect you the same way ... but I share this story in common with Solli/Mahmoud (though I was not a Muslim). It is a battle for identity, a fight for one's life in the light of identity crisis that cannot be fathomed unless you've lived it. Or seen this excellent Oscar-worthy film.Mahmoud makes a scene in the civil servant's office once he's learned his Jewish identity, and security come to drag him out - to which he yells, ""You find out you're Jewish and suddenly some bloke in a uniform is leading you away?!"" - and I shouted, ""Amen, brother!!""Mahmoud will find that indignity to be the least of his trouble. Yet the humor you can expect, well, how about the mention of a character who is a liberal Jew but has become a Buddhist? - ""Renounces all material possessions ... but still keeps the receipts."" (My personal joke on that is I am Jewish but a Buddhist priest, so I sit still and wait for things to go on sale.)With coaching from Lenny so he can at least get a look at his dying father, Mahmoud faces the acid tongue of a bitter Jewish expatriate: ""Your name is Solli Shimshillowitz? Why didn't they just call you Jewy Jewjewjewjewjew and get it over with?!"" - and Mahmoud will have to face a very Zen training session which I immediately recognized as the Battle of the Oy, the Battle of the Vey, and the Battle of the Yarmulke.What Mahmoud has to do with his new yarmulke is so hilarious yet germane, I defy the viewer to describe the feelings he must be having. But I leave all this delight for you to see. And to learn.Mahmoud Solomon Shimshillowitz Nazir discovers that one cannot keep silent in the face of evil, of bullying, of prejudice, of threats - all of which he suddenly lives first hand, at everyone's hands. (All this from a film production that employed a company called MuJu.)Sometimes we have to stand up, get in people's faces, and yell, ""JESUS, MOSES AND ALLAH!!"""
"Adopted boy doesn't find out he's adopted until late in life. Raised as a Muslim but perhaps born as a Jew. A movie of insightful humor and yet serious topics e.g.dad has his Jewish son baptized as a Catholic at age 11. Years later the son, out of curiosity, asks his dad why both and dad says, ""You know son, just in case."" Insightful lines where Muslim says to Jew and Jew to Muslim, ""What is it with you people!"" A line that points out the commonality of racial/ethnic/religious stereotyping and prejudice. Use of dialogue, settings and props (e.g. placement of a The Koran and Hebrew Bible side by side). Unexpected ending where a wedding appears to be a Bollywood Hindi compromise to the Muslim/Jew discord that enveloped most of the movie.On the most serious side, our protagonist-antagonist characters get to the emotional root - death as a result of Israel-Palestine violence where one posits the innocent death by suicide bombers while the other counters with the United States of Israel superior military resulting in disproportionate deaths of thousands of Palestinians to hundreds of Israelites (the actual numbers since 2000 are closer to 6500 Palestinians of which 1300 are 18 or younger and 1100 Israelites with 130, 18 or younger).The other serious tet&egrave;-a-tet&eacute; they had was concerning the absurd claim to Jerusalem based on ""who got there first"". Help! Have humans regressed that much? (my comment).Interesting special features discussions amongst the crew about the film such as why comedy is so strong amongst the Jewish community yet not amongst Muslims, Buddhists, Christian fundamentalists. Posited was a culture of observation and an appreciation of irony. Not sure, but interesting."
I love a good documentary and this sure is one.  Great subject!  Well-done! I love hillbillies and stuff about hillbillies! This has inspired me to go on a hillbilly documentary buying spree.  Any suggestions? Please share! I love that the Whites are real and don't apologize! I just love this unusual and well-done subject matter.  The Whites are truly American rebels and Johnny Knoxville did a great job capturing it.
"THE WILD AND WONDERFUL WHITES OF WEST VIRGINIA (2009, 84 minutes) is one of the most interesting documentaries I've ever seen. Briefly, this chronicles the White Family, a gargantuan clan whose layabout, criminal personalities prompted a comparison with the Hatfield-McCoy feuds of the 19th century.Here we follow the animadventures of several generations of the family, including the matriarch who sadly departs the film due to a stroke. Among her last words are, ""I ain't snortin' no pills"" when she notices the IV in her hand. It drew a tear from my eye. This family is called by the local law enforcement ""one of the ten worst families in West Virginia"" - and the law knows it first hand.Among the relations are several (former?) prostitutes, most are drug addicts, only one - ONE! - works a proper job and he has moved from Boone County to Minneapolis to raise his brood. The young men are rutting bucks with tendencies that make them glad to compare themselves to Charles Manson; shootings, stabbings and murders are common.As an anthropologist, I saw two things here, that I think others miss: these folk are no different from their ancestors of centuries ago, and their calamities are not entirely of their own making. They do not work because all they could do is coal mine - why do that when everyone is on Social Security and Public Aid? They don't have enough money to leave, and are otherwise victimized by a puritanical system that totally discriminates against them on the basis of their family name. But it is that same ""puritanical"" system that created this community of self-admitted ""outlaw"" hillbillies.As I say, no different from the ancestors of centuries past. And lest we fail in our humanity and compassion, let us recall these folk are no different than we. We share ancestors. We would act the same way if we were in such dire straits. We, too, would be fatalist hillbillies mugging for a documentarist's camera, with hidden talents literally killing us from the inside out, and no escape.Perhaps the penetration of this documentary (at no time did I have a doubt this entire film is genuine) showed the White Family that there is a bigger world, a hopeful world. Perhaps the film is a mirror held up to the rest of us. Perhaps these folk will just have looked at the movie, laughed and gone back to their drinking, drugging and criminal lives.As for me, I like to think this educational, heartbreaking and hilarious film is one of the best of the decade. And it isn't only because I grew up with people like the Whites, or because I still have friends like them.If nothing else, it will teach you how to be a bad-ass outlaw, how to cuss better than any sailor, do pills and smoke grass. At its best, it may tug at the compassion strings in everyone's hearts."
"I must admit, on first viewing I wasn't all that impressed, in fact I had rated this thing a 4, but afterwatching it a second time, maybe with a few more beers down my neck, I love this flick and I am lauging my AO!OK, the family was crazy, but the problems with this film is that all the interesting and crazy members of thisfamily are either dead or in jail. The rest are just a bunch of redneck trailer trash pregnant women but they arepretty entertaining. I love the scene where Bertie is released from prison, goes to kidnap her husband from hisgirlfriend's house, hijacks him to the drug store where they got prescriptions for pain pills filled from thepharmacist who had originally married them. hahahahaaThis is a two hour marathon about a bunch of ignorant hicks from West Virginia. We got grandma, her daughter, anda bunch of grandkids sitting around her house smoking pot, snorting pain pills, and drinking beer they cant afford.But then how the hell do they all afford the drugs and cars cause none of them have jobs. You heard me, none of them,not one.I guess I wasn't so impressed with this insane flick cause being from Tennessee and knowing worse families, oh yeah,there's nothing here that I haven't seen before. These guys are a bunch of Pikeys compared to the Jetts, the Stinetts,Blackwells, and the Whiteheads of Marshall County. On second thought I may be a little jealous cause I wont be doingany Oxys, Roxys, Coke, or smoking any pot at my mom's house when I go home for Thanksgiving this years. LOL"
"Just, how screwed up can one family be?  This documentary seems to portray a fictional family, that is routinely involved with every degrading, unscrupulous, vindictive, vile, inhumane and disgusting trait that anyone can possess - but it's real!  You can't call this extended family &#34;the other half&#34; because &#34;the other half&#34; could never conceive of a lifestyle that barely hangs onto the threads of our collective humanity.  The Whites are, however, such an interesting and unusual mix that I was entertained, beyond belief.  I'm not particularly a Johnny Knoxville (Jackass Movies) fan but this documentary certainly kept my attention."
"Dr. Who has written the book on film/tv science fiction. And it translates well to American tastes, which doesn't always happen with British humor. Dr. Who is the Monty Python of Sci-fi!!!"
"Best Dr. Who episode ever, and the saddest. I hate to see Davd Tennant leave. A great actor, who brought a much needed emotional depth to the Doctor. With David Tennant's Doctor, you could see the Joy, Agony, sadness, anger, and sometimes the helplessness of the Doctor. The new Doctor is okay, but lacks that emotional connection, and he is a little too nerdy but not as much as the 7th Doctor. I do wish the producers had explained who the time lord women was to the Doctor?  I know some people did not like how David Tennant Doctor said ""I'am Sorry"" to those he could not help, but I think that just showed his humanity, what was he suppose to say ""Oh well, just your luck"". I for one liked his emotional attachmet."
"Many years ago, I watched Doctor Who on PBS when I could, but I lost track of The Doctor when I moved to Arkansas in 1992.Now that I've got Amazon Prime, I'm delighted to see that they have many seasons of Doctor Who, both original and rebooted series.I decided to watch the reboots first, and I'm enjoying them as much as I remember enjoying the older doctors.Though the doctors change, and the companions change, I like the way that it happens logically. I better understand how and why The Doctor regenerates, and I even understand how each of the Time Lords (back where there were more than one) chose their names, as our multiply-lived &#34;The Doctor&#34; chose his.I like the way that the producers and writers found creative ways to keep bringing back the various bad guys, and I like the way that some of the so-called villains are not always villainous, but merely seeing life from a different perspective.The nice thing about the Specials is that they have extra time to spend on the story, and in the case of the David Tennant Specials, there are &#34;Making Of&#34; episodes that are about as long as the episodes themselves.While it isn't necessary to watch the seasons and specials in any particular order, you can find complete listings of the episodes online.The copy I found shows this order for the reboot:Reboot Season One: 9th doctorReboot Season 2-3-4: 10th doctorDavid Tennant Specials: 10th doctorReboot Season 5: 11th doctorSpecial: A Christmas CarolReboot Season 6: 11th doctorSpecial: The Doctor, the Widow and the WardrobeReboot Season 7: part one (5 episodes)Special: The SnowmenReboot Season 7: part two (8 episodes)and of course, there are also Special Specials that do not fit anywhere in the timeline aboveDW: Best of the DoctorsDW: Best of the MonstersDW: Best of the CompanionsDW: Best of the Christmas SpecialsDW: The CompanionsIf you enjoy time travel, sci fi, fantasy, or just plain fun, try Doctor Who?John"
"Though these were the last of 10's reign as the Doctor, they were done SO well.  I started watching again with #9 Chris Eccleston.  He was FANTASTIC (hehe) definitely a warrior, but with a soft spot just big enough for Rose Tyler to enter.  After his regeneration into #10 (Tennant) you see the warrior remain, but with more of a loving side.  Tennant's range of emotion, his depiction of a complex character who must travel alone, but longs for companionship - is just hands down incredible.  I don't think there was one episode where I didn't wind up tearing a little by episodes end.  You gotta love a Time Lord with a passionate love for humanity.  Doctor Who #10 is Brilliant!"
These episodes are some of the best of the David Tennant Doctor Who series.  I love all the cheeky humor.
The David Tennant specials are a loving celebration and a heartfelt farewell salute to the most endearing Doctor EVER.Must see. Must love.  Must own!
"I have been a friend of Doctor Who for a long time. In his specials, he works people other than his normal partners.  This makes more spoilers to be tried and succeed or fail."
This andDreamlandfit between what Amazon calls seasons 4 and 5.These are absolutely beautiful to watch (in HD) and David Tennant is wonderful in all these episodes.  Planet of the Dead is a great stand alone story.  Even though the final episode feels a bit forced (as they try to cram as many guest appearances as possible...) the overall story resolution is pretty amazing.  So while this was a very short season it is totally enjoyable.
Top notch shows with excellent acting and superb special effects. We enjoy watching and rewatching each one of these specials.
excellent shows - love how the specials add to the story lines. Tennant is of course fabulous. also like they they are all christmas related.
These specials are fun and a great filler that helps answer a few of the questions about gaps in the regular series. Love the Dr.
"I always enjoy David T. performances as the Dr. His co-stars add to the story line quite well. I do wish that we could bring him back as a guest or a sort of flash back, maybe a brother???.."
excellent excellant.  david did a marvalous job. of carrying his part.  billie was a smart move.  i hope she included in futuresegments.  i will be viewing all segments a i finish one and go tothe next one.
I think that the 2 part End of Time specials are some of the best episodes written by Russel T Davies. I loved the Master and was happy to see him back and crazier than ever.
David Tennant is my favorite Doctor!  Plus the shows in the special are all leading up to the end of Doctor #10.  An awesome set in the series.
"Always enjoyable, David Tennant as the doctor is fun witty and nutters. Nice to be able to watch episodes that netflix didn't include."
Ever since I was young I have enjoyed watching Dr Who and now my son and I watch it together.
David Tennant is my favorite all time Doctor! I absolutely enjoyed each minute of  these episodes. I'll be very happy to see him return in the 50th anniversary special!
"Soft, tender and beautifully restrained, `Ondine' is a magical film that left me feeling a warmth in my bones I hadn't felt walking out of a theater in quite a while.  I have been anxiously awaiting this films opening for some time now, beings that I had first read of it last year, but it wasn't until about a month ago that it opened in my neck of the woods and I dragged the wife down to one of those posh `Independent' theaters that I love so much to see this `adult fairytale' for myself.I was simply captivated.The film centers around a lost soul (well, quite a few of them actually) who have to come to terms with circumstance and situation, all of which dampen their existence.  Syracuse is a reformed alcoholic fisherman who struggles to care for his handicapped daughter (the poor girls suffers from kidney failure) while battling his ex-wife and her new man, both of whom are still heavy drinkers.  One morning Syracuse sees something strange in his net; a woman.  She insists that he tell no one of her whereabouts, and so he allows her to stay in his mother's home (she's deceased).  Syracuse's daughter stumbles upon this mysterious woman (who goes by the name Ondine, which means `she came from the sea') and instantly believes that she is a selkie, a sea-woman who wears a seal coat and is allowed to come to land and live for seven years if she sheds seven tears, buries her seal-coat and falls in love with a lands-man (it's Celtic myth, and I may have got it a tad wrong so correct me if you feel the need).  Regardless of what or who Ondine is, it is instantly apparent that she is very good for both Annie and Syracuse, and they are good for her as well.  You can see them come out of the depression that circles their lives and begin to live, spirits uplifted and futures bright.Until...Well, I don't think it would be too telling to state that not all is as it seems and dark secrets are bound to come to the light.`Ondine' is a beautiful film to look at, complete with stunning cinematography that still maintains a gritty authenticity that lets you know this is not your typical glossed over fairytale.  The Polish actress Alicja Bachleda (who looks like a Victoria's Secret model) is obviously well liked by the director (who can blame him) and so he effortlessly frames her, but without every once coming across as offensive or tacky.  She's beautiful, but not at the cost of the films internal integrity.The film has a very tender center, one that beautifully captures the rawness of human longing and the desire to put our pasts behind us.Performance-wise, this film is very strong.  I've always been a fan of Colin Farrell (so underrated as an actor) and I absolutely love what he's been doing with his career over the past few years.  That Golden Globe win for `In Bruges' (how dare the Academy snub him!) was just the beginning, and `Ondine' marks yet another pure, grounded and unforgettable performance by the Irish stunner.  He breathes such depth of despair into Syracuse's bones, giving him a rough yet endearing quality that makes us want to comfort him and alleviate his troubles.  This is easily the best performance I've seen so far this year (granted, I have not seen a lot).  Stephen Rea (who stunned in another Neil Jordan masterpiece, `The Crying Game') delivers a delightfully subtle supporting turn as the cheeky Priest who knows Syracuse all too well, and Alicja Bachleda sizzles with commanding strength as that mysterious sea-beauty.  Alison Barry delivers a smart performance, once that capitalizes on youth in all the right ways and I think one that was necessary in carrying the audience off into her fantastical beliefs.In the end, `Ondine' is a marvelous film that I highly recommend to all.  There are few films that offer such refreshingly unique viewpoints and that flourish with originality within prose (my only balk is at the clich&eacute;d way in which the `obvious' villain is introduced, but it's a very minor complaint) that ignoring this film would be a travesty for any and every movie lover."
I enjoyed the acting and the story. A fairy tale mixed with mystery. It takes  on  an old fairy tale and updates it.
"According to the dictionary an 'ondine is a water nymph or water spirit, the elemental of water. They are usually found in forest pools and waterfalls. They have beautiful voices, which are sometimes heard over the sound of water. According to some legends, ondines cannot get a soul unless they marry a man and bear him a child. This aspect has led them to be a popular motif in romantic and tragic literature.'  Another bit of background information that aids the viewer of this little rarity of a film, ONDINE, is the bit of folklore often referred to in the film - that Ondine is a 'selkie': 'In Irish folklore, there are many stories about creatures who can transform themselves from seals to humans.  These beings are called selkies.  The seals would come up onto rocks or beaches and take off their skins, revealing the humans underneath.  There is no agreement among the stories of how often they could make this transformation.  Some say it was once a year on Midsummer's Eve, while others say it could be every ninth night.  Once ashore, the selkies were said to dance and sing in the moonlight. One of the most common themes found in selkie folklore is romantic tragedy.  Selkie women were supposed to be so beautiful that no man could resist them.  They were said to have perfect proportions and dark hair.  They also made excellent wives.  For this reason, one of the most common selkie stories is that of a man stealing a selkie woman's sealskin.  Without her skin, she cannot return to the sea, and so she marries the human man and has children with him.  She is a good wife and mother, but because her true home is in the sea, she always longs for it.  In the stories, she ends up finding her sealskin that her husband has hidden, or one of her children unwittingly finds it and brings it to her.  According to legend, once a selkie find her skin again, neither chains of steel nor chains of love can keep her from the sea.  She returns to the ocean, usually leaving her children behind with their grief-stricken father'.All of this information may seem redundant, but when a beautiful little film such as ONDINE, written and directed by the always excellent Neil Jordan, knowing the background helps support the manner in which the story is told and revealed.  Syracuse (Colin Farrell) is a recovering alcoholic fisherman whose alcoholic wife has custody of his beloved daughter Annie (Allison Barry) who because of renal failure must be dialyzed frequently and spend her days in a motorized wheelchair while she awaits a kidney transplant.  Syracuse focuses his life on Annie - until one day while fishing he brings up a beautiful girl in his nets, a frightened girl named Ondine (Alicja Bachleda, a brilliant Polish actress and singer from Mexico) who fears being seen by anyone.  Syracuse protects and clothes her and secludes her in his dead mothers shack by the sea - until Annie discovers her, having researched everything she could fine at the library about the selkies.  Annie decides Ondine is  selkie who must bury her seal coat in the earth and thus gain seven years on land without having return to the sea.  With this mixture of myth and reality the story moves along at a gentle pace: Syracuse frequents the priest (Stephen Rea) confessional (his only available semblance of an AA stabilizer in his small village), Annie and Ondine bond, Syracuse and Ondine fall in love (despite the myth's warning that every selkie has a husband), and the townsfolk begin to accept the strange happiness that has returned to Syracuse's heart. The plot then twists and the realities of the myth become known and the story progresses from a  recreation of a mythical romance to the difficulties of a true romance.The chemistry between Farrell and Bachleda and Farrell and Barry is extraordinary and palpable: they make the film sing.  The haunting musical score is by Kjartan Sveinsson and the moody cinematography is by Christopher Doyle.  Neil Jordan pulls all of these elements together into a film that will linger in memory - like the song Ondine sings.  There have been novels, operas, ballets, and plays written based on this myth, but few capture its mystery the way this film does.  It is a quiet little gem of art.  Grady Harp, June, 10"
Colin Farrell was incredible. I love this film. It was a great whimsical film. Kept you engaged. Would recommend to a friend.
I SO LOVE THIS MOVIE! THERE WAS JUST SOMETHING ABOUT IT. EVERYONE HAS THEIR OPINION BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AND THINK IT'S AWESOME!
"I love Irish movies.  They are strength, humor, romance and pure.  Oops, I forgot bold, origonal and art.  Watch it only when you don't have something else on your mind.  My five stars are honest from that space..."
"In this modern day world of computers, Facebook, Tweeters ,Etc. , Imagination is slowly becoming passe.  Fantasy films are still being made with the CGI effect as a safety net but many of them have expunged the 'Once Upon A Time' otherworldly feeling one should experience becoming one with the tale. Writer/director Neil Jordan has resurrected the 'Once Upon A Time' once again by unleashing a modern day fairytale on a jaded film going audience.  He did it once before with his excellent film 'THE COMPANY OF WOLVES' and now does it with 'ONDINE' the most beautiful, mesmerizing piece of cinema released this past year. The Irish countryside is far more breathtaking than a computerized backdrop.  By combining myths with modern day alienation from human roots, Jordan spins a tale of a fisherman who is barely getting by in his small Irish town.  Separated from his wife and father to a dying little girl, his paralysed existence is shattered when one day he catches a beautiful woman in his fishing net.  While trying to separate the myth-(his little girl thinks the woman is a Selkie- a seal creature of Scottish legend) from reality, he hopelessly falls in love and cannot cope with the good fortune that comes his way.  Naturally, a big bad wolf arrives to throw a wrench in the proceedings. Colin Farrell continues to show us what a wonderful thespian he truly is and Alicia Bacheleda is intoxicating as the strange woman.  The scene stealer is Alison Barry as the little girl, Annie, who's presence is felt throughout the proceedings even when not on screen. There is nothing more shattering than a child supporting a parent based on the sheer courage and unwavering faith in the enormity of this love and gift that came from the sea.  With breathtaking photography by Christopher Doyle and an ethereal music score combining traditional Irish ballads, 'ONDINE' is a jewel among the countless remakes and sequels being unleashed on the cinema going public.  As one critic from the Minneapolis Star Tribune stated "" ONDINE is so good that it hurts"".  I couldn't have said it better myself."
My Granddaughter cannot get enough of these guys. It keeps her entertained and she gets the idea about playing with others.
We have watched Yo Gabba Gabba in our home for several years & all 3 of my children love the show. I like it because they learn as they watch. It might come across as corny to us adults but the kids love it & that's what matters.
"I am a mom, and I think that I am way more into this show than my 3 year old son!!! The music is so great and the interaction the characters have with the audience is great. I love the fact that they teach lessons that kids can use in everyday life. Especially when it comes to then starting pre-school. I will continue to watch all the other seasons."
Strictly for my grand kids.  It gets their attention every time..  They are 3 and 1 year old and  they dance along with the music.
"Show is great, our kiddo loves it - and it deserves 5 stars. What sucks is that both Seasons 1 & 2 used to be free with Prime, but once Amazon secured all the Nick Jr shows that used to be on Netflix, they now moved Season 2 to a purchase rather than free stream. Also, Season 1 shows to be a Prime option on my computer, but on my PS3s and on Roku, it only shows up as a purchase option. what's up with that?"
"7 month old grand son jumped, & smiled the whole time that Yo Gabba Gabba was on~he doesn't watch much TV , but this show was perfect for him."
I downloaded these videos for my two year old grandson who was in the hospital for a few days.  I allowed him to watch them on my kindle while I worked on my laptop.  Watching these took his mind off of being sick and made our stay much more tolerable.
make these prime? PLEASE! these are the best shows. they are crazy and trippy but they send a wonderful message to kids!
The children love the show.  They get bright-eyed when they hear the music start up.  It's a great show for the young ones.
My toddler granddaughter loves this show!  Luckily there are enough episodes in a single season to rotate through without repeating too often.
It is like a variety show for kids that allows them to learn about all kinds of music and diversity.
This is a great show for young children.  It teaches some really simple lessons without any undesirable agendas attached.  It has quickly grown into a &#34;classic&#34;.
"One of the ONLY shows my daughter will watch. It's between this, Mickey Mouse, and her colors-and-shapes DVD. Our favorite is the Halloween episode."
I'm a nanny an the 7 month old I watch loves this show. Every time it starts he gets so happy an jumps in his jumparoo. They took it off prime and that was a mess of a couple weeks please don't take it off again.
"I really like the music, concepts and the colors. The imaginative creators and producers always have a positive message to convey. I find this show to be good for 2 to 4 year olds. DJ Lance and his crew Rock....."
"My daughter was really into this when she was maybe 2.  She has since moved on to Doc McStuffins and Sofia the First.  I sadly, have not.  It's very reminiscent of an 80's video game with good music.  The Halloween episode is particularly great."
The show is fantastic! All of our kids love watching it over and over. There is almost nothing that can get our two year old to sit still and be completely attentive like Yo Gaba Gaba.
"Unfortunately Netflix quit showing this and it is our 2 year old son's favorite show, so we got it on Amazon thankfully so he could enjoy his favorite show again.  Thank you Amazon!"
My kids love the show and want to watch it all the time. My sons favorite and he has the stuffed animals.
"I'm going to give this show 5 stars, because I love it! Not only do I love this show, my 18 month old daughter loves it too! She recites the movie from front to back! This show is a lot of fun to watch, and I like the fact that it teaches young children manners. I will recommend this show to families with children, ages 0 and up. Lol. I'm 30 and I'll watch this show over and over."
I wish they would get more seasons up of Yo Gabba Gabba. The kids love it! Netflix used to have 2 seasons
"My two grandbabies love these guys. They perk up and give it their full attention.  &#34;More please&#34;, they will say."
When I came home from work and saw this show on my TV I nearly fell out.  I mean what the heck was that big red marital aid doing on the TV singing and dancing.  Then I realized it wa a kid's show.  My bad. DJ Lance Rock is a bit to take as well but once you settle in the show is actually pretty good.  You just have to go with it.
"This is where it all began...I'm not the one who loves this show. My child does.I imagine it is a modern version of Sesame Street,focusing on music, art, and social skills.Young children understand that it's silly and funny.So, it's now a part of our pop culture."
YGG is the best. Both of my grandkids love it. We have all of the stuffed characters too. Destined to be a childrens classic.
"We love Yo Gabba Gabba, and Season 1 is super.  My daughter is getting a little older but still turns it on once in a while to watch it again.  My nephew is crazy for it.  Great for kids of all ages."
My toddler luvs to dance and sing along with the yo gabba gabba gang. Cool tricks! Cool tricks! Go crazy!
"This is a really good humored and kind of timeless comedy of teen aged angst and rights of passage.  The last episode, &#34;Is it college yet&#34; strikes a chord in me.  This is just good, fun television."
I love this show!  It's intelligent and funny.  Daria's character is so sarcastic and pessimistic but at the same time she does struggle with doing the right thing.  For a cartoon character she seems remarkably human.
Daria rocks. This season is no different. i really enjoyed wathcing this series again as an adult. I definitely ddnt get the sarcasm & humor that was going on wen i first watched it as a kid! Don't forget the movie at the end!
"I have the same sense of humor, and saw the world in the same way when I was in high school. I was the definite outcast. Ifonly there would have been a Daria in my day!  I watch one of these almost every night, and have for over a year. It never disappoints me. Consistent light at heart entertainment."
"This show hits all the right notes.  Each character is unique, eccentric yet lovable.  The humor is quirky and we particularly like trying to acquaint our ear with the Welsh accent."
"The story line has developed nicely since the scene was set in season 1.  The romance between Gavin (from London, England) and Stacy (from Barry, Wales) has blossomed into marriage.  All the characters have been fleshed out fully.  Each role has been well cast.  Much of the humor plays off the idiosyncrasies of being English versus Welsh.  It's all done in good fun and it's great entertainment."
"Once again, I'm jealous of the UK and their great programming! This is a well written series, with a great cast to back it up. I'm sad to see it end."
...but it's worth it.  What a hilarious crew of characters!  I really love this show.  And there's the benefit of learning so much  British slang.  The episodes are &#34;crackin'&#34; and &#34;tidy&#34; and &#34;brilliant.&#34;
"Season 3, the last season of Gavin and Stacey, is the unfortunate end of a great situation comedy.  Not since the best addictive television comedies like Seinfeld and Cheers before it, has there been such a show worthy of a dedicated following--and sadly America doesn't even know about it. I just happened upon Gavin and Stacey and after a couple shows, I watched 3 seasons of it in 3 days. The best aspect of this show is that there are truly talented actors who wholly inhabit their characters.  The most annoying, off-putting, characteristic of any show for me, particularly a comedy, is when an actor is constantly aware of what he's doing--the audience is watching him act.  His/her, ego is on full display completely thrilled at this opportunity to strut his stuff in a show.  That doesn't happen in Gavin and Stacey.  Some of these characters are over the top, and you believe them, even love them for their idiosyncrasies.  Gavin and Stacey are two very nice people, who you might know.  They are genuine and sweet and innocently funny.  But the characters that surround them--their families and friends--are straight-up crazy, funny, flawed, sweet, loving, honest people--just like your aunts, uncles and friends.  Pam, Gavin's mom, so mom-ish--loving her prince of a son, sexy with her husband, sometimes trying to be who she isn't, giving and selfish, fussy and warm--is simply funny.  Smithy, Gavin's best friend, is somewhat rotund, cutting back on his eating with a 6-pack of chicken, corn on the cob and other sides, at the end of a night of partying; always greets Gavin with a shared hip-hop song and choreography--with Gav's mom and dad joining in when they're around--quite capably, I might add; rolling on the floor in a tussle with his younger sister--another hip-hop master; and, an all-round hysterically funny good guy!  Brin, Stacey's uncle is embodied by Rob Brydon, of The Trip...OMG, I adore him... Brin lingers just a minute too long when he hugs Gav, and he is harboring some secret experience...that happened on a fishing trip with his nephew, Stacey's brother...it was very cold on that trip... And, last but certainly not least, Nessa, Stacey's best friend.  Nessa is a hearty (like Smithy) Welsh lady, who is completely blunt in her honest, slightly stilted, take on the world.  She can assist her bouncer friends at the local night club, and go head-to-head with Smithy on a KFC mega meal, where a butter-dripping ear of corn becomes an unexpected bit of foreplay.  The only thing that an American audience might take a bit of getting used to are the British and Welsh accents...but please, give it a minute...the Welsh accents become another great joke.  This only negative about this comedy is that there are not 5 more seasons to hang out with these people.  This is a great, funny and very warm ensemble show."
One of the funniest series ever...don't miss it! I keep coming back to it so I can enjoy the great one-liners & Welsh expressions.
"True to the British form-short and sweet.  I would love to have more, but better that all of it was so good!"
"Awesomely written and presented.  This is so hilarious, I laughed until my sides hurt.  You have to love and appreciate the humor from a dry perspective.  I still cannot get enough."
"I loved this show when it was originally aired. I love it today even more though. Simply Delightful. a must see, all 3 seasons."
"The final season (YES...ONLY 3!!! WAKE UP BBC!) is fantastic. While we never actually find out what happened on the now infamous fishing trip, we still feel like we are in a good place with all concerned. If this show does get legs in its American version, I do hope Ruth Jones takes a very active hand and perhaps allows us to learn more about Nessa. She is the lynch pin of the show. You never know what will come out of her mouth and G & S fans were treated to some cameos that perhaps American viewers might not have picked up on. Again, it will be fun to see how it pulls off in the States if it ever gets off the ground."
"Backyardigans is a very innocent show for young children.  It lacks the subtle double entendre of some cartoons but it's good to have a resource that is just nice.  It is more than suitable for my littler guys and I never feel a need to monitor their viewing or censor any of it.  But the best part is the music.  I've never really thought of children's fare in terms of the music before but this shows what can be done in the right hands.  Perhaps it isn't for everyone, but my kids really enjoy singing along.  Bang up job, guys!"
"My son is 10.  He has gotten the whole family watching this series - it's pretty awesome.  Great world-building, characters, buy-in.  I'm a big fan myself, now.  Recommend for all ages."
"I'm a grandmother of five, and I enjoy the Backyardigans as much as my grandchildren!!!  They remind me of how much fun kids can have when they use their imaginations."
"I put this on for the grandkids but I must confess that I tend to like the music on this one,too."
"My kids (3 & 15 months) love this show. It's got great music. Granted, the 15 month old doesn't really have the attention span for TV, but he looks over during the songs and shakes his little bootie. All very tame, nothing TOO scary, but still adventurous. The music is great as is the animation. A favorite in our house."
My 4 year old loves this show. It is very creative and keeps his attention. The five friends use their imagination as they play in their backyards.
Ever since my son was a baby he's loved this show.
"The Backyardigans is a great show that focuses on the brilliant creativity of kids' play. The fantastic music is always a hit and the stories often have a subtle lesson in manners, sportsmanship and addressing misunderstandings."
"Nice music, no fighting, no enemies.  I am glad my son enjoys this show! I like this better than bey-blades and Power Rangers."
Fun filled energetic characters that really keep my children's attention . The problem solving and musical soundtracks keep them entertained
"One of my grandkids favorite series. It is friendly, musical, and helps children imagine what the can do in their back yards. Wonderful series!"
"Always on the lookout for quality children's programming for our family, my wife and I fell in love with this show.  I think I like watching it even more than the kids.  We typically stick with educational shows, which I do not believe this would fall into, but consider this to be a quality show.In addition to its innocence, this show is full of great songs and really encourages imagination.  It is very well thought out, with sub plots of each episode neatly relating to one another and all tying together.This is GREAT stuff!"
"My kids love The Backyardigans. The songs are catchy, and I don't mind listening to them in the car. Who goes there? Who goes there? Who goes...who goes there?"
"Both my girls, 3 and 4 love the Backyardigans and having them available to watch anytime in Prime membership is fantastic. Recommend to parents with young children."
My granddaughter loves this show. This is her bedtime routined story for us to share each night. Very nice stories that teach and imagination is used in a good way.
both my sons loved it. Very good story lines with music and fun stuff appropriate for the kids. I wish they had more than 4 seasons.
"The song they sing &#34;GO GO GO GO GO!&#34; from Race Around the World episode is part of her &#34;new talker&#34; repertoire. When they sing it...she sings it. It's very cute that among her first dozen words or so...she pulls many from songs that she hears, like some of the ones the Backyardigans sing."
Our son LOVES this show.  The songs are catchy and the stories are amusing and fun!  Definitely recommend for children.
Singing our way through play! We enjoy Backyardigans for its creativity through make believe and song. A wonderful show for kids!
One of our three year old 's favorite shows. We enjoy every episode over and over. Great happy campers are we
My grandson loves the Backyardigans.  He sings the songs and dances around while watching.  I enjoy watching the episodes with him as they are very entertaining.
These characters imagine they are somewhere or doing something then they break into some great song. When my children were three to five they watched this show to many times to count. They have moved on now but I think that is because they have watched it so many times. This is a good show with good themes for children.
"The Wonder Pets is such a cute show. Linny, Tuck, & Ming Ming are the best. My son loves the songs and all the adventures."
this is so much fun and i love it. the kids seem to like it too. we should have started watching this sooner.
This teaches nice social behavior as well as the goodness in helping others. &#34;this is seweious&#34; is my sons favorite line.
"My 2 year old twins love this program.  Since each episode is really two short stories combined that can be viewed separately, it affords us the ability to watch them separately so they are not watching too long art a time. They love role playing wonder pets saving their stuffed animals while they play."
Even 'I' like it!  Great for 18-36 month olds.
"My little girl LOVES this show!  These animals save living things while singing about it.  The trills are a bit repetitive, which may prove slightly trying for adults inspires my little girl - she LOVES this show!!!  Plus, there's great learning to discuss with relationships.  A catch phrase is &#34;What's going to work?  Team work!&#34;  Overall, this is a great show: imaginative, thoughtful, and offers great opportunities to have discussions with your child."
I was first introduced to this tv show by my nieces when they were young and 3 years later I have my own son who watches this show.  He loves it.  The songs are cute and catchy and the episodes are not long either.Teaches the skills of working as a team and helping one another....highly recommend.
My two year old really loves this show.  Even my seven year old likes to watch them.  It teaches team work.
This series works well in holding the attention of toddlers and preschoolers. I like it simply because it doesn't display violence and is very age appropriate.
My grandson love the Wonder Pets and I just love listening to him sing with the episodes!  I definitely recommend for toddlers.
"This series is very good for young kids to learn about lots of things.  The Wonder Pets help other animals solve problems like being brave, getting lost, etc.  They stress the importance of team work.  This show is fun and easy to watch (not too flashy)."
The show is great.  But my granddaughter ordered this automatically without my permission.  I have since learned how to block ordering.  All she had to do was press watch this now - and I payed
"I have a 9 year old son.  We used to watch this series when he was younger - it was one of our favorites.  Recently, he began watching them again with our prime video subscription.  We both enjoy it as much as ever."
"Very lively and wondrous. I don't mean to sound like an advertisement, but it really does bring on the smiles and giggles."
My kids love the backyardigans and have watched them for years. I think it's a good show teaching kids how to use their imagination. We can go anywhere we dream of going!
The Backyardagain's catchy tunes and fun adventures definitely entertain my 3 year old and my 16 month old dances to the music.
"The second season is just as great as the first. More imaginative, creative playtime with five friends. My 4 year old loves this show. He will &#34;act&#34; out the episode after he is finished watching."
"Great show!!  My kids, 7 and 4 years old love this show and have been watching it for a while.  Fuels their imaginations with positive play!"
Grandkids love it.
This is my 6 year olds absolute favorite and I can't argue. Their theme of &#34;we have the whole wide world&#34; is a testament to the wonderment of stretching a child's imagination. In every episode they step into their backyard and let their minds go. There is always something to learn.  There is also infectious music (my favorite is the space song by Alicia Keyes) and these Backyardigans have got to be the best dancing cartoons characters ever.
Backyardigans are all great. I have my favorites and my kids do as well. Not too bad on multiple viewings either.
My grandkids love watching this on the Kindle.  It's wonderful to get an entire season of episodes for them to enjoy.
Both my 4 and 3 year olds love being able to watch these episodes anytime. Even though they have watched them a thousand times. Recommend to parents of small children.
both my sons love it. They are age appropriate with good music and story-line. The characters are funny and lovely.
"My kids love to watch, sing and dance with the Backyardigans.  Teaches imagination skills and teamwork.  Helps kids explore past the back yard."
I don't watch it personally but I hear the theme song every time my daughter has the kindle. That means a lot because she's very picky on her shows. I Love the songs. Once in a while I would glance in it and see cute characters. Its good for little kids. Cleaner than sponge Bob. I would totally recommend it to those that have little ones.
My three year old and fourteen month old can't get enough.  Very colorful and well done for the youngster.  Highly recommended!
My grandson loves The Backyardigans so much that I have purchased several of their CDs.  The singing and dancing is wonderful and so entertaining for the toddlers as well as us adults!
"Lots of fun for the little ones! Great animation, music, dancing and engaging story lines. Keeps them all  well entertained"
We sing many of the songs we've learned from here throughout the day. My son loves to see what adventure they will go on enxt.
"my 5 year old great grandson loves this program and watches it constantly.  It is well done and the music is fantastic.I would recommend this to everyone, young and old.  They are sooo enjoyable."
"Cute, cute, cute. The young'uns love this program and the adults can easily find humor and enjoy watching along."
This is a great positive kids show with good educational episodes. Amazons scheduling of this show is one of the reasons I signed up for Prime.
"My 5 yr old and twin 2 yr olds love this show, very imaginative and entertaining!! Educational as well, love it!"
My grandkids love watching this on the Kindle.  It's wonderful to get an entire season of episodes for them to enjoy.  Robot Rampage is their favorite.
"My 3 year old loves loves loves Backyardigans and she will watch this over and over again. Great for me and her,,,! This will keep her quiet long enough for me to make phone calls."
"Great show, we have seen every season and it is always a show that is teaching values that kids need to know"
It is an amazing series of small episodes. Both my kids love watching it. Hope to see few more seasons.
My son loves all the episodes in this season. It's the best one! I just wish amazon would make all of them available.
my great grandson loves these guys.  the episodes are well done with exceptional music.i recommend this video to any parent or grandparent.
"Kids love the characters, storyline, and the music. I, the adult, totally love the music!! I'm surprised the kids dance to the music because they are a pop/hip pop generation. The music is often jazzy, or blues its so cool. This is a really nice series, no hitting or bad words-important-toddlers reinact or copy everything. Certain shows I can't let them watch because they really model bad behavior, I don't have to worry about this with the Backyardigans. All the characters are equal, looks and gender are not an issue in this forward thinking show."
"""My Sara Jane"" when the Doctor spoke those words, I wanted to echo them. Sara Jane was my companion to the Doctor's of my youth. Not only did I get to see Sara Jane again but also K-9, along with the the best doctor of all time. But this episode was so sad in how the Doctor explained leaving Companions behind "" You can live your whole life with me, but I can't live my whole life with you"" And for the Doctor, who has seen his world, his family and his friends all parish, seeing his special companions die is just too much to bear. I sometimes wonder how he continues to go on? I was very happy to see Miss Sladen in several more episodes of the Doctor and to see Doctor's 10 and 11 do cross over episodes with her on her show. But now that the Great Lady has died, I will truly miss her."
"The season starts out with a bang, and follows through all the way to the end of the season. Rose continues to work well with the Doctor."
"Really, really enjoyed it. Good writing. Clever plots. Liked the way events and sometimes characters reappeared subtly in later episodes."
"David Tennant rocks. I love his version of the doctor. He 's able to show more emotion than is usual in this character,"
"I was a fan of the show as a young girl, and had resisted seeing the new edition of Dr. Who for some time.  Now, 8 years after its birth to our new television viewing audience, I can see what all the fuss is about.  It took me a day and a half to watch the first season, and if how quickly I viewed those episodes is ANY indicator of my opinion on the show - well, lets just say I am HOOKED!  I was sad to see Eccleston (The 9th Dr.) go so quickly after only one season, but Tennant as the regenerated 10th Doctor was a surprise I was not expecting.  The writing by Russell T. Davies is exceptional!  This storyteller weaves a tale that is a tasty mix of old Sci-Fi, fun new worlds and new characters, and a touching love for humanity and hope.  Tennant's range of emotion in a character who could have been hardened by time, has a love for the Planet earth that can never be explained.  Everything is new, and the things in the world that could be perceived as odd or frightening or dangerous, he sees with the eyes of a scientist saying things like &#34;You're MAGNIFICENT! and Just look at YOU - you're BEAUTIFUL!&#34;  Additionally, like every lonely traveller, the Dr. needs a companion who he finds in the more common part of London.  The lovely Rose Tyler proves to be more than a pretty face.  Born with a spirit for adventure, this couple makes traveling the universe fun and exciting.  And of course....what unsuspecting young girl wouldn't fall in love with such a lonely yet exciting man of the universe.Though some of the special effects are a bit cheesy, that seems to have always been the basis of the 'fun' in the show since the '60's.  I can't say enough about how much I have enjoyed watching the second, third and fourth seasons of Dr. Who.  The departure of Russell T. Davies as lead writer and David Tennant as the Dr. were indeed a sad loss for the show.Rating - DEFINITELY SEE THIS SEASON...."
"I've been a fan of Doctor Who since the 70's and I never thought another Doctor could out-charm actor, Tom Baker.  But David Tennant is a wonder - simply the BEST.  Must see.  Repeatedly.  So must own!"
Packed with action adventure through time and space Dr Who rocks and will not be dissapointing through all seasons.  I'm hooked for life!!!
"I have no idea, but they did it! David Tennant is BRILLIANT! He may not be the best-looking actor in the world (so say many of my teen and twenties friends), but his talent and the character of the Doctor make him the sexiest! I think he's gorgeous! His interaction with Billie Piper is breathtaking and even though I despise chick-flicks and romance type stories, I think the love story between the Doctor and Rose is the most emotion-grabbing I have ever experienced. I hate to admit it, but I cried... more than once! and so did my hubby, and all our college aged friends!"
"*SPOILERS!*This is my favorite Doctor Who season and the chemistry between the tenth Doctor (David Tennant) and Rose Tyler (played by Billie Piper) is outstanding.  I love watching them sing the theme to Ghostbusters, laugh together, and when Rose is possessed during a trip to the hospital, watching her throw herself at the Doctor for a kiss and he seems completely startled but as she walks off he mumbles  ""Yep, still got it.""  XD  David/Billie - you guys are awesome!Season 2 is a must for Doctor Who fans."
"You ever need to fel better anout the human race watch this, it makes you remmeber why life is good"
We have gotten hooked on Who and season two is a big one with the love interest of Rose Tyler at play. We highly recommend it!
"If you have not seen Doctor Who, you are missing out on a piece of culture, not just a great show."
"By far my favorite season so far.. Tennant is my favorite Doctor, and i love the relationship he has with Rose."
Love this series.  Takes me away from any mundane work!
"These episodes no longer have &#34;Robert Ecland&#34; as a character, but his replacement still performs in the same manner and is maintaining the enjoyable quality of the series."
"This is a very, very intelligent show. I thoroughly enjoyed every episode in this series. I'm certian I will watch it all over again."
"I have watched Dr. Who since it started, and really became involved when Tom Baker became the Dr.  I have liked them all,and I think David Tennant is definitely one of the best.  If I think about it calmly, I see some problems arise as far as the outlandish way the Dr. Saves the world every time, but frankly, why look at it calmly. It is a wonderful modern fairy tale, and that is just the way I like it.  The actors are usually very good too.  I especially like Alex Kingston as River Song. A wonderful show which I have enjoyed having in my life for early 50 years."
"I am an old fan of the original series that first started watching in the mid to late 70's in the USA. I was heartbroken when the Doctor Who series was taken off the air for good back in the late 80's. My  children were starting to grow up with it by then. I was never able to see the Movie made in the 90's to bring it back but . . . have not been at all disappointed by this re-introductions to the series. The second session is just as much a hit as the first with me. A new Doctor with a new persona but with all the &#34;old&#34; to go with it. Whether this is the first time you have watched Doctor Who or you are an old fan like me, you will be swept away by the &#34;Mad Man in the Blue Box.&#34;"
"I was a little skeptical after the fist season ended since Christopher Eccleston was no longer going to be The Doctor.  I really loved him.  But, since I had become a fan of the series, I decided to give the 2nd season a try, starting with the Christmas episode...David Tennant's first episode.I am so glad I gave it a try!  David Tennant's interpretation of the 10th Doctor is superb.  He is great fun to watch.  If you are not sure about this season, give this episode a try ... you won't be sorry!"
Didn't think I was going to like the &#34;new&#34; doctor...BUT I DO.  I think its great that the writers are developing the characters
I love the way the English focus more on personality and less on physical perfection. It allows my whole family to enjoy this timeless classic and are fans for life.
It was my first introduction to Dr Who and it opens the door for many more. It was a good episode.
I chose this rating because it gave me something that I was missing in the everyday tv shows. The relationships are magnetic and Doctor Who is so charming and it makes you feel apart of the adventure!This is for everyone!
"Great stories, characters, and plots. Even better than the original series that ran on PBS back in the eighties !"
"My grandchildren are so fond of this classic retelling of the Dr. Who series!  I used to watch the old ones with their mother, and now they look forward to it with the same enthusiasm.  It's great to have something they are excited about that the adults in the family do not dread!"
These two make a great combo!! I love David Tennent as the tenth doctor and i love the chemistry between him and rose aka Billie piper
"As Season 2 opens, the Doctor has transformed into a new body, played by my favorite Doctor, David Tennant.  Rose is trying to adjust to the fact that the man who saved her life has a new body & the Doctor is needed before he's fully evolved, to defend London from mad Santa's & evil Christmas trees.  The Doctor/Rose bond has been well-established & Rose & her family help to defend the Doctor until he awakes fully renewed.  Lots of adventure & like Season 1, you have to love the Doctor!Great BBC series, with fantastic aliens, travel to far-away places in the Tardis, interesting problems & the companionship of Rose & the Doctor.  I recommend this series as one of the best!"
"I've watched on standard TV, my computer and now a large HD TV, and he just keeps getting better. The ability of both Tennant and &#34;Rose&#34; to convey deep conflicts and feelings is stunning. And the stories hold up well enough to watch repeatedly, always finding something new to enjoy. (The Christopher Eggleston episodes are very well done, too, but my preference will always be David Tennant.)"
"I've enjoyed every show I've seen.  I was afraid I wouldn't like it when they changed the Doctor's character, but I just love it.  It's family entertainment that's fun."
"I was not ready for a new Doctor and did not expect to like him but David Tennant is fantastic - I wonder if there can ever be another Dr Who to compare with him.  Rose was the perfect companion for him and the chemistry was compelling. The story lines, the characters and the special effects make this Series outstanding."
"This is a great show, but I do not get the BBC channel out here in the sticks where I live so my Amazon Prime membership is perfect for me to watch all the shows I love but never get to see on TV. Now with Amazon Prime I can watch through my PC in my bed room, my Wii on my Family Room TV, and my son has an internet ready TV that he can watch what he wants on. I love this show and I love love love my Amazon Prime membership."
"We are big fans of this series.  Just love the stories, the acting & writing is wonderful.Waiting on the next showing in Nov."
The perfect part for the perfect actor.  David Tennant pulls you in to the plot with believable realistic talent that comes natural to him even when a facial expression is all that is needed.
"I had never seen Doctor Who before this year. I was browsing instant videos and thought I would see why this show has been so popular for so many years. I have now watched seasons 1 through 4 (of the new series) and have started season 5. I love this show.Travelling through time with the Doctor and his companion is a real treat. It seems like there is something for every one - adventure, aliens (some scary, some not), love stories, intriguing story lines and a great cast of actors. Enjoy!"
"The previous year, Christopher Eccleston brought us the 9th Doctor with Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) at his side as companion.  Unfortunately, Eccleston only did one year in the role.  Fortunately, upon him stepping down, David Tennant stepped up and into the role as the 10th Doctor - and what an *amazing* job he did.  More Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) to boot.  Tennant has been said by many viewers of the show to be the best Doctor ever, out of all the actors who've played the character over the years and decades.  And there is a lot of Doctor Who out there, years and years of material to watch, hundreds of stories.  That's high praise, but I found it well earned.  Rose is a good companion, and Tennant is truly one of the best actors to have left his mark on the show and the Doctor's character.  For Tennant ""Who"" fans, this is where it all began - his first year as The Doctor.  He also did a couple more series/seasons and a few specials as the 10th Doctor.  I don't think anyone who loves Doctor Who would be anything less than impressed by this series."
Of course everytime there is a new Doctor it's worrisome but not with David. Him and Billie have an amazing chemistry together. And the storylines are even better.This season had me laughing and crying on several occasions. And the finale...wow!
Love Season 2 even more than Season 1 of Dr Who. Builds on the emotion right up to the end! :) :) :) Totally worth watching again and again! One of my favorite seasons out of all of the new series (having watched up to series seven so far).
"Truly wonderful series.  I especially love the statistical information that is shared before each episode, then following which helps to explain some of the things and the way they were done in that era.  Beautifully written and acted."
"We are really enjoying this show.  If you like science and medicine, you will probably enjoy it.  They do a great job with the wounds, etc so it is not for the light stomached, if those things make you gross out."
"If you are a fan of historical drama's then you'll love London Hospital. It's based on true documents, records and personal notes. It tells  of the beginnings of the London hospital located in the roughest and poorest part of London and their successes and  self sacrifices in the face of danger and many illnesses before medicine as we know it today."
"How our ancestors suffered, even a bare hundred years ago, whether they were the patients or the staff of the biggest charity hospital for the poor in turn of the century London. Medicine was advancing in 1906, just not fast enough to stem the tide of suffering brought on by injury and disease aided and abetted by poverty. Asepsis (sterile and clean conditions) had been discovered and developed as had chloroform and ether as surgical anesthetics, primitive (and dangerous) x-ray technology, but antibiotics, intravenous solutions, imaging technology that didn't kill the patient on its own and a simple sugar and water solution to keep people from dying from dehydration were decades in the future, along with many, many other things.The body had been well anatomized and diseases were documented and described. The problem was the paucity of treatments that worked. The brave men and women who tried to turn the tide are everyday heroes and should remind us of the nurses who still take care of us.People suffered from birth defects, malnutrition, infectious diseases, diseases of aging and poverty, industrial accidents and gang warfare all of it grimed in a coat of dirt and vermin that the nurses struggled to stem. Every, every, everything was dirty at a time when cleaning required ten times the work it does today. Nurses were also expected to be married to the hospital, not allowed to marry or see a man romantically and this went on to the forties.The stories in London Hospital are all taken from life be it newspaper articles, hospital records or personal memoirs. The producers have also gone to some trouble to make the procedures and illnesses real in a stomach churning, toe curling manner. Other reviewers have criticized this as an attempt to shock. I agree it is shocking, but it is necessary to have even a prayer of taking the viewer back to the genuine suffering of this era. Drama with the staff is interspersed with the cases but London Hospital is a piece of medical history that is profound in its depiction and its implications. Very highly recommended but not for the faint of heart. Many of the medical scenes are truly grisly and watching the dead die all over again is affecting. I loved Call the Midwife, but I have never seen anything like London Hospital. An original."
Very informative and interesting characters. It teaches a history lesson of early medicine with medical innovations and life before vaccines. Enjoyed it very much.
"London Hospital is a look at how healthcare has evolved since the 1900's. Some scenes are graphic and might be a turn off to some but it's historical background is priceless. The hardships that patients, doctors, nurses, and administration faced during that period is interesting and adds to the history of medical science."
I have only watched three epeisodes but have loved every minute! The historical based drama has me hooked. I look forward to seeing more of the characters and their development. The account of British medicine and its development is fascinating.
Great show!  Well researched and presented!  Actual records used for story!  Shows how brutal the conditions were for the poor.
"I am so happy to have found this great series. I like the historical background and also that most of the main characters were real people. The acting is superb, for the most part, and I also enjoy seeing this snapshot of the state of health care 100 years ago. The story lines in the first season are all relevant and interesting."
"Wonderful combination of solid plots and historical accuracy. Enjoyed watching it, and learned some history I hadn't known. Evn if history isn't your favorite, this show is worth watching simply because it is so well done."
"Based on the date of the series, it appears to be a one time thing. The series is well acted, and does depict actual events (or so it says in the overview). I am finding myself drawn more and more to the British TV series. I believe the British story tellers can make something out of nothing. Our U.S. studios can take a lesson from these shows. While American film and TV is dependent upon too much money to produce, most British TV and Movies are made on a very small budget. The British productions depend on acting and story line. That is something the American story tellers should try."
"The story line is based on actual records from the early 1900s. The writing, acting and directing are all pleasant."
"If the BBC produces it, I usually give it a chance.  This is a drama not a mystery but it is tense and absorbing.  It is based on true events but it in no way represents a ""boring"" documentary.  It did make me appreciate how far medicine and societal attitudes have advanced in a relatively short time period.  I watched all the episodes and was sorry the series ended."
Watching this is like watching ER set in London in 1906. The production values are fabulous and the performances as you would expect -- great. Don't miss it.
"This was a solid show that I had avoided watching because it only ran the two seasons. Watched it when I was low on good programs and should have passed as it's frustrating to see a first rate production end so quickly. I have no idea why they pulled the plug, UK programs will often have short runs, but this was a fine show and could have had a nice long run. It was five star while it lasted."
I really loved watching this series and the reality of how life was in London so many years ago. The situations are heart breaking but things that actually do occurr in life. Amazing cast!!!
"When my sister-in-law and daughter, both in the health care field, highly recommended this series, I was interested. My husband and I had previously enjoyed viewing other historical series including Call the Midwife, Dutchess of Duke Street, and Foyle's War, becoming disappointed when we reached the final episodes. We had been looking for an additional good series, and this fits the bill quite well - interesting story lines, good characters, factual basis - who could ask for more?"
this is a excellent show! I am enjoying learning about how medicine was practiced in the early 1900s. I love the fact that the stories are based on actual history and not made up. We need more show like this on tv...
"This series was created from actual case notes, manuscripts, diaries, papers and other ephemera done by and for the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel.  As a result it is a clear window into the history of the London and into the history of medicine. Heartwarming AND heartbreaking. Frequently disturbing and difficult to watch. Not softened by Hollywood but done in acid by British writers Colin Heber-Percy and Lyall B. Watson. The whole thing is brilliant - the acting, the sets, the costumes, the actors, the scripts... wonderful series!You can also find it by the other names it was produced under: Casualty 1906, Casualty 1907 and Casualty 1909. Searches for `The London' frequently can't find it.You can buy the 4 dvd set - Casualty 1900s  - but only in region 2 so if you are in the US you will need a region free dvd player..."
I just love this series! I wish there were more than 2 seasons. I like the characters & the historical story line. It makes one realize how far medicine has come.
"What a well made series, each series is not only entertaining but historical. The acting is superb. The writing is so thought provoking. I feel this is quite a wonderful way to become familiar with our history."
"Love Bramwell, Love Downton Abbey, love most BBC period pieced made before 2000, but the bouncing camera and garbled dialog made this one unwatchable. Is it really necessary to shake the camera around all the time? Without subtitles, this one is hopeless."
As a fan of General Hospital - I thought this show would be a London version...not so. Its incredibly graphic but also based on true stories found in records and notes from the hospital's history. The dedication of these nurses is far surpassing of even nurses today...and I count several nurses as friends.
"I love this series, hoping to see season 3.  The detail that goes into re-creating a hospital at the turn of the century, with all the equipment, is stunning."
"Gripping, history rich with facts. The raw human suffering of east London during the turn of the last century was unbelievable.  Great actors.  Where are the next seasons?  There must be more........"
"If you are a fan of British TV and Movies with a little history thrown in, you will really like this series.  For me it wasn't long enough."
"This show, which is based on newspaper articles, hospital records, and patient memoirs, recounts the stories of both caregivers and patients at a hospital at the turn-of-the century in London's East End.  Many facts are given about healthcare at that time, and at the end of each show, there are also updates about what happened to certain characters.  I have learned a great deal: many children were alcoholics, technicians in charge of taking early x-rays were subject to radiation burns and death; there was a growing realization about the importance of cleanliness, although gloves were not yet worn.  The characters are well-cast: the hospital matron especially is able to convey the deep concern for patients but yet the sadness she feels at not being able to marry because nurses were not allowed to continue working once wed.  The show is entertaining and informative."
London Hospital Season 1 could be called a Grey's Anatomy for the previous centuries.  I have only watched episode 1 but will watch more
I was looking for a good series to watch and found this by accident. It is factually and brutally honest. The acting to superb.
"As and X-ray tecnologist having spent most of my adult life in hospitals I find this show most intresting, it shows the early days of X-ray and the great dangers that one faced back it the early days.  A wonderful period peice."
"Watching the first episode I was not quite sold but in the second I fell for it completely. Set in London royal hospital starting in 1906 and based on recorded cases this BBC drama is compelling and watchable. Some of the societal problems we face now we're faced then by the doctors and nurses of the time. The primary setting is the casualty, E.R. Which then as now is often the gateway to a hospital. There were some major differences the, the E.R. Closed at night and patients lined up at the gates to be treated in the morning, not a second before the ordained time. And there were strict codes of conduct for doctors and nurses, rigid codes. One of the nurses is torn between her love of a handsome doctor and her true calling Another compelling character is the seemingly strict and cold matron, who really loves her nurses and patients."
This is what television is all about!  Hope there is more to come.  It gives you a real appreciation for what these women endured during those rugged times.
"This is a very good drama, one I have never seen on American TV.  It is certainly worth watching.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys BBC entertainment or public television dramas."
"I'm English, so this show is special to me..I loved it, and they are true stories..a must watch if interested in history."
I love London Hospital there is never a dull movement. The actors are all wonderful! I would love to see more episodes.
"Very clinical but entertaining too. If you're into period drama, there is some character development missing but it's still a good program."
"This series allows you to step back one hundred years into the days of no antibiotics, no surgical masks or gloves, and the painkiller of choice was morphine. Also, cocaine was legal! The main characters are doctors and nurses, struggling to do the best they can for their patients within the strict social guidelines of the Victorian age."
I even talked to my doctor and said this stuff is pretty accurate since he's old enough to remember some of it.  Also a great story.
"When people long for those glorious days of the past, it usually means they have no idea what life was like during the revered era.  Life in London's East End circa 1906 is not something anyone would want to relive, but watching it is fascinating.London Hospital recaptures the era in a most extraordinary way. The opening credits give us some startling information. They tell us that The London (as the hospital was known) dealt with extreme povery and disease in the East End.  And that it had the most successful emergency room of the era--and still does.We learn that one child in seven died before having a fifth birthday, and an adult could hope to survive for 45 years at best.  Antibiotics and The National Health Service were still some 40 years in the future.  (In some countries, including the United States, there is still no national health care program and people die of treatable diseases every day. In the U.S., for-profit insurance companies, not doctors, decide who will and who will not receive treatment, how that treatment will be dispensed, and how much of it the patient may receive. Insurance companies spend countless millions of dollars convincing Americans we are better off this way and most Americans believe them.) Infection was the great killer...of patients and staff.  (New strains of treatment-resistant bacteria are making this statement true in our time.)  The series is based on actual case records, memoirs and newspaper stories.Medicine had made amazing progress by 1906.  X-rays were the new miracle...but a costly one. X-ray technicials gradually lost their fingers, then their hands before radiationsickness klled them outright.  Another big breakthrough was the use of UV lamps to heal infections...no one guessed what the side effects would be. But despite these amazing new discoveries, most diagnoses were made by guess and by golly. Science was still in its infancy, compared to where we are now and the amazing progress made in just 100 years.In 1906, women with almost any problem were diagnosed with 'hysteria'(from the Greek for 'womb,' as doctors were quick to point out) and given a most interesting course of treatment to calm them.  Surgery was brutal, anesthesia was primitive, there were no wonder drugs, no EKGs, no IV drips, and no blood pressure or heart monitors.  Doctors thought electricity, that new-fangled miracle, must have some medical use, so they tried shocking the sick and broken into good health. And you could not pull the plug on a patient.  There were no plugs to pull. Besides, death almost always beat you to the punch without any assistance.Despite the clumsy and sometimes deadly methods, London Hospital was a beacon. It was clean, orderly and disciplined, qualities that did not abound in the East End. The staff was dedicated. This was a time when nurses were still called ""Sister"" and were forbidden to marry. In fact, it was not until the 1940s that nurses at London Hospital were permitted to do so. It was not a profession, it was a calling, and if the title ""Sister"" and costumes seem similar to those of nuns, the comparison is an apt one.The series focuses primarily on the nursing staff.  Eva Luckes, the hospital matron and chief of the nursing staff is admirably played by Cherie Lunghi.  She combines exactly the right proportions of stiff post-Victorian propriety, discipline and warmth. The doctors and nurses, the hospital staff and patients are all very well presented, their stories are compelling, and it is very easy to become addicted to the series. Each episode stands alone, but there are recurring story lines and characters, including my favorite, a young tough named Knobby Clark, a youthful and charismatic east end villian who is both a helpful ally to the hospital and frequent patient.  There are love stories, tragedies, and a very few happy endings.Some of the scenes are hard to watch. We get a bird's eye view of surgeries performed with tools that today's amateur carpenters would find crude...and we also see the aftermath...not just the infections and the pain, but what happened to working men who lost limbs...and what happened to their families when the breadwinner was crippled and compensation was left to the good graces and generosity of the employers. The mortality rate for children was enormous and their diseases not pretty. Again, the viewer is not spared much.Thomas Hobbes describes life ""in nature,"" that is without laws or society, as ""continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.""  Edwardian England was not short on laws nor on rules of society. They did not help the people of the East End for whom the quotation adequately and succinctly describes daily existence.This series might be described the same way, were it not for the intelligence and compassion of the characters, the wit and style of the writing, and the exceptional production values.  By all means, if you have any interest in history or medicine, or just want to enjoy a tremendously entertaining piece of television, add this to your viewing list.  It may be one of the best things I have ever seen on television...although I don't want to damn the series with faint praise."
"to to bloody,but true to the times !Makes you glad that you were not there during that time period! worth watching."
"Being a nurse, it is so interesting to see how nursing was in this era.  Also seeing all the technology and medical procedures that were started in London!  Just a really well made show.  The characters are totally believable.  Well done!"
"Great reality show!  Recommended by an English friend and I knew it wud b realist ic.  Great storyline, characters, etc."
"When episode 1 first opens, I was wondering what the heck is this? It shows old photos of a hospital in London, the captions tell us that 1 in 7 children died during the turn of the century, most people did not live past 45 - and, the list goes on. Then the story begins. I was glued to the screen. Between the fast pace, the getting to know the characters, the information about our medical history, and so on - I stayed up half the night watching half of the first season. I love this show and hope there are more to come."
"I could not believe how well done and interesting this series was I loved it ! So accurate to the timeline ! Great case histories ! I could not believe how reasonable the whole series was ! Highly , highly recommend it !"
"I'm a history buff and so really, really enjoy this series. The characters are so endearing and the struggles they go through to treat the people are heartrending at times. It's rather amazing what the hospital staff could accomplish at that time. Wonderful program!"
"One of the best I have seen, watch both seasons you won't be disappointed. In fact you will be wanting more, hopefully they will have a season 3."
"basically a dramatization of real events in London hospital in early 1900's.  as an ER doc myself right now, I see the similarities of the workings of an urban hospital among the poorest of the poor in the 1900's and how our &#34;modern&#34; ER's work today.  It is uncanny really how little we have learned about how to care for masses of poor folk.  The characters in this series are believable and historic yet are so well rendered as to be fascinating."
"History, Medical History...its great!! I learn so much from this show that I did not know, I love history and this is a fine series, I could not say enough about it."
This series was so well done!  I wish there would have been more than two seasons of it.  Highly recommend!
"A surprise for those of us not growing up in London. To know these episodes are based on real stories makes watching each episode almost unbelievable, but the interest is still there. Nurses had such a struggle working in a crowded hospital. Doctors, who made little to no salary, are a variety of good and indifferent. I hope there are many more seasons."
"This is a great  program, if you like period drama this has it all. The detail is amazing and all based on events that really happened, a very good history lesson, I found it more interesting as I know the area well and spent some time there in the 50's.five big stars from me."
This is an absolutely wonderful series.  I love the information that is shared to show the reality behind the show.  As a healthcare professional it was so interesting to see the portrayal of changes in medicine over the years.  Very well written and played.
Season two follows with the same excellent cast and true stories of the London hospital and the advancement of medicine as well as the personal lives of the staff.
Reminds me of how fortunate we are to have the advancement in the medical practices.  Very humbling that so many died and through their deaths our healthcare is so improved.Acting is superb.
"This is a history drama of early 20th century medicine with plenty of story line to go with the difficulties uncovered about early medicine. Each episode covers another medical struggle from disease, social poverty, the legalities of suicide versus medical treatment and progression in anesthesia during operations.I have enjoyed this series and hope future seasons will appear on prime Kindle."
"Season 2 is just as great as Season 1. Love taking a look back at medical history. Season 2 is just as graphic in terms of surgery and blood that only adds to the experience. Viewing the history of the doctors, nurses, and administration during the early 1900's shows how rough they had it but the dedication was something else."
I was so disappointed that it came to an  end. I had invested time and interest in these characters and wanted to see more. I enjoyed watching the progeression of medicine in London during this period and comparing it to today's doctors and nurses.Would like more series in this vein.
"I truly hope there will be another season of this wonderful series. Season 2 explores story lines more relevant to current times, which kind of disappointed me. I liked the historical sense of each episode, feeling almost immersed in the temporal environs of a 19th century hospital."
Too bad this series never went beyond season two. It has everything a good series should have. The characters are human rather than unrealistic and the viewer can relate to their situations. You found yourself drawn into the plot. That each episode largely stood alone didn't matter. You wanted to know what happened in the next episode because there was just enough plot carry over to keep you hooked. The series provided medical and social history in context and in a way that was simply fascinating. I learned things about the history of medicine that totally surprised me. This is a little like what happened to the series Firefly. Somewhere a group of executives are kicking themselves for cutting short a real money maker.
I love period shows especially dramatizations of real life events and this show was definitely one of the  great ones.  The suffering of the very poor and the politics involved in relation to running a hospital made the show interesting.
I could watch a whole lot more of this series.  The character development is very interesting and easy to follow
I enjoyed every minute of Season one and two.  I was very sorry there was not more.  Excellent acting.  Very realistic. I enjoy the historical aspect of the show as well as the drama that was weaved in to make it very interesting.  I would definitely recommend.  A little graffic but so were the times in medicine.  Knowledge we limited and they did the best they could.
"Amazed to see that show is based on actual records, etc. Interesting to see how far medical procedures has come and how barbaric it once was."
Watching this is like watching ER set in London in 1906-09. The production values are fabulous and the performances as you would expect -- great. Don't miss it.
"Seeing how the poor were treated medically by people with a passion for caring for others is heart warming.  The trial and tribulations faced in that day without our technology.  However, they made do and saved a lot of people."
"I was really hooked on the first season and so excited to see the second one. I was not disappointed at all! Again, wonderful cast and such an intense program.  To amazon i ask, where are the other seasons???? will there be more available????"
Another excellent episode although it almost got knocked back to 4 stars . the reason is i didnt really see the reason for trying to jam a love story in a hour episode. but the ending restored it back to a 5 star review. i love this show but the writers are sometimes trying to jam to many stories in 1 episode..
"This was an eye opening series. Made me very happy with the care we now receive, even for the poorest. Great actors and story lines."
The cast in London Hospital is first rate.  The realistic presentation of how miserable life was for the poor and how injuries and disease were treated in the 19th century makes one appreciate the advances in medicine that are available today.
This is a wonderful period series based on true stories.  The cast is wonderful.  The writing is A1 and I would recommend to anyone who loves period pieces.
Great acting and great history!  Now I'm looking for season 1.  How far the medical industry has come in 100 years!
This is by far one of the best written and most historically acurate shows I have seen in a long time. Stumbled across the first series a week ago and have spent every evening since watching it. It is interesting and pulls you in. Would recommend to anyone!
I wish there were more seasons! :-(  I watched the two seasons in a sort or marathon and wanted more at the end.
"London Hospital is a real place and the cases presented during the episodes are drawn from hospital records and newspaper articles of the time. Of course there are romantic and plot embellishments, but good acting in general weaves them seamlessly into the narrative.  This was a critical time not only medically in terms of discoveries (e.g. infectious processes and anesthesia) but also socially.  London's East End was a boiling melting pot of displaced eastern Europeans and anarchists.  Grinding poverty shored up the booming Victorian society and economy at a terrible price.  The London Hospital and its stories reflect the human cost.Well written, well acted... forgive the occasional General Hospital soap bubble."
"I've just finished the second season of London Hospital and there is no season 3... This is one of the best series I have ever seen. It is in a class by itself. We really, really need another season!!"
This was a great series with good acting and true to the time period. London Hospital was ahead of it's time as far as treating the sick and injured. It was fascinating to see how people were treated and that the hospital opened at 8am with patients lined up at the gate. London Hospital pioneered new treatments and procedures while treating the poor. I loved that they smoked in the operating rooms while working on patients as the patients drank a cup of tea!  If you like history and medicine you should watch this series.
"Great acting, costumes and of course story line (since they used real life, not made up situations).  it is amazing how much they knew about trauma way back then.  You will enjoy this!"
"I love British programs! This series is very good because of the historical information along with the character interactions. I was a nurse for &#62;30 yrs.& can't imagine working under those conditions, especially since nurses were not allowed to marry. it was like being a nun, being married to the work. Not to mention it was very hard work- washing & disinfecting everything by hand."
"My only complaint, 2 seasons??? Please bring us more we love the stories and characters.  I'll be telling my friends and family to watch."
"I SHOULD SAY DID IT AGAIN. WHY WOULD ANYONE CANCEL THIS FIVE STAR SHOW?  IT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES. THE DRAMA IS REAL LIFE, THE MEDICAL TERMS ARE PERFECT FOR THAT ERA AND THE ACTING SURPERB. REALITY TV AT ITS BEST. I WOULD GIVE THIS 10 STARS PLUS. LIKE A REALLY GOOD BOOK, I DID NOT WANT THIS TO END. YOU FEEL A LOSS AFTER. IT POPS INTO MY HEAD EVERY DAY. THATS THE SIGN OF A GOOD DRAMA... TOTALLY WORTH WATCHING EVEN IF IT IS JUST THE TWO SEASONS......CAT"
Season 2 is as good as season 1. This series is based on real cases and all this was before all the drugs we have around now.
"This is an absolutely fascinating series, rich with the history of London hospital, life in the slums and tenements of the era, and an engrossing look at the development of medical advances, such as xray and anesthesia.  Highly recommended!"
This season is even better than season one.  It continues to provide excellent interesting stories.  Wish it had more seasons to watch.
"What can I say, I was hooked on this series. The acting was wonderful and the historic details were sobering."
This is what television is all about!  Hope there is more to come.  There should be a real appreciation for what these women endured during those rugged times.
"We enjoyed the writing, and the characters were strong. The nice part is that even though you got enough information to care about the characters, the patient care and the way it was done at the time was very interesting."
"I loved is early 1900 version of &#34;ER&#34;  As a history geek I liked the peek at the realities of health care at that time, and the acting and drama just kept me wanting more"
I loved this show!  I wish there were about 5 more seasons...  I'm still thinking about it and I watched the last episode over a week ago!
"London Hospital is the true story of this hospital's beginnings, as based on newspaper reports, diaries and other information.It gives a realistic portrayal of how the nursing professional came about, and how hospitals were founded.  The scripts are realistic, and the acting is great."
Love the history of the way things used to be.  Acting is terrific.  Characters are brought to life through history. Can't wait for series 3
The storyline is more entertaining than season 1. Still lacking in character development but the clinical side makes up for it. Wish it had another season.
"The second season of London Hospital, extends the essential story line of the first season and does so consistently and with deep emotion. The viewer cannot be unmoved by this show as the characters are finely drawn and the portrayal of the time is exceptional. This show is a learning experience for the viewer as the characters make great medical strides against killers such as burns and scarlet fever. Nurses were always unmarried women who often dedicated their lives to the London, the great hospital of the East End that served the poor of London with precision and decency.Of course, I wish the show had gone on for a third season as I enjoyed it enormously."
found it to be very interesting and knowledgeable for the time era.  wished there were more seasons.  would watch them all.
